Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely
indeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on
“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for
the law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,
having submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the
Ephors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on
to those who came after him would be less than what he had received
from those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς

the comment, ὅσῳ γὰρ ἂν ἐλαττόνων ὦσι κύριοι, πλείω χρόνον ἀναγκαῖον

αὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from
Aristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should
be well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an
instance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of
Greece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and
popular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name
of a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian
King exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the
Landammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule
according to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom
according to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal
Republic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss
the comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies
with any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly
fixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages
over republican forms of government, just as republican forms of
government have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether
the people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the
House of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the
polling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,
than they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much
it may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be
removed before the end of its term of office, except on the legal
proof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no
reason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held
to be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the
Established Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows
simple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word
“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do
not find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied
to the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are
just those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or
in present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,
but they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the
country at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics
and to discuss Greek particles; but they have learned nothing from
the treasures of wisdom taught by Grecian history from Herodotus to
Polybios.I have discussed the three chief forms of executive government, the
constitutional King and his Ministry, the President, and the Executive
Council, in the last of my first series of Historical Essays.250:—

MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.But, meanwhile, their noble
young author lived a sad and weary life--depressed by the fear that
his best hopes would never be realized--harassed by pecuniary
difficulties, and tormented by the most cruel persecution.Next, he
went to Upsala, where he still employed himself upon periodical
literature, and had an interval of comparative quiet and happiness.Thence, he travelled to Hamburg, and afterwards to Copenhagen.Here
he remained half a year, living a quiet, studious life, and
associating with some of the most eminent men in the city."Those
days," said he, "were the best I ever had."Certainly, they were very
fruitful ones.In them he produced one complete work, parts of
several others, and the first half of "Synnove Solbakken," the tale
which was destined to place him in the foremost rank of Scandinavian
writers.It is a remarkable fact that shortly before he left
Copenhagen with all this heap of wealth, he had passed through a
crisis of such miserable depression that he was just about to abandon
literary labor for ever, through a sense of utter unfitness to
perform it.From Copenhagen, Herr Bjoernson returned to Norway, and was for two
years manager of the theatre at Bergen, occupying most of the time in
the training of actors.Thence he went, with his young wife, again to
Christiana, where he for some months edited _Aftenbladet_, one of
the leading Norwegian journals.Relative to Herr Bjoernson's subsequent life and labors, there is but
very little available information.*       *       *       *       *

Of our own part in the following pages, we have but to say we have
earnestly endeavored to deal faithfully and reverently with Herr
Bjoernson's work, and to render nearly every passage as fully and
literally as the construction of the two languages permits.The only
exceptions are two very short, and comparatively very unimportant
passages, which we have ventured to omit, because we believed they
would render the book less acceptable to English readers.CHAPTER                                         PAGE

ARNE.I.

HOW THE CLIFF WAS CLAD.Between two cliffs lay a deep ravine, with a full stream rolling
heavily through it over boulders and rough ground.It was high and
steep, and one side was bare, save at the foot, where clustered a
thick, fresh wood, so close to the stream that the mist from the
water lay upon the foliage in spring and autumn.The trees stood
looking upwards and forwards, unable to move either way."What if we were to clothe the Cliff?"said the Juniper one day to
the foreign Oak that stood next him.The Oak looked down to find out
who was speaking, and then looked up again without answering a word.The Stream worked so hard that it grew white; the Northwind rushed
through the ravine, and shrieked in the fissures; and the bare Cliff
hung heavily over and felt cold."What if we were to clothe the
Cliff?"said the Juniper to the Fir on the other side."Well, if
anybody is to do it, I suppose we must," replied the Fir, stroking
his beard; "what dost thou think?"he added, looking over to the
Birch."In God's name, let us clothe it," answered the Birch,
glancing timidly towards the Cliff, which hung over her so heavily
that she felt as if she could scarcely breathe.And thus, although
they were but three, they agreed to clothe the Cliff.When they had gone a little way they met the Heather.The Juniper
seemed as though he meant to pass her by."Nay, let us take the
Heather with us," said the Fir."Lay hold on me," said the Heather.The
Juniper did so, and where there was only a little crevice the Heather
put in one finger, and where she had got in one finger the Juniper
put in his whole hand.They crawled and climbed, the Fir heavily
behind with the Birch."It is a work of charity," said the Birch.But the Cliff began to ponder what little things these could be that
came clambering up it.And when it had thought over this a few
hundred years, it sent down a little Brook to see about it.It was
just spring flood, and the Brook rushed on till she met the Heather."Dear, dear Heather, canst thou not let me pass?I am so little,"
said the Brook.The Heather, being very busy, only raised herself a
little, and worked on.The Brook slipped under her, and ran onwards."Dear, dear Juniper, canst thou not let me pass?I am so little,"
said the Brook.The Juniper glanced sharply at her; but as the
Heather had let her pass, he thought he might do so as well.The
Brook slipped under him, and ran on till she came where the Fir stood
panting on a crag."Dear, dear Fir, canst thou not let me pass?I am
so little," the Brook said, fondly kissing the Fir on his foot.The
Fir felt bashful and let her pass.But the Birch made way before the
Brook asked."He, he, he," laughed the Brook, as she grew larger."Ha, ha, ha," laughed the Brook again, pushing Heather and Juniper,
Fir and Birch, forwards and backwards, up and down on the great
crags.The Cliff sat for many hundred years after, pondering whether
it did not smile a little that day.It was clear the Cliff did not wish to be clad.The Heather felt so
vexed that she turned green again, and then she went on.The Juniper sat up to look at the Heather, and at last he rose to his
feet.He scratched his head a moment, and then he too went on again,
and clutched so firmly, that he thought the Cliff could not help
feeling it."If thou wilt not take me, then I will take thee," said
he.The Fir bent his toes a little to feel if they were whole, lifted
one foot, which he found all right, then the other, which was all
right too, and then both feet.He first examined the path he had
come, then where he had been lying, and at last where he had to go.Then he strode onwards, just as though he had never fallen.The Birch
had been splashed very badly, but now she got up and made herself
tidy.And so they went rapidly on, upwards and sidewards, in sunshine
and rain."But what in the world is all this?"said the Cliff, when
the summer sun shone, the dew-drops glittered, the birds sang, the
wood-mouse squeaked, the hare bounded, and the weasel hid and
screamed among the trees.Then the day came when the Heather could peep over the Cliff's edge."What is it the Heather
sees, dear?"said the Juniper, and came forwards till he, too, could
peep over."What's the matter
with the Juniper to-day?"said the Fir, taking long strides in the
hot sun.Soon he, too, by standing on tiptoes could peep over.--every branch and prickle stood on end with astonishment.He
strode onwards, and over he went."What is it they all see, and not
I?"said the Birch, lifting up her skirts, and tripping after.said she, putting her head over, "there is a whole forest, both of
Fir and Heather, and Juniper and Birch, waiting for us on the plain;"
and her leaves trembled in the sunshine till the dew-drops fell."This comes of reaching forwards," said the Juniper.His mother's name was Margit, and she was the only child at the farm,
Kampen.In her eighteenth year she once stayed too long at a dancing
party.The friends she came with had left, and then she thought the
way homewards would be just the same whether she stayed over another
dance or not.So it came to pass that she was still sitting there
when the fiddler, Nils, the tailor, laid aside his violin and asked
another man to play.He then took out the prettiest girl to dance,
his feet keeping as exact time as the music to a song, while with his
bootheel he kicked off the hat of the tallest man there.As Margit walked home that night, the moonbeams played upon the snow
with such strange beauty, that after she had gone up to her
bedchamber she felt she must look out at them once more.She took off
her bodice, but remained standing with it in her hand.Then she felt
chilly, undressed herself hastily, and crouched far down beneath the
fur coverlet.That night she dreamed of a great red cow which had
gone astray in the corn-fields.She wished to drive it out, but
however much she tried, she could not move from the spot; and the cow
stood quietly, and went on eating till it grew plump and satisfied,
from time to time looking over to her with its large, mild eyes.The next time there was a dance in the parish, Margit was there.She
sat listening to the music, and cared little for the dancing that
night; and she was glad somebody else, too, cared no more for it than
she did.But when it grew later the fiddler, Nils, the tailor, rose,
and wished to dance.He went straight over and took out Margit, and
before she well knew what she was doing she danced with him.Soon the weather turned warmer, and there was no more dancing.That
spring Margit took so much care of a little sick lamb, that her
mother thought her quite foolish."It's only a lamb, after all," said
the mother."Yes; but it's sick," answered Margit.It was a long time since Margit had been to church; somebody must
stay at home, she used to say, and she would rather let the mother
go.One Sunday, however, later in the summer, the weather seemed so
fine that the hay might very well be left over that day and night,
the mother said, and she thought both of them might go.Margit had
nothing to say against it, and she went to dress herself.But when
they had gone far enough to hear the church bells, she suddenly burst
into tears.The mother grew deadly pale; yet they went on to church,
heard the sermon and prayers, sang all the hymns, and let the last
sound of the bells die away before they left.But when they were
seated at home again, the mother took Margit's face between her
hands, and said, "Keep back nothing from me, my child!"When another winter came Margit did not dance.But Nils, the tailor,
played and drank more than ever, and always danced with the prettiest
girl at every party.People then said, in fact, he might have had any
one of the first girls in the parish for his wife if he chose; and
some even said that Eli Boeen had himself made an offer for his
daughter, Birgit, who had quite fallen in love with him.But just at that time an infant born at Kampen was baptized, and
received the name, Arne; but Nils, the tailor, was said to be its
father.On the evening of the same day, Nils went to a large wedding-party;
and there he got drunk.He would not play, but danced all the time,
and seemed as if he could hardly bear to have any one on the floor
save himself.But when he asked Birgit Boeen to dance, she refused.He
gave a short, forced, laugh, turned on his heel and asked the first
girl at hand.She was a little dark girl who had been sitting looking
at him, but now when he spoke to her, she turned pale and drew back.He looked down, leaned slightly over her, and whispered, "Won't you
dance with _me_, Kari?"He repeated his question,
and then she replied, also in a whisper, "That dance might go further
than I wished."He drew back slowly; but when he reached the middle
of the room, he made a quick turn, and danced the _halling_[1] alone,
while the rest looked on in silence.[1] The _halling_ is a Norwegian national dance, of which a
 description is given on pp.Afterwards, he went away into the barn, lay down, and wept.Margit stayed at home with little Arne.When she heard how Nils
rushed from dancing-party to dancing-party, she looked at the child
and wept, but then she looked at him once more and was happy.The
first name she taught him to say was, father; but this she dared not
do when the mother, or the grandmother, as she was now called, was
near; and so it came to pass that the little one called the
grandmother, "Father."Margit took great pains to break him of this,
and thus she caused an early thoughtfulness in him.He was but a
little fellow when he learned that Nils, the tailor, was his father;
and just when he came to the age when children most love strange,
romantic things, he also learned what sort of man Nils was.But the
grandmother had strictly forbidden the very mention of his name; her
mind was set only upon extending Kampen and making it their own
property, so that Margit and the boy might be independent.Taking
advantage of the landowner's poverty, she bought the place, paid off
part of the purchase-money every year, and managed her farm like a
man; for she had been a widow fourteen years.Under her care, Kampen
had been extended till it could now feed four cows, sixteen sheep,
and a horse of which she was joint owner.Meantime, Nils, the tailor, continued to go about working in the
parish; but he had less to do than formerly, partly because he was
less attentive to his trade, and partly because he was not so well
liked.Then he took to going out oftener to play the fiddle at
parties; this gave him more opportunities for drinking, and thus came
more fighting and miserable days.One winter day, when Arne was about six years old, he was playing on
the bed, where he had set up the coverlet for a boat-sail, while he
sat steering with a ladle.The grandmother sat in the room spinning,
busy with her own thoughts, and every now and then nodding, as though
in affirmation of her own conclusions.Then the boy knew she was
taking no notice of him; and so he sang, just as he had learned it, a
wild, rough song about Nils, the tailor:--

   "Unless 'twas only yesterday, hither first you came,
    You've surely heard already of Nils, the tailor's fame.Unless 'twas but this morning, you came among us first,
    You've heard how he knocked over tall Johan Knutson Kirst;

    How in his famous barn-fight with Ola Stor-Johann,
    He said, 'Bring down your porridge when we two fight again.'That fighting fellow, Bugge, a famous man was he:
    His name was known all over fiord and fell and sea.'Now, choose the place, you tailor, where I shall knock you down;
    And then I'll spit upon it, and there I'll lay your crown.''Ah, only come so near, I may catch your scent, my man:
    Your bragging hurts nobody; don't dream it ever can.'The first round was a poor one, and neither man could beat;
    But both kept in their places, and steady on their feet.The second round, poor Bugge was beaten black and blue.The third round, Bugge tumbled, and bleeding there he lay.'Now, Bugge, where's your bragging?'This was all the boy sang; but there were two verses more which the
mother had never taught him.The grandmother knew these last verses
only too well; and she remembered them all the better because the boy
did not sing them.She said nothing to him, however, but to the
mother, she said, "If you think it well to teach him the first
verses, don't forget to teach him the last ones, too."Nils, the tailor, was so broken down by his drinking, that he was not
like the same man; and people began to say he would soon be utterly
ruined.About this time a wedding was celebrated in the neighborhood, and two
American gentlemen, who were visiting near, came to witness it, as
they wished to see the customs of the country.Nils played; and the
two gentlemen each gave a dollar for him, and then asked for the
_halling_.But no one came forward to dance it; and several begged
Nils himself to come: "After all, he was still the best dancer," they
said.He refused; but their request became still more urgent, and at
last all in the room joined in it.This was just what he wanted; and
at once he handed his fiddle to another man, took off his jacket and
cap, and stepped smilingly into the middle of the room.They all came
round to look at him, just as they used to do in his better days, and
this gave him back his old strength.They crowded closely together,
those farthest back standing on tables and benches.Several of the
girls stood higher than all the rest; and the foremost of them--a
tall girl, with bright auburn hair, blue eyes, deeply set under a
high forehead, and thin lips, which often smiled and then drew a
little to one side--was Birgit Boeen: Nils caught her eye as he
glanced upwards at the beam.The music struck up; a deep silence
ensued; and he began.He squatted on the floor, and hopped sidewards
in time with the music; swung from one side to another, crossed, and
uncrossed his legs under him several times; sprang up again, and
stood as though he were going to take a leap; but then shirked it,
and went on hopping sidewards as before.The fiddle was skilfully
played, and the tune became more and more exciting.Nils gradually
threw his head backwarder, and then suddenly kicked the beam,
scattering the dust from the ceiling down upon the people below.They
laughed and shouted round him, and the girls stood almost breathless.The sound of the violin rose high above the noise, stimulating him by
still wilder notes, and he did not resist their influence.He bent
forward; hopped in time with the music; stood up as though he were
going to take a leap, but shirked it, swung from one side to the
other as before; and just when he looked as if he had not the least
thought of leaping, leaped up and kicked the beam again and again.Next he turned somersaults forwards and backwards, coming upon his
feet firmly, and standing up quite straight each time.Then he
suddenly left off; and the tune, after running through some wild
variations, died away in one long, deep note on the bass.The crowd
dispersed, and an animated conversation in loud tones followed the
silence.Nils leaned against the wall; and the American gentlemen,
with their interpreter, went over to him, each giving him five
dollars.The Americans said a few words aside to their interpreter, who then
asked Nils whether he would go with them as their servant.Nils asked, while the people crowded round as closely as possible."Out into the world," was the answer.Nils asked, as he
looked round him with a bright face; his eyes fell on Birgit Boeen,
and he did not take them off again."In a week's time when they come
back here," answered the interpreter."Well, perhaps I may then be
ready," said Nils, weighing his ten dollars, and trembling so
violently, that a man on whose shoulder he was resting one arm, asked
him to sit down."Oh, it's nothing," he answered, and he took a few faltering steps
across the floor, then, some firmer ones, turned round, and asked for
a springing-dance.He looked slowly round, and
then went straight over to one in a dark  skirt: it was Birgit
Boeen.He stretched forth his hand, and she gave both hers; but he
drew back with a laugh, took out a girl who stood next, and danced
off gaily.Birgit's face and neck flushed crimson; and in a moment a
tall, mild-looking man, who was standing behind her, took her hand
and danced away with her just after Nils.He saw them, and whether
purposely or not, pushed against them so violently that they both
fell heavily to the floor.Loud cries and laughter were heard all
round.Birgit rose, went aside, and cried bitterly.Her partner rose more slowly, and went straight over to Nils, who was
still dancing: "You must stop a little," he said.Nils did not hear;
so the other man laid hold on his arm.He tore himself away, looked
at the man, and said with a smile, "I don't know you.""P'r'aps not; but now I'll let you know who I am," said the man,
giving him a blow just over one eye.Nils was quite unprepared for
this, and fell heavily on the sharp edge of the fireplace.He tried
to rise, but he could not: his spine was broken.At Kampen, a change had taken place.Of late the grandmother had
become more infirm, and as she felt her strength failing, she took
greater pains than ever to save money to pay off the remaining debt
upon the farm."Then you and the boy," she used to say to Margit,
"will be comfortably off.And mind, if ever you bring anybody into
the place to ruin it for you, I shall turn in my grave."In
harvest-time, she had the great satisfaction of going up to the late
landowner's house with the last of the money due to him; and happy
she felt when, seated once more in the porch at home, she could at
last say, "Now it's done."But in that same hour she was seized with
her last illness; she went to bed at once, and rose no more.Margit
had her buried in the churchyard, and a nice headstone was set over
her, inscribed with her name and age, and a verse from one of
Kingo's hymns.A fortnight after her burial, her black Sunday gown
was made into a suit of clothes for the boy; and when he was dressed
in them he became as grave as even the grandmother herself.He went
of his own accord and took up the book with clasps and large print
from which she used to read and sing every Sunday; he opened it, and
there he found her spectacles.These he had never been allowed to
touch while she was living; now he took them out half fearfully,
placed them over his nose, and looked down through them into the
book."How strange this is," he thought; "it was
through them grandmother could read God's word!"He held them high up
against the light to see what was the matter, and--the spectacles
dropped on the floor, broken in twenty pieces.He was much frightened, and when at the same moment the door opened,
he felt as if it must be the grandmother herself who was coming in.But it was the mother, and behind her came six men, who, with much
stamping and noise, brought in a litter which they placed in the
middle of the room.The door was left open so long after them, that
the room grew quite cold.On the litter lay a man with a pale face and dark hair.The mother
walked to and fro and wept."Be careful how you lay him on the bed,"
she said imploringly, helping them herself.But all the while the men
were moving him, something grated beneath their feet."Ah, that's
only grandmother's spectacles," the boy thought; but he said
nothing.It was, as we have said before, just harvest-time.A week after the
day when Nils had been carried into Margit Kampen's house, the
American gentlemen sent him word to get ready to go with them.He was
just then lying writhing under a violent attack of pain; and,
clenching his teeth, he cried, "Let them go to the devil!"Margit
remained waiting, as if she had not received any answer; he noticed
this, and after a while he repeated, faintly and slowly, "Let
them--go."As the winter advanced, he recovered so far as to be able to get up,
though his health was broken for life.The first day he could get up
he took his fiddle and tuned it; but it excited him so much that he
had to go to bed again.He talked very little, but was gentle and
kind, and soon he began to read with Arne, and to take in work.Still
he never went out; and he did not talk to those who came to see him.At first Margit used to tell him the news of the parish, but it made
him gloomy, and so she soon left off.When spring came he and Margit often sat longer than usual talking
together after supper, when Arne had been sent to bed.Later in the
season the banns of marriage were published for them, and then they
were quietly married.He worked on the farm, and managed wisely and steadily; and Margit
said to Arne, "He is industrious, as well as pleasant; now you must
be obedient and kind, and do your best for him."Margit had even in the midst of her trouble remained tolerably stout.She had rosy cheeks, large eyes, surrounded by dark circles which
made them seem still larger, full lips, and a round face; and she
looked healthy and strong, although she really had not much strength.Now, she looked better than ever; and she always sang at her work,
just as she used to do.Then one Sunday afternoon, the father and son went out to see how
things were getting on in the fields.Arne ran about, shooting with a
bow and arrows, which the father had himself made for him.Thus, they
went on straight towards the road which led past the church, and down
to the place which was called the broad valley.When they came there,
Nils sat down on a stone and fell into a reverie, while Arne went on
shooting, and running for his arrows along the road in the direction
of the church."Only not too far away," Nils said.Just as Arne was
at the height of his play, he stopped, listening, and called out,
"Father, I hear music."Nils, too, listened; and they heard the sound
of violins, sometimes drowned by loud, wild shouts, while above all
rose the rattling of wheels, and the trampling of horses' hoofs: it
was a bridal train coming home from the church."Come here, lad," the
father said, in a tone which made Arne feel he must come quickly.The
father had risen hastily, and now stood hidden behind a large tree.Arne followed till the father called out, "Not here, but go yonder!"Then the boy ran behind an elm-copse.The train of carriages had
already turned the corner of the birch-wood; the horses, white with
foam, galloping at a furious rate, while drunken people shouted and
hallooed.The father and Arne counted the carriages one after
another: there were fourteen.In the first, two fiddlers were
sitting; and the wedding tune sounded merrily through the clear air:
a lad stood behind driving.In the next carriage sat the bride, with
her crown and ornaments glittering in the sunshine.She was tall, and
when she smiled her mouth drew a little to one side; with her sat a
mild-looking man, dressed in blue.Then came the rest of the
carriages, the men sitting on the women's laps, and little boys
behind; drunken men riding six together in a one-horse carriage;
while in the last sat the purveyor of the feast, with a cask of
brandy in his arms.They drove rapidly past Nils and Arne, shouting
and singing down the hill; while behind them the breeze bore upwards,
through a cloud of dust, the sound of the violins, the cries, and the
rattling of the wheels, at first loud, then fainter and fainter, till
at last it died away in the distance.Nils remained standing
motionless till he heard a little rustling behind him; then he turned
round: it was Arne stealing forth from his hiding-place.he asked; but then he started back a little,
for Nils' face had an evil look.The boy stood silently, waiting for
an answer; but he got none; and at last, becoming impatient, he
ventured to ask, "Are we going now?"Nils was still standing
motionless, looking dreamily in the direction where the bridal train
had gone; then he collected himself, and walked homewards.Arne
followed, and once more began to shoot and to run after his arrows."Don't trample down the meadow," said Nils abruptly.The boy let the
arrow lie and came back; but soon he forgot the warning, and, while
the father once more stood still, he lay down to make somersaults."Don't trample down the meadow, I say," repeated Nils, seizing his
arm and snatching him up by it almost violently enough to sprain it.At the door Margit stood waiting for them.She had just come from the
cow-house, where it seemed she had been working hard, for her hair
was rough, her linen soiled, and her dress untidy; but she stood in
the doorway smiling."Red-side has calved," she said; "and never in
all my life did I see such a great calf.""I think you might make yourself a little tidy of a Sunday," said
Nils as he went past her into the room."Yes, now the work's done, there'll be time for dressing," answered
Margit, following him: and she began to dress, singing meanwhile.Margit now sang very well, though sometimes her voice was a little
hoarse."Leave off that screaming," said Nils, throwing himself upon the bed.Then the boy came bustling in, all out of breath."The calf, the calf's got red marks on each side and a spot on the
forehead, just like his mother."cried Nils, putting down one of his feet
from the bed, and stamping on the floor."The deuce is in that
bustling boy," he growled out, drawing up his foot again."You can see very well father's out of spirits to-day," the mother
said to Arne, by way of warning."Shouldn't you like some strong
coffee with treacle?"she then said, turning to Nils, trying to drive
away his ill-temper.Coffee with treacle had been a favorite drink
with the grandmother and Margit, and Arne liked it too.But Nils
never liked it, though he used to take it with the others."Shouldn't
you like some strong coffee with treacle?"Margit asked again, for he
did not answer the first time.Now, he raised himself on his elbows,
and cried in a loud, harsh voice, "Do you think I'll guzzle that
filthy stuff?"Margit was thunder-struck; and she went out, taking the boy with her.They had several things to do out-doors, and they did not come in
till supper-time; then Nils had gone.Arne was sent out into the
field to call him, but could not find him anywhere.They waited till
the supper was nearly cold; but Nils had not come even when it was
finished.Then Margit grew fidgety, sent Arne to bed, and sat down,
waiting."Where have you been,
dear?""That's no business of yours," he answered, seating himself slowly on
the bench.From that time he often went out into the parish; and he was always
drunk when he came back."I can't bear stopping at home with you," he
once said when he came in.She gently tried to plead her cause; but
he stamped on the floor, and bade her be silent.Was he drunk, then
it was her fault; was he wicked, that was her fault, too; had he
become a <DW36> and an unlucky man for all his life, then, again,
she and that cursed boy of hers were the cause of it."Why were you
always dangling after me?"Margit answered, "was it I that ran after
you?""Yes, that you did," he cried, raising himself; and, still
blubbering, he continued, "Now, at last, it has turned out just as
you would have it: I drag along here day after day--every day looking
on my own grave.But I might have lived in splendor with the first
girl in the parish; I might have travelled as far as the sun; if you
and that cursed boy of yours hadn't put yourselves in my way."Again she tried to defend herself: "It isn't the boy's fault, at any
rate.""Hold your tongue, or I'll strike you!"The next day, when he had slept himself sober, he felt ashamed, and
would especially be kind to the boy.But he was soon drunk again; and
then he beat Margit.At last he beat her almost every time he was
drunk; Arne then cried and fretted, and so he beat him, too; but
often he was so miserable afterwards that he felt obliged to go out
again and take some more spirits.At this time, too, he began once
more to set his mind on going to dancing-parties.He played at them
just as he used to do before his illness; and he took Arne with him
to carry the fiddle-case.At these parties the child saw and heard
much which was not good for him; and the mother often wept because he
was taken there: still she dared not say anything to the father about
it.But to the child she often imploringly said, with many caresses,
"Keep close to God, and don't learn anything wicked."But at the
dancing-parties there was very much to amuse him, while at home with
the mother there was very little; and so he turned more and more away
from her to the father: she saw it, but was silent.He learned many
songs at these parties, and he used to sing them to the father, who
felt amused, and laughed now and then at them.This flattered the boy
so much that he set himself to learn as many songs as he could; and
soon he found out what it was that the father liked, and that made
him laugh.When there was nothing of this kind in the songs, the boy
would himself put something in as well as he could; and thus he early
acquired facility in setting words to music.But lampoons and
disgusting stories about people who had risen to wealth and
influence, were the things which the father liked best, and which the
boy sang.The mother always wished him to go with her in the cow-house to tend
the cattle in the evening.He used to find all sorts of excuses to
avoid going; but it was of no use; she was resolved he should go.There she talked to him about God and good things, and generally
ended by pressing him to her heart, imploring him, with many tears,
not to become a bad man.She helped him, too, in his reading-lessons.He was extremely
quick in learning; and the father felt proud of him, and told
him--especially when he was drunk--that he had _his_ cleverness.At dancing-parties, when the father was drunk, he used often to ask
Arne to sing to the people; and then he would sing song after song,
amidst their loud laughter and applause.This pleased him even more
than it pleased his father; and at last he used to sing songs without
number.Some anxious mothers who heard this, came to Margit and told
her about it, because the subjects of the songs were not such as they
ought to have been.Then she called the boy to her side, and forbade
him, in the name of God and all that was good, to sing such songs any
more.And now it seemed to him that she was always opposed to what
gave him pleasure; and, for the first time in his life, he told the
father what she had said; and when he was again drunk she had to
suffer for it severely: till then he had not spoken of it.Then Arne
saw clearly how wrong a thing he had done, and in the depths of his
soul he asked God and her to forgive him; but he could not ask it in
words.She continued to show him the same kindness as before, and it
pierced his heart.Once, however, in spite of all, he again wronged
her.He had a talent for mimicking people, especially in their
speaking and singing; and one evening, while he was amusing the
father in this way, the mother entered, and, when she was going away,
the father took it into his head to ask him to mimic her.At first he
refused; but the father, who lay on the bed laughing till he shook,
insisted upon his doing it."She's gone," the boy thought, "and can't
hear me;" and he mimicked her singing, just as it was when her voice
was hoarse and obstructed by tears.The father laughed till the boy
grew quite frightened and at once left off.Then the mother came in
from the kitchen, looked at Arne long and mournfully, went over to
the shelf, took down a milk-dish and carried it away.He felt burning hot all over: she had heard it all.He jumped down
from the table where he had been sitting, went out, threw himself on
the ground, and wished to hide himself for ever in the earth.He
could not rest, and he rose and went farther from the house.Passing
by the barn, he there saw his mother sitting, making a new fine shirt
for him.It was her usual habit to sing a hymn while sewing: now,
however, she was silent.Then Arne could bear it no longer; he threw
himself on the grass at her feet, looked up in her face, and wept and
sobbed bitterly.Margit let fall her work, and took his head between
her hands.she said, putting her face down to his.He did not try
to say a word, but wept as he had never wept before."I knew you were
good at heart," she said, stroking his head."Mother, you mustn't refuse what I am now going to ask," were the
first words he was able to utter."You know I never do refuse you," answered she.He tried to stop his tears, and then, with his face still in her
lap, he stammered out, "Do sing a little for me, mother.""You know I can't do it," she said, in a low voice."Sing something for me, mother," implored the boy; "or I shall never
have courage to look you in the face again."She went on stroking his
hair, but was silent."Do sing, mother dear," he implored again; "or
I shall go far away, and never come back any more."Though he was now
almost fifteen years old, he lay there with his head in his mother's
lap, and she began to sing:

   "Merciful Father, take in thy care
      The child as he plays by the shore;
    Send him Thy Holy Spirit there,
      And leave him alone no more.Slipp'ry's the way, and high is the tide;
    Still if Thou keepest close by his side
    He never will drown, but live for Thee,
    And then at the last Thy heaven will see.Wondering where her child is astray,
      The mother stands at the cottage door,
    Calls him a hundred times i' the day,
      And fears he will come no more.But then she thinks, whatever betide,
    The Spirit of God will be his Guide,
    And Christ the blessed, his little Brother,
    Will carry him back to his longing mother."Arne lay still; a blessed peace came over
him, and under its soothing influence he slept.The last word he
heard distinctly was, "Christ;" it transported him into regions of
light; and he fancied that he listened to a chorus of voices, but his
mother's voice was clearer than all.Sweeter tones he had never
heard, and he prayed to be allowed to sing in like manner; and then
at once he began, gently and softly, and still more softly, until
his bliss became rapture, and then suddenly all disappeared.He
awoke, looked about him, listened attentively, but heard nothing save
the little rivulet which flowed past the barn with a low and constant
murmur.The mother was gone; but she had placed the half-made shirt
and his jacket under his head.When now the time of year came for the cattle to be sent into the
wood, Arne wished to go to tend them.But the father opposed him:
indeed, he had never gone before, though he was now in his fifteenth
year.But he pleaded so well, that his wish was at last complied
with; and so during the spring, summer, and autumn, he passed the
whole day alone in the wood, and only came home to sleep.He took his books up there, and read, carved letters in the bark of
the trees, thought, longed, and sang.But when in the evening he came
home and found the father often drunk and beating the mother, cursing
her and the whole parish, and saying how once he might have gone far
away, then a longing for travelling arose in the lad's mind.There
was no comfort for him at home; and his books made his thoughts
travel; nay, it seemed sometimes as if the very breeze bore them on
its wings far away.Then, about midsummer, he met with Christian, the Captain's eldest
son, who one day came to the wood with the servant boy, to catch the
horses, and to ride them home.He was a few years older than Arne,
light-hearted and jolly, restless in mind, but nevertheless strong in
purpose; he spoke fast and abruptly, and generally about two things
at once; shot birds in their flight; rode bare-backed horses;
went fly-fishing; and altogether seemed to Arne the paragon of
perfection.He, too, had set his mind upon travelling, and he talked
to Arne about foreign countries till they shone like fairy-lands.He
found out Arne's love for reading, and he carried up to him all the
books he had read himself; on Sundays he taught him geography from
maps: and during the whole of that summer Arne read till he became
pale and thin.Even when the winter came, he was permitted to read at home; partly
because he was going to be confirmed the next year, and partly
because he always knew how to manage with his father.He also began
to go to school; but while there it seemed to him he never got on so
well as when he shut his eyes and thought over the things in his
books at home: and he no longer had any companions among the boys of
the parish.The father's bodily infirmity, as well as his passion for drinking,
increased with his years; and he treated his wife worse and worse.And while Arne sat at home trying to amuse him, and often, merely to
keep peace for the mother, telling things which he now despised, a
hatred of his father grew up in his heart.But there he kept it
secretly, just as he kept his love for his mother.Even when he
happened to meet Christian, he said nothing to him about home
affairs; but all their talk ran upon their books and their intended
travels.But often when, after those wide roaming conversations, he
was returning home alone, thinking of what he perhaps would have to
see when he arrived there, he wept and prayed that God would take
care he might soon be allowed to go away.In the summer he and Christian were confirmed: and soon afterwards
the latter carried out his purpose of travelling.At last, he
prevailed upon his father to let him be a sailor; and he went far
away; first giving Arne his books, and promising to write often to
him.About this time a wish to make songs awoke again in his mind; and now
he no longer patched old songs, but made new ones for himself, and
said in them whatever most pained him.But soon his heart became too heavy to let him make songs any more.He lay sleepless whole nights, feeling that he could not bear to stay
at home any longer, and that he must go far away, find out Christian,
and--not say a word about it to any one.But when he thought of the
mother, and what would become of her, he could scarcely look her in
the face; and his love made him linger still.One evening when it was growing late, Arne sat reading: indeed, when
he felt more sad than usual he always took refuge in his books;
little understanding that they only increased his burden.The father
had gone to a wedding party, but was expected home that evening; the
mother, weary and afraid of him, had gone to bed.Then Arne was
startled by the sound of a heavy fall in the passage, and of
something hard pushing against the door.It was the father, just
coming home.he muttered; "come and help your father
to get up."Arne helped him up, and brought him to the bench; then
carried in the violin-case after him, and shut the door."Well, look
at me, you clever boy; I don't look very handsome now; Nils, the
tailor's no longer the man he used to be.One thing I--tell--you--you
shall never drink spirits; they're--the devil, the world, and the
flesh.... 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.'He sat silent for a while, and then sang in a tearful voice,

   "Merciful Lord, I come to Thee;
    Help, if there can be help for me;
    Though by the mire of sin defiled,
    I'm still Thine own dear ransomed child.""'Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof; but
speak the word only....'" He threw himself forward, hid his face in
his hands, and sobbed violently.Then, after lying thus a long while,
he said, word for word out of the Scriptures, just as he had learned
it more than twenty years ago, "'But he answered and said, I am not
sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.Then came she
and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.But he answered and said,
It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
from their master's table.'"Then he was silent, and his weeping became subdued and calm.The mother had been long awake, without looking up; but now when she
heard him weeping thus like one who is saved, she raised herself on
her elbows, and gazed earnestly at him.But scarcely did Nils perceive her before he called out, "Are you
looking up, you ugly vixen!I suppose you would like to see what a
state you have brought me to.... He rose;
and she hid herself under the fur coverlet."Nay, don't hide, I'm
sure to find you," he said, stretching out his right hand and
fumbling with his forefinger on the bed-clothes, "Tickle, tickle," he
said, turning aside the fur coverlet, and putting his forefinger on
her throat."How shrivelled and thin you've become already, there's no depth of
flesh here!"She writhed beneath his touch, and seized his hand with
both hers, but could not free herself.How she wriggles, the ugly thing!Can't
you scream to make believe I am beating you?I only
want to take away your breath."Arne said once more, running to the corner of the room, and
snatching up an axe which stood there."Is it only out of perverseness, you don't scream?you had better
beware; for I've taken such a strange fancy into my head.Now I think I shall soon get rid of that screaming of yours."Arne shouted, rushing towards him with the axe uplifted.But before Arne could reach him, he started up with a piercing cry,
laid his hand upon his heart, and fell heavily down.Arne stood as if rooted in the ground, and gradually lowered the axe.He grew dizzy and bewildered, and scarcely knew where he was.Then
the mother began to move to and fro in the bed, and to breathe
heavily, as if oppressed by some great weight lying upon her.Arne
saw that she needed help; but yet he felt unable to render it.At
last she raised herself a little, and saw the father lying stretched
on the floor, and Arne standing beside him with the axe."Merciful Lord, what have you done?"she cried, springing out of the
bed, putting on her skirt and coming nearer."He fell down himself," said Arne, at last regaining power to speak."Arne, Arne, I don't believe you," said the mother in a stern
reproachful voice: "now Jesus help you!"And she threw herself upon
the dead man with loud wailing.But the boy awoke from his stupor, dropped the axe and fell down on
his knees: "As true as I hope for mercy from God, I've not done it.I
almost thought of doing it; I was so bewildered; but then he fell
down himself; and here I've been standing ever since."The mother looked at him, and believed him."Then our Lord has been
here Himself," she said quietly, sitting down on the floor and gazing
before her.Nils lay quite stiff, with open eyes and mouth, and hands drawn near
together, as though he had at the last moment tried to fold them, but
had been unable to do so.The first thing the mother now did was to
fold them."Let us look closer at him," she said then, going over to
the fireplace, where the fire was almost out.Arne followed her, for
he felt afraid of standing alone.She gave him a lighted fir-splinter
to hold; then she once more went over to the dead body and stood by
one side of it, while the son stood at the other, letting the light
fall upon it."Yes, he's quite gone," she said; and then, after a little while, she
continued, "and gone in an evil hour, I'm afraid."Arne's hands trembled so much that the burning ashes of the splinter
fell upon the father's clothes and set them on fire; but the boy did
not perceive it, neither did the mother at first, for she was
weeping.But soon she became aware of it through the bad smell, and
she cried out in fear.When now the boy looked, it seemed to him as
though the father himself was burning, and he dropped the splinter
upon him, sinking down in a swoon.Up and down, and round and round,
the room moved with him; the table moved, the bed moved; the axe
hewed; the father rose and came to him; and then all of them came
rolling upon him.Then he felt as if a soft cooling breeze passed
over his face; and he cried out and awoke.The first thing he did was
to look at the father, to assure himself that he still lay quietly.And a feeling of inexpressible happiness came over the boy's mind
when he saw that the father was dead--really dead; and he rose as
though he were entering upon a new life.The mother had extinguished the burning clothes, and began to lay out
the body.She made the bed, and then said to Arne, "Take hold of your
father, you're so strong, and help me to lay him nicely."They laid
him on the bed, and Margit shut his eyes and mouth, stretched his
limbs, and folded his hands once more.It was only a little past
midnight, and they had to stay there with him till morning.Arne made
a good fire, and the mother sat down by it.While sitting there, she
looked back upon the many miserable days she had passed with Nils,
and she thanked God for taking him away."But still I had some happy
days with him, too," she said after a while.Arne took a seat opposite her; and, turning to him, she went on, "And
to think that he should have such an end as this!even if he has not
lived as he ought, truly he has suffered for it."She wept, looked
over to the dead man, and continued, "But now God grant I may be
repaid for all I have gone through with him.Arne, you must remember
it was for your sake I suffered it all.""Therefore, you must never leave me," she sobbed; "you are now my
only comfort.""I never will leave you; that I promise before God," the boy said, as
earnestly as if he had thought of saying it for years.He felt a
longing to go over to her; yet he could not.She grew calmer, and, looking kindly over at the dead man, she said,
"After all, there was a great deal of good in him; but the world
dealt hardly by him.... But now he's gone to our Lord, and He'll be
kinder to him, I'm sure."Then, as if she had been following out this
thought within herself, she added, "We must pray for him.If I could,
I would sing over him; but you, Arne, have such a fine voice, you
must go and sing to your father."Arne fetched the hymn-book and lighted a fir-splinter; and, holding
it in one hand and the book in the other, he went to the head of the
bed and sang in a clear voice Kingo's 127th hymn:

   "Regard us again in mercy, O God!And turn Thou aside Thy terrible rod,
    That now in Thy wrath laid on us we see
    To chasten us sore for sin against Thee.""HE HAD IN HIS MIND A SONG."Yet he continued tending the
cattle upon the mountains in the summer, while in the winter he
remained at home studying.About this time the clergyman sent a message, asking him to become
the parish schoolmaster, and saying his gifts and knowledge might
thus be made useful to his neighbors.Arne sent no answer; but the
next day, while he was driving his flock, he made the following
verses:

   "O, my pet lamb, lift your head,
    Though a stony path you tread,
    Over all the lonely fells,
    Only follow still your bells.O, my pet lamb, walk with care;
    Lest you spoil your wool, beware:
    Mother now must soon be sewing
    New lamb-skins, for summer's going.O, my pet lamb, try to grow
    Fat and fine where'er you go:
    Know you not, my little sweeting,
    A spring-lamb is dainty eating?"One day he happened to overhear a conversation between his mother and
the late owner of the place: they were at odds about the horse of
which they were joint-owners."I must wait and hear what Arne says,"
interposed the mother.the man exclaimed; "he would
like the horse to ramble about in the wood, just as he does himself."Then the mother became silent, though before she had been pleading
her cause well.That his mother had to bear people's jeers on
his account, never before occurred to him, and, "Perhaps she had
borne many," he thought."But why had she not told him of it?"He turned the matter over, and then it came into his mind that the
mother scarcely ever talked to him at all.But, then, he scarcely
ever talked to her either.But, after all, whom did he talk much to?Often on Sundays, when he was sitting quietly at home, he would have
liked to read the sermon to his mother, whose eyes were weak, for she
had wept too much in her time.Often, too,
on weekdays, when she was sitting down, and he thought the time might
hang heavy, he would have liked to offer to read some of his own
books to her: still, he did not."Well, never mind," thought he: "I'll soon leave off tending the
cattle on the mountains; and then I'll be more with mother."He let
this resolve ripen within him for several days: meanwhile he drove
his cattle far about in the wood, and made the following verses:

   "The vale is full of trouble, but here sweet Peace may reign;
    Within this quiet forest no bailiffs may distrain;
    None fight, like all in the vale, in the Blessed Church's name;
    But still if a church were here, perhaps 'twould be just the same.Here all are at peace--true, the hawk is rather unkind;
    I fear he is looking now the plumpest sparrow to find;
    I fear yon eagle is coming to rob the kid of his breath;
    But still if he lived very long he might be tired to death.The woodman fells one tree, and another rots away:
    The red fox killed the lambkin at sunset yesterday;
    But the wolf killed the fox; and the wolf, too, had to die,
    For Arne shot him down to-day before the dew was dry.Back I'll go to the valley: the forest is just as bad--
    I must take heed, however, or thinking will drive me mad--
    I saw a boy in my dreams, though where I cannot tell--
    But I know he had killed his father, and I think it was in hell."Then he went home and told the mother she might send for a lad to
tend the cattle on the mountains; and that he would himself manage
the farm: and so it was arranged.But the mother was constantly
hovering about him, warning him not to work too hard.Then, too, she
used to get him such nice meals that he often felt quite ashamed to
take them; yet he said nothing.He had in his mind a song having for its burden, "Over the mountains
high;" but he never could complete it, principally because he always
tried to bring the burden in every alternate line; so afterwards he
gave this up.But several of his songs became known, and were much liked; and many
people, especially those who had known him from his childhood, were
fond of talking to him.But he was shy to all whom he did not know,
and he thought ill of them, mainly because he fancied they thought
ill of him.In the next field to his own worked a middle-aged man named
Opplands-Knut, who used sometimes to sing, but always the same song.After Arne had heard him singing it for several months, he thought he
would ask him whether he did not know any others.Then after a few more days, when he was again singing his
song, Arne asked him, "How came you to learn that one song?"it happened thus----" and then he said no more.Arne went away from him straight indoors; and there he found his
mother weeping; a thing he had not seen her do ever since the
father's death.He turned back again, just as though he did not
notice it; but he felt the mother was looking sorrowfully after him,
and he was obliged to stop.She did not answer, and
all was silent in the room.Then his words came back to him again,
and he felt they had not been spoken so kindly as they ought; and
once more, in a gentler tone, he asked, "What are you crying for,
mother?""Ah, I hardly know," she said, weeping still more.He stood silent a
while; but at last mustered courage to say, "Still, there must be
some reason why you are crying."Again there was silence; but although the mother had not said one
word of blame, he felt he was very guilty towards her."Well it just
came over me," she said after a while; and in a few moments she
added, "but really, I'm very happy;" and then she began weeping
again.Arne hurried out, away to the ravine; and while he sat there looking
into it, he, too, began weeping."If I only knew what I am crying
for," he said.Then he heard Opplands-Knut singing in the fields above him:

   "Ingerid Sletten of Willow-pool
      Had no costly trinkets to wear;
      But a cap she had that was far more fair,
    Although 'twas only of wool.It had no trimming, and now was old;
      But her mother, who long had gone,
      Had given it her, and so it shone
    To Ingerid more than gold.For twenty years she laid it aside,
      That it might not be worn away:
      'My cap I'll wear on that blissful day
    When I shall become a bride.'For thirty years she laid it aside
      Lest the colors might fade away:
      'My cap I'll wear when to God I pray,
    A happy and grateful bride.'For forty years she laid it aside,
      Still holding her mother as dear:
      'My little cap, I certainly fear
    I never shall be a bride.'She went to look for the cap one day
      In the chest where it long had lain;
      But, ah!her looking was all in vain:
    The cap had mouldered away."Arne listened, and the words seemed to him like music playing far
away over the mountains.He went up to Knut and asked him, "Have you
a mother?""Ah, yes; it's long since.""You haven't many, I dare say, who love you?""Haven't you any at all then who love you?""Ah, no; I haven't any."But Arne walked away with his heart so full of love to his mother
that it seemed as if it would burst; and all around him grew bright.He felt he must go in again, if only for the sake of looking at her.As he walked on the thought struck him, "What if I were to lose her?""Almighty God, what would then become of me?"Then he felt as if some dreadful accident was happening at home, and
he hurried onwards, cold drops bursting from his brow, and his feet
hardly touching the ground.He threw open the outer door, and came at
once into an atmosphere of peace.Then he gently opened the door of
the inner room.The mother had gone to bed, and lay sleeping as
calmly as a child, with the moonbeams shining full on her face.A few days after, the mother and son agreed on going together to the
wedding of some relations in one of the neighboring places.The
mother had not been to a party ever since she was a girl; and both
she and Arne knew but very little of the people living around, save
their names.Arne felt uncomfortable at this party, however, for he fancied
everybody was staring at him: and once, as he was passing through the
passage, he believed he heard something said about him, the mere
thought of which made every drop of blood rush into his face.He kept going about looking after the man who had said it, and at
last he took a seat next him.When they were at dinner, the man said, "Well, now, I shall tell you
a story which proves nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't
one day be brought to light;" and Arne fancied he looked at him all
the time he was saying this.He was an ugly-looking man, with scanty
red hair, hanging about a wide, round forehead, small, deep-set eyes,
a little snub-nose, and a large mouth, with pale out-turned lips,
which showed both his gums when he laughed.His hands were resting on
the table; they were large and coarse, but the wrists were slender.He had a fierce look; and he spoke quickly, but with difficulty.The
people called him "Bragger;" and Arne knew that in bygone days, Nils,
the tailor, had treated him badly."Yes," continued the man, "there is indeed, a great deal of sin in
the world; and it sits nearer to us than we think.... But never mind;
I'll tell you now of a foul deed.Those of you who are old will
remember Alf--Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say:
and he has left that saying behind him.When he had struck a
bargain--and what a fellow for trade he was!--he would take up his
bundle, and say, 'I'll call again.'A devil of a fellow, proud
fellow, brave fellow, was he, Alf, the pedlar!"Well he and Big Lazy-bones, Big Lazy-bones--well, you know Big
Lazy-bones?--big he was, and lazy he was, too.He took a fancy to a
coal-black horse that Alf, the pedlar, used to drive, and had trained
to hop like a summer frog.And almost before Big Lazy-bones knew what
he was about, he paid fifty dollars for this horse!Then Big
Lazy-bones, tall as he was, got into a carriage, meaning to drive
about like a king with his fifty-dollar-horse; but, though he whipped
and swore like a devil, the horse kept running against all the doors
and windows; for it was stone-blind!"Afterwards, whenever Alf and Big Lazy-bones came across each other,
they used to quarrel and fight about this horse like two dogs.Big
Lazy-bones said he would have his money back; but he could not get a
farthing of it: and Alf drubbed him till the bristles flew.'I'll
call again,' said Alf.A devil of a fellow, proud fellow, brave
fellow that Alf--Alf, the pedlar!"Well, after that some years passed away without his being seen
again."Then, in about ten years or so, a call for him was published on the
church-hill,[2] for a great fortune had been left him.'Ah,' said he, 'I well knew it must be
money, and not men, that called out for Alf, the pedlar.'[2] In Norway, certain public announcements are made before the
 church door on Sundays after service.--Translators."Now, there was a good deal of talk one way and another about Alf;
and at last it seemed to be pretty clearly made out that he had been
seen for the last time on _this_ side of the ledge, and not on the
other.Well, you remember the road over the ledge--the old road?"Of late, Big Lazy-bones had got quite a great man, and he owned both
houses and land.Then, too, he had taken to being religious; and
that, everybody knew, he didn't take to for nothing--nobody does."Just at this time the road over the ledge had to be altered.Folks
in bygone days had a great fancy for going straight onwards; and so
the old road ran straight over the ledge; but now-a-days we like to
have things smooth and easy; and so the new road was made to run down
along the river.While they were making it, there was digging and
mining enough to bring down the whole mountain about their ears; and
the magistrates and all the officers who have to do with that sort of
thing were there.One day while the men were digging deep in the
stony ground, one of them took up something which he thought was a
stone; but it turned out to be the bones of a man's hand instead; and
a wonderfully strong hand it seemed to be, for the man who got it
fell flat down directly.The magistrate
was just strolling about round there, and they fetched him to the
place; and then all the bones belonging to a whole man were dug out.The Doctor, too, was fetched; and he put them all together so
cleverly that nothing was wanting but the flesh.And then it struck
some of the people that the skeleton was just about the same size
and make as Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say."And then it struck somebody else, that it was a very queer thing a
dead hand should have made a great fellow like Big Lazy-bones fall
flat down like that: and the magistrate accused him straight of
having had more to do with that dead hand than he ought--of course,
when nobody else was by.But then Big Lazy-bones foreswore it with
such fearful oaths that the magistrate turned quite giddy.'Well,'
said the magistrate, 'if you didn't do it, I dare say you're a
fellow, now, who would not mind sleeping with the skeleton
to-night?'--'No; I shouldn't mind a bit,--not I,' said Big
Lazy-bones.So the Doctor tied the joints of the skeleton together,
and laid it in one of the beds in the barracks; and put another bed
close by it for Big Lazy-bones.The magistrate wrapped himself in his
cloak, and lay down close to the door outside.When night came on,
and Big Lazy-bones had to go in to his bedfellow, the door shut
behind him as though of itself, and he stood in the dark.But then
Big Lazy-bones set off singing psalms, for he had a mighty voice.'May be the bells were never tolled for him,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then he began praying out loud, as earnestly as ever he
could.asked the magistrate from outside the
wall.'No doubt, he has been a great sinner,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then a time after, all got so still that the magistrate
might have gone to sleep.But then came a shrieking that made the
very barracks shake: 'I'll call again!'--Then came a hellish noise
and crash: 'Out with that fifty dollars of mine!'roared Big
Lazy-bones: and the shrieking and crashing came again.Then the
magistrate burst open the door; the people rushed in with poles and
firebrands; and there lay Big Lazy-bones on the floor, with the
skeleton on the top of him."There was a deep silence all round the table.At last a man who was
lighting his clay-pipe said, "Didn't he go mad from that very time?"Arne fancied everybody was looking at him, and he dared not raise his
eyes."I say, as I said before," continued the man who had told the
tale, "nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't one day be
brought to light.""Well, now I'll tell you about a son who beat his own father," said a
fair stout man with a round face.Arne no longer knew where he was
sitting."This son was a great fellow, almost a giant, belonging to a tall
family in Hardanger; and he was always at odds with somebody or
other.He and his father were always quarrelling about the yearly
allowance; and so he had no peace either at home or out."This made him grow more and more wicked; and the father persecuted
him.'I won't be put down by anybody,' the son said.'Yes, you'll be
put down by me so long as I live,' the father answered.'If you don't
hold your tongue,' said the son, rising, 'I'll strike you.'--'Well,
do if you dare; and never in this world will you have luck again,'
answered the father, rising also.--'Do you mean to say that?'said
the son; and he rushed upon him and knocked him down.But the father
didn't try to help himself: he folded his arms and let the son do
just as he liked with him.Then he knocked him about, rolled him over
and over, and dragged him towards the door by his white hair.'I'll
have peace in my own house, at any rate,' said he.But when they had
come to the door, the father raised himself a little and cried out,
'Not beyond the door, for so far I dragged my own father.'The son
didn't heed it, but dragged the old man's head over the threshold.And the old man rose, knocked down the
son and beat him as one would beat a child.""Ah, that's a sad story," several said.Then Arne fancied he heard
some one saying, "It's a wicked thing to strike one's father;" and he
rose, turning deadly pale."Now I'll tell _you_ something," he said; but he hardly knew what he
was going to say: words seemed flying around him like large
snowflakes."I'll catch them at random," he said and began:--

"A troll once met a lad walking along the road weeping.'Whom are
you most afraid of?'asked the troll, 'yourself or others?'Now,
the boy was weeping because he had dreamed last night he had killed
his wicked father; and so he answered, 'I'm most afraid of
myself.'--'Then fear yourself no longer, and never weep again; for
henceforward you shall only have strife with others.'But the first whom the lad met jeered at him; and so
the lad jeered at him again.The second he met beat him; and so he
beat him again.The third he met tried to kill him; and so the lad
killed him.Then all the people spoke ill of the lad; and so he spoke
ill again of all the people.They shut the doors against him, and
kept all their things away from him; so he stole what he wanted; and
he even took his night's rest by stealth.As now they wouldn't let
him come to do anything good, he only did what was bad; and all that
was bad in other people, they let him suffer for.And the people in
the place wept because of the mischief done by the lad; but he did
not weep himself, for he could not.Then all the people met together
and said, 'Let's go and drown him, for with him we drown all the
evil that is in the place.'So they drowned him forthwith; but
afterwards they thought the well where he was drowned gave forth a
mighty odor."The lad himself didn't at all know he had done anything wrong; and
so after his death he came drifting in to our Lord.There, sitting on
a bench, he saw his father, whom he had not killed, after all; and
opposite the father, on another bench, sat the one whom he had jeered
at, the one he had beaten, the one he had killed, and all those whom
he had stolen from, and those whom he had otherwise wronged."'Whom are you afraid of,' our Lord asked, 'of your father, or of
those on the long bench?'"'Sit down then by your father,' said our Lord; and the lad went to
sit down.But then the father fell down from the bench with a large
axe-cut in his neck.In his seat, came one in the likeness of the lad
himself, but with a thin and ghastly pale face; another with a
drunkard's face, matted hair, and drooping limbs; and one more with
an insane face, torn clothes, and frightful laughter."'So it might have happened to you,' said our Lord.said the boy, catching hold of the Lord's coat."Then both the benches fell down from heaven; but the boy remained
standing near the Lord rejoicing."'Remember this when you awake,' said our Lord; and the boy awoke."The boy who dreamed so is I; those who tempted him by thinking him
bad are you.I am no longer afraid of myself, but I am afraid of you.Do not force me to evil; for it is uncertain if I get hold of the
Lord's coat."He ran out: the men looked at each other.THE SOLILOQUY IN THE BARN.On the evening of the day after this, Arne was lying in a barn
belonging to the same house.For the first time in his life he had
become drunk, and he had been lying there for the last twenty-four
hours.Now he sat up, resting upon his elbows, and talked with
himself:

"... Everything I look at turns to cowardice.It was cowardice that
hindered me from running away while a boy; cowardice that made me
listen to father more than to mother; cowardice also made me sing
the wicked songs to him.I began tending the cattle through
cowardice,--to read--well, that, too, was through cowardice: I
wished to get away from myself.When, though a grown up lad, yet
I didn't help mother against father--cowardice; that I didn't that
night--ugh!--cowardice!I might perhaps have waited till she was
killed!... I couldn't bear to stay at home afterwards--cowardice;
still I didn't go away--cowardice; I did nothing, I tended cattle...
cowardice.'Tis true I promised mother to stay at home; still I
should have been cowardly enough to break my promise if I hadn't been
afraid of mixing among people.For I'm afraid of people, mainly
because I think they see how bad I am; and because I'm afraid of
them, I speak ill of them--a curse upon my cowardice!I'm afraid of thinking bravely about my own
affairs, and so I turn aside and think about other people's; and
making verses is just that."I've cause enough to weep till the hills turned to lakes, but
instead of that I say to myself, 'Hush, hush,' and begin rocking.And
even my songs are cowardly; for if they were bold they would be
better.I'm afraid of strong thoughts; afraid of anything that's
strong; and if ever I rise into it, it's in a passion, and passion is
cowardice.I'm more clever and know more than I seem; I'm better than
my words, but my cowardice makes me afraid of showing myself in my
true colors.I drank that spirits through cowardice;
I wanted to deaden my pain--shame upon me!I felt miserable all
the while I was drinking it, yet I drank; drank my father's
heart's-blood, and still I drank!In fact there's no end to my
cowardice; and the most cowardly thing is, that I can sit and tell
myself all this!I am a vast deal too cowardly for that.Then, too, I believe a little in God... yes, I believe in God.I
would fain go to Him; but cowardice keeps me from going: it would be
such a great change that a coward shrinks from it.But if I were to
put forth what power I have?Thou wouldst
cure me in such a way as my milky spirit can bear; wouldst lead me
gently; for I have no bones in me, nor even gristle--nothing but
jelly.If I tried... with good, gentle books,--I'm afraid of the
strong ones--; with pleasant tales, stories, all that is mild, and
then a sermon every Sunday, and a prayer every evening.If I tried to
clear a field within me for religion; and worked in good earnest, for
one cannot sow in laziness.If I tried; dear mild God of my
childhood, if I tried!"But then the barn-door was opened, and the mother came rushing across
the floor.Her face was deadly pale, though the perspiration dropped
from it like great tears.For the last twenty-four hours she had
been rushing hither and thither, seeking her son, calling his name,
and scarcely pausing even to listen, until now when he answered from
the barn.Then she gave a loud cry, jumped upon the hay-mow more
lightly than a boy, and threw herself upon Arne's breast....

... "Arne, Arne are you here?At last I've found you; I've been
looking for you ever since yesterday; I've been looking for you all
night long!I saw they worried you, and I wanted to
come to speak to you and comfort you, but really I'm always afraid!"... "Arne, I saw you drinking spirits!Almighty God, may I never see
it again!It was some minutes
before she was able to speak again."Christ have mercy upon you, my
boy, I saw you drinking spirits!... You were gone all at once, drunk
and crushed by grief as you were!I ran all over the place; I went
far into the fields; but I couldn't find you: I looked in every
copse; I questioned everybody; I came here, too; but you didn't
answer.... Arne, Arne, I went along the river; but it seemed nowhere
to be deep enough...." She pressed herself closer to him."Then it came into my mind all at once that you might have gone home;
and I'm sure I was only a quarter of an hour going there.I opened
the outer-door and looked in every room; and then, for the first
time, I remembered that the house had been locked up, and I myself
had the key; and that you could not have come in, after all.Arne,
last night I looked all along both sides of the road: I dared not go
to the edge of the ravine.... I don't know how it was I came here
again; nobody told me; it must have been the Lord himself who put it
into my mind that you might be here!"She paused and lay for a while with her head upon his breast."Arne, you'll never drink spirits again, I'm sure?""No; you may be sure I never will.""I believe they were very hard upon you?"No; it was I who was _cowardly_," he answered, laying a great stress
upon the word."I can't understand how they could behave badly to you.But, tell me,
what did they do?you never will tell me anything;" and once more she
began weeping."But you never tell me anything, either," he said in a low gentle
voice."Yet you're the most in fault, Arne: I've been so long used to
be silent through your father; you ought to have led me on a
little.--Good Lord!we've only each other; and we've suffered so
much together.""Well, we must try to manage better," Arne whispered.... "Next Sunday I'll read the sermon to you.""I've greatly sinned against you; I've done something very wrong.""Indeed, I have; but I couldn't help doing it."But I'm sure you've never done anything wrong to me.""Indeed, I have: and my very love to you made me do it.But you must
forgive me; will you?""And then another time I'll tell you all about it... but you must
forgive me!""And don't you see the reason why I couldn't talk much to you was,
that I had this on my mind?"Pray don't talk so, mother!""Well, I'm glad I've said what I have.""And, mother, we'll talk more together, we two.""Yes, that we will; and then you'll read the sermon to me?""I think we both had better go home now.""Yes; your father once lay weeping in this barn.""You're looking all round, Arne?""It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I strolled to the wood, and down I lay,
      And rocked what came in my mind:
    But there the emmets crawled on the ground,
    And wasps and gnats were stinging around.'Won't you go out-doors this fine day, dear?'said mother, as she sat
in the porch, spinning.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I went in the birk, and down I lay,
      And sang what came in my mind:
    But snakes crept out to bask in the sun--
    Snakes five feet long, so, away I run.'In such beautiful weather one may go barefoot,' said mother, taking
off her stockings.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not abide;
    So I went in a boat, and down I lay,
      And floated away with the tide:
    But the sun-beams burned till my nose was sore;
    So I turned my boat again to the shore.'This is, indeed, good weather to dry the hay,' said mother, putting
her rake into a swath.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      In the house I could not be;
    And so from the heat I climbed away
      In the boughs of a shady tree:
    But caterpillars dropped on my face,
    So down I jumped and ran from the place.'Well, if the cow doesn't get on to-day, she never will get on,' said
mother, glancing up towards the <DW72>.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not remain:
    And so for quiet I rowed away
      To the waterfall amain:
    But there I drowned while bright was the sky:
    If you made this, it cannot be I.'Only three more such sunny days, and we shall get in all the hay,'
said mother, as she went to make my bed."Arne when a child had not cared much for fairy-tales; but now he
began to love them, and they led him to the sagas and old ballads.He
also read sermons and other religious books; and he was gentle and
kind to all around him.But in his mind arose a strange deep longing:
he made no more songs; but walked often alone, not knowing what was
within him.Many of the places around, which formerly he had not even noticed,
now appeared to him wondrously beautiful.At the time he and his
schoolfellows had to go to the Clergyman to be prepared for
confirmation, they used to play near a lake lying just below the
parsonage, and called the Swart-water because it lay deep and dark
between the mountains.He now often thought of this place; and one
evening he went thither.He sat down behind a grove close to the parsonage, which was built on
a steep hill-side, rising high above till it became a mountain.High
mountains rose likewise on the opposite shore, so that broad deep
shadows fell upon both sides of the lake, but in the middle ran a
stripe of bright silvery water.It was a calm evening near sunset,
and not a sound was heard save the tinkling of the cattle-bells from
the opposite shore.Arne at first did not look straight before him,
but downwards along the lake, where the sun was sprinkling burning
red ere it sank to rest.There, at the end, the mountains gave way,
and between them lay a long low valley, against which the lake beat;
but they seemed to run gradually towards each other, and to hold the
valley in a great swing.Houses lay thickly scattered all along, the
smoke rose and curled away, the fields lay green and reeking, and
boats laden with hay were anchored by the shore.Arne saw many people
going to and fro, but he heard no noise.Thence his eye went along
the shore towards God's dark wood upon the mountain-sides.Through
it, man had made his way, and its course was indicated by a winding
stripe of dust.This, Arne's eye followed to opposite where he was
sitting: there, the wood ended, the mountains opened, and houses lay
scattered all over the valley.They were nearer and looked larger
than those in the other valley; and they were red-painted, and their
large windows glowed in the sunbeams.The fields and meadows stood in
strong light, and the smallest child playing in them was clearly
seen; glittering white sands lay dry upon the shore, and some dogs
and puppies were running there.But suddenly all became sunless and
gloomy: the houses looked dark red, the meadows dull green, the sand
greyish white, and the children little clumps: a cloud of mist had
risen over the mountains, taking away the sunlight.Arne looked down
into the water, and there he found all once more: the fields lay
rocking, the wood silently drew near, the houses stood looking down,
the doors were open, and children went out and in.Fairy-tales and
childish things came rushing into his mind, as little fishes come to
a bait, swim away, come once more and play round, and again swim
away."Let's sit down here till your mother comes; I suppose the
Clergyman's lady will have finished sometime or other."Arne was
startled: some one had been sitting a little way behind him."If I might but stay this one night more," said an imploring voice,
half smothered by tears: it seemed to be that of a girl not quite
grown up."Now don't cry any more; it's wrong to cry because you're going home
to your mother," was slowly said by a gentle voice, which was
evidently that of a man."It's not that, I am crying for.""Because I shall not live any longer with Mathilde."This was the name of the Clergyman's only daughter; and Arne
remembered that a peasant-girl had been brought up with her."Still, that couldn't go on for ever.""Well, but only one day more father, dear!""No, it's better we take you home now; perhaps, indeed, it's already
too late.""You were born a peasant, and a peasant you shall be; we can't afford
to keep a lady.""But I might remain a peasant all the same if I stayed there.""I've always worn my peasant's dress.""Clothes have nothing to do with it.""I've spun, and woven, and done cooking.""I can speak just as you and mother speak.""Well, then, I really don't know what it is," the girl said,
laughing."Time will show; but I'm afraid you've already got too many
thoughts."so you always say; I have no thoughts;" and she
wept."Ah, you're a wind-mill, that you are.""No; but now _I_ say it."Now the girl laughed; but after a while she said gravely, "It's wrong
of you to say I'm nothing.""Dear me, when you said so yourself!""Nay; I won't be nothing."Again she laughed; but after a while she said in a sad tone, "The
Clergyman never used to make a fool of me in this way.""No; but he _did_ make a fool of you."well, you've never been so kind to me as he was.""No; and if I had I should have spoiled you.""Well, sour milk can never become sweet.""It may when it is boiled to whey.""Such a long-winded woman as that Clergyman's lady, I never met with
in all my live-long days," interposed a sharp quick voice."Now, make
haste, Baard; get up and push off the boat, or we sha'n't get home
to-night.The lady wished me to take care that Eli's feet were kept
dry.Dear me, she must attend to that herself!Then she said Eli must
take a walk every morning for the sake of her health!Well, get up, Baard, and push off the boat;
I have to make the dough this evening.""The chest hasn't come yet," he said, without rising."But the chest isn't to come; it's to be left there till next Sunday.Well, Eli, get up; take your bundle, and come on.Away she went, followed by the girl.Arne then heard the same voice say from the shore
below."Have you looked after the plug in the boat?""Yes, it's put in;" and then Arne heard her drive it in with a scoop."But do get up, Baard; I suppose we're not going to stay here all
night?"But bless you, dear, haven't I told you it's to be left there till
next Sunday?""Here it comes," Baard said, as the rattling of a cart was heard."Why, I said it was to be left till next Sunday.""I said we were to take it with us."Away went the wife to the cart, and carried the bundle and other
small things down into the boat.Then Baard rose, went up, and took
down the chest himself.But a girl with streaming hair, and a straw bonnet came running after
the cart: it was the Clergyman's daughter."Mathilde, Mathilde," was answered; and the two girls ran towards
each other.They met on the hill, embraced each other and wept.Then
Mathilde took out something which she had set down on the grass: it
was a bird in a cage."You shall have Narrifas," she said; "mamma wishes you to have it
too; you shall have Narrifas... you really shall--and then you'll
think of me--and very often row over to me;" and again they wept
much.Arne heard the mother
say from the shore below."But I'll go with you," said Mathilde.and, with their arms round each other's neck, they ran
down to the landing-place.In a few minutes Arne saw the boat on the water, Eli standing high in
the stern, holding the bird-cage, and waving her hand; while Mathilde
sat alone on the stones of the landing-place weeping.She remained sitting there watching the boat as long as it was on the
water; and so did Arne.The distance across the lake to the red
houses was but short; the boat soon passed into the dark shadows, and
he saw it come ashore.Then he saw in the water the reflections of
the three who had just landed, and in it he followed them on their
way to the red houses till they reached the finest of them; there he
saw them go in; the mother first, next, the father, and last, the
daughter.But soon the daughter came out again, and seated herself
before the storehouse; perhaps to look across to the parsonage, over
which the sun was laying its last rays.But Mathilde had already
gone, and it was only Arne who was sitting there looking at Eli in
the water."I wonder whether she sees me," he thought....

He rose and went away.The sun had set, but the summer night was
light and the sky clear blue.The mist from the lake and the valleys
rose, and lay along the mountain-sides, but their peaks were left
clear, and stood looking over to each other.He went higher: the
water lay black and deep below; the distant valley shortened and drew
nearer the lake; the mountains came nearer the eye and gathered in
clumps; the sky itself was lower; and all things became friendly and
familiar."Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
            Her lover to meet.He sang till it sounded afar away,
            'Good-day, good-day,'
    While blithesome birds were singing on every blooming spray.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."She wove him a wreath of corn-flowers blue:
            'Mine eyes so true.'He took it, but soon away it was flung:
            'Farewell!'he sung;
    And still with merry singing across the fields he sprung.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a chain: 'Oh keep it with care;
            'Tis made of my hair.'She yielded him then, in an hour of bliss,
            Her pure first kiss;
    But he blushed as deeply as she the while her lips met his
            On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath with a lily-band:
            'My true right hand.'She wove him another with roses aglow:
            'My left hand now.'He took them gently from her, but blushes dyed his brow.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath of all flowers round:
            'All I have found.'She wept, but she gathered and wove on still:
            'Take all you will.'Without a word he took it, and fled across the hill.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on bewildered and out of breath:
            'My bridal wreath.'She wove till her fingers aweary had grown:
            'Now put it on:'
    But when she turned to see him, she found that he had gone.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on in haste, as for life or death,
            Her bridal wreath;
        But the Midsummer sun no longer shone,
            And the flowers were gone;
    But though she had no flowers, wild fancy still wove on.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."Arne had of late been happier, both when at home and when out among
people.In the winter, when he had not work enough on his own place,
he went out in the parish and did carpentry; but every Saturday night
he came home to the mother; and went with her to church on Sunday, or
read the sermon to her; and then returned in the evening to his place
of work.But soon, through going more among people, his wish to
travel awoke within him again; and just after his merriest moods, he
would often lie trying to finish his song, "Over the mountains high,"
and altering it for about the twentieth time.He often thought of
Christian, who seemed to have so utterly forgotten him, and who, in
spite of his promise, had not sent him even a single letter.Once,
the remembrance of Christian came upon him so powerfully that he
thoughtlessly spoke of him to the mother; she gave no answer, but
turned away and went out.There was living in the parish a jolly man named Ejnar Aasen.When he
was twenty years old he broke his leg, and from that time he had
walked with the support of a stick; but wherever he appeared limping
along on that stick, there was always merriment going on.The man was
rich, and he used the greater part of his wealth in doing good; but
he did it all so quietly that few people knew anything about it.There was a large nut-wood on his property; and on one of the
brightest mornings in harvest-time, he always had a nutting-party of
merry girls at his house, where he had abundance of good cheer for
them all day, and a dance in the evening.He was the godfather of
most of the girls; for he was the godfather of half of the parish.All the children called him Godfather, and from them everybody else
had learned to call him so, too.He and Arne knew each other well; and he liked Arne for the sake of
his songs.Now he invited him to the nutting-party; but Arne
declined: he was not used to girls' company, he said."Then you had
better get used to it," answered Godfather.So Arne came to the party, and was nearly the only young man among
the many girls.Such fun as was there, Arne had never seen before in
all his life; and one thing which especially astonished him was, that
the girls laughed for nothing at all: if three laughed, then five
would laugh just because those three laughed.Altogether, they
behaved as if they had lived with each other all their lives; and yet
there were several of them who had never met before that very day.When they caught the bough which they jumped after, they laughed, and
when they did not catch it they laughed also; when they did not find
any nuts, they laughed because they found none; and when they did
find some, they also laughed.They fought for the nutting-hook: those
who got it laughed, and those who did not get it laughed also.Godfather limped after them, trying to beat them with his stick, and
making all the mischief he was good for; those he hit, laughed
because he hit them, and those he missed, laughed because he missed
them.But the whole lot laughed at Arne because he was so grave; and
when at last he could not help laughing, they all laughed again
because he laughed.Then the whole party seated themselves on a large hill; the girls in
a circle, and Godfather in the middle.The sun was scorching hot, but
they did not care the least for it, but sat cracking nuts, giving
Godfather the kernels, and throwing the shells and husks at each
other.Godfather'sh'shed at them, and, as far as he could reach,
beat them with his stick; for he wanted to make them be quiet and
tell tales.But to stop their noise seemed just about as easy as to
stop a carriage running down a hill.Godfather began to tell a tale,
however.At first many of them would not listen; they knew his
stories already; but soon they all listened attentively; and before
they thought of it, they set off tale-telling themselves at full
gallop.Though they had just been so noisy, their tales, to Arne's
great surprise, were very earnest: they ran principally upon love."You, Aasa, know a good tale, I remember from last year," said
Godfather, turning to a plump girl with a round, good-natured face,
who sat plaiting the hair of a younger sister, whose head lay in her
lap."But perhaps several know it already," answered Aasa."Never mind, tell it," they begged."Very well, I'll tell it without any more persuading," she answered;
and then, plaiting her sister's hair all the while, she told and
sang:--

"There was once a grown-up lad who tended cattle, and who often drove
them upwards near a broad stream.On one side was a high steep cliff,
jutting out so far over the stream that when he was upon it he could
talk to any one on the opposite side; and all day he could see a girl
over there tending cattle, but he couldn't go to her.'Now, tell me thy name, thou girl that art sitting
    Up there with thy sheep, so busily knitting,'

he asked over and over for many days, till one day at last there came
an answer:--

   'My name floats about like a duck in wet weather;
    Come over, thou boy in the cap of brown leather.'"This left the lad no wiser than he was before; and he thought he
wouldn't mind her any further.This, however, was much more easily
thought than done, for drive his cattle whichever way he would, it
always, somehow or other, led to that same high steep cliff.Then the
lad grew frightened; and he called over to her--

   'Well, who is your father, and where are you biding?On the road to the church I have ne'er seen you riding.'"The lad asked this because he half believed she was a huldre.[3]

 [3] "Over the whole of Norway, the tradition is current of a
 supernatural being that dwells in the forests and mountains, called
 Huldre or Hulla.She appears like a beautiful woman, and is usually
 clad in a blue petticoat and a white snood; but unfortunately has a
 long tail, which she anxiously tries to conceal when she is among
 people.She is fond of cattle, particularly brindled, of which she
 possesses a beautiful and thriving stock.She was once at a merrymaking, where every one was desirous of
 dancing with the handsome, strange damsel; but in the midst of the
 mirth, a young man, who had just begun a dance with her, happened
 to cast his eye on her tail.Immediately guessing whom he had got
 for a partner, he was not a little terrified; but, collecting
 himself, and unwilling to betray her, he merely said to her when
 the dance was over, 'Fair maid, you will lose your garter.'She
 instantly vanished, but afterwards rewarded the silent and
 considerate youth with beautiful presents and a good breed of
 cattle.The idea entertained of this being is not everywhere the
 same, but varies considerably in different parts of Norway.In some
 places she is described as a handsome female when seen in front,
 but is hollow behind, or else blue; while in others she is known by
 the name of Skogmerte, and is said to be blue, but clad in a green
 petticoat, and probably corresponds to the Swedish Skogsnyfoor.Her
 song--a sound often heard among the mountains--is said to be hollow
 and mournful, differing therein from the music of the subterranean
 beings, which is described by earwitnesses as cheerful and
 fascinating.But she is not everywhere regarded as a solitary wood
 nymph.Huldremen and Huldrefolk are also spoken of, who live
 together in the mountains, and are almost identical with the
 subterranean people.In Hardanger the Huldre people are always clad
 in green, but their cattle are blue, and may be taken when a
 grown-up person casts his belt over them.The Huldres take possession of the forsaken pasture-spots in
 the mountains, and invite people into their mounds, where
 delightful music is to be heard."--_Thorpe's Northern Mythology._

   'My house is burned down, and my father is drowned,
    And the road to the church-hill I never have found.'"This again left the lad no wiser than he was before.In the daytime
he kept hovering about the cliff; and at night he dreamed she danced
with him, and lashed him with a big cow's tail whenever he tried to
catch her.Soon he could neither sleep nor work; and altogether the
lad got in a very poor way.Then once more he called from the cliff--

   'If thou art a huldre, then pray do not spell me;
    If thou art a maiden, then hasten to tell me.'"But there came no answer; and so he was sure she was a huldre.He
gave up tending cattle; but it was all the same; wherever he went,
and whatever he did, he was all the while thinking of the beautiful
huldre who blew on the horn.Soon he could bear it no longer; and one
moonlight evening when all were asleep, he stole away into the
forest, which stood there all dark at the bottom, but with its
tree-tops bright in the moonbeams.He sat down on the cliff, and
called--

   'Run forward, my huldre; my love has o'ercome me;
    My life is a burden; no longer hide from me.'"The lad looked and looked; but she didn't appear.Then he heard
something moving behind him; he turned round and saw a big black
bear, which came forward, squatted on the ground and looked at him.But he ran away from the cliff and through the forest as fast as his
legs could carry him: if the bear followed him, he didn't know, for
he didn't turn round till he lay safely in bed."'It was one of her herd,' the lad thought; 'it isn't worth while to
go there any more;' and he didn't go."Then, one day, while he was chopping wood, a girl came across the
yard who was the living picture of the huldre: but when she drew
nearer, he saw it wasn't she.Then he saw
the girl coming back, and again while she was at a distance she
seemed to be the huldre, and he ran to meet her; but as soon as he
came near, he saw it wasn't she."After this, wherever the lad was--at church at dances, or any other
parties--the girl was, too; and still when at a distance she seemed
to be the huldre, and when near she was somebody else.Then he asked
her whether she was the huldre or not, but she only laughed at him.'One may as well leap into it as creep into it,' the lad thought; and
so he married the girl."But the lad had hardly done this before he ceased to like the girl:
when he was away from her he longed for her; but when he was with her
he yearned for some one he did not see.So the lad behaved very badly
to his wife; but she suffered in silence."Then one day when he was out looking for his horses, he came again
to the cliff; and he sat down and called out--

   'Like fairy moonlight, to me thou seemest;
    Like Midsummer-fires, from afar thou gleamest.'"He felt that it did him good to sit there; and afterwards he went
whenever things were wrong at home."But one day when he was sitting there, he saw the huldre sitting all
alive on the other side blowing her horn.He called over--

   'Ah, dear, art thou come!"Then she answered--

   'Away from thy mind the dreams I am blowing;
    Thy rye is all rotting for want of mowing.'"But then the lad felt frightened and went home again.Ere long,
however, he grew so tired of his wife that he was obliged to go to
the forest again, and he sat down on the cliff.Then was sung over to
him--

   'I dreamed thou wast here; ho, hasten to bind me!No; not over there, but behind you will find me.'"The lad jumped up and looked around him, and caught a glimpse of a
green petticoat just slipping away between the shrubs.He followed,
and it came to a hunting all through the forest.So swift-footed as
that huldre, no human creature could be: he flung steel over her
again and again, but still she ran on just as well as ever.But soon
the lad saw, by her pace, that she was beginning to grow tired,
though he saw, too, by her shape, that she could be no other than the
huldre.'Now,' he thought, you'll be mine easily;' and he caught hold
on her so suddenly and roughly that they both fell, and rolled down
the hills a long way before they could stop themselves.Then the
huldre laughed till it seemed to the lad the mountains sang again.He
took her upon his knee; and so beautiful she was, that never in all
his life he had seen any one like her: exactly like her, he thought
his wife should have been.'Ah, who are you who are so beautiful?'he
asked, stroking her cheek.'I'm your wife,' she
answered."The girls laughed much at that tale, and ridiculed the lad.But
Godfather asked Arne if he had listened well to it."Well, now I'll tell you something," said a little girl with a little
round face, and a very little nose:--

"Once there was a little lad who wished very much to woo a little
girl.They were both grown up; but yet they were very little.And the
lad couldn't in any way muster courage to ask her to have him.He
kept close to her when they came home from church; but, somehow or
other, their chat was always about the weather.He went over to her
at the dancing-parties, and nearly danced her to death; but still he
couldn't bring himself to say what he wanted.'You must learn to
write,' he said to himself; 'then you'll manage matters.'And the lad
set to writing; but he thought it could never be done well enough;
and so he wrote a whole year round before he dared do his letter.Now, the thing was to get it given to her without anybody seeing.He
waited till one day when they were standing all by themselves behind
the church.'I've got a letter for you,' said the lad.'But I can't
read writing,' the girl answered."Then he went to service at the girl's father's house; and he used to
keep hovering round her all day long.Once he had nearly brought
himself to speak; in fact, he had already opened his mouth; but then
a big fly flew in it.'Well, I hope, at any rate, nobody else will
come to take her away,' the lad thought; but nobody came to take her,
because she was so very little."By-and-by, however, some one _did_ come, and he, too, was little.The lad could see very well what he wanted; and when he and the girl
went up-stairs together, the lad placed himself at the key-hole.Then
he who was inside made his offer.'Bad luck to me, I, codfish, who
didn't make haste!'He who was inside kissed the
girl just on her lips----.'No doubt that tasted nice,' the lad
thought.But he who was inside took the girl on his lap.Then the
girl heard him and went to the door.'What do you want, you nasty
boy?'said she, 'why can't you leave me alone?'--'I?I only wanted to
ask you to have me for your bridesman.'--'No; that, my brother's
going to be,' the girl answered, banging the door to.The girls laughed very much at this tale, and afterwards pelted each
other with husks.Then Godfather wished Eli Boeen to tell something."Well, she might tell what she had told him on the hill, the last
time he came to see her parents, when she gave him the new garters.Eli laughed very much; and it was some time before she would tell it:
however, she did at last,--

"A lad and a girl were once walking together on a road.'Ah, look at
that thrush that follows us!''It follows _me_,' said
the lad.'It's just as likely to be _me_,' the girl answered.'That,
we'll soon find out,' said the lad; 'you go that way, while I go
this, and we'll meet up yonder.''Well, didn't it follow
me?''No; it followed me,' answered the
girl.They went together again for some
distance, but then there was only one thrush; and the lad thought it
flew on his side, but the girl thought it flew on hers.'Devil a bit,
I care for that thrush,' said the lad."But no sooner had they said this, than the thrush flew away.'It was
on _your_ side, it was,' said the lad.'Thank you,' answered the
girl; 'but I clearly saw it was on _your_ side.--But see!'Indeed, it's on _my_ side,' the lad exclaimed.Then
the girl got angry: 'Ah, well, I wish I may never stir if I go with
you any longer!'"Then the thrush, too, left the lad; and he felt so dull that he
called out to the girl, 'Is the thrush with you?'--'No; isn't it with
you?'--'Ah, no; you must come here again, and then perhaps it will
follow you.'"The girl came; and she and the lad walked on together, hand in
hand.'Quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the girl's side;
'quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the lad's side; 'quitt,
quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on every side; and when they looked
there were a hundred thousand million thrushes all round them.said the girl, looking up at the lad.All the girls thought this was such a nice tale.Then Godfather said they must tell what they had dreamed last night,
and he would decide who had dreamed the nicest things.And then there was no end of tittering and whispering.But soon one
after another began to think she had such a nice dream last night;
and then others thought it could not possibly be so nice as what they
had dreamed; and at last they all got a great mind for telling their
dreams.Yet they must not be told aloud, but to one only, and that
one must by no means be Godfather.Arne had all this time been
sitting quietly a little lower down the hill, and so the girls
thought they dared tell their dreams to him.Then Arne seated himself under a hazel-bush; and Aasa, the girl who
had told the first tale, came over to him.She hesitated a while, but
then began,--

"I dreamed I was standing by a large lake.Then I saw one walking on
the water, and it was one whose name I will not say.He stepped into
a large water-lily, and sat there singing.But I launched out upon
one of the large leaves of the lily which lay floating on the water;
for on it I would row over to him.But no sooner had I come upon the
leaf than it began to sink with me, and I became much frightened, and
I wept.Then he came rowing along in the water-lily, and lifted me
up to him; and we rowed all over the whole lake.Next came the little girl who had told the tale about the little
lad,--

"I dreamed I had caught a little bird, and I was so pleased with it,
and I thought I wouldn't let it loose till I came home in our room.But there I dared not let it loose, for I was afraid father and
mother might tell me to let it go again.So I took it up-stairs; but
I could not let it loose there, either, for the cat was lurking
about.Then I didn't know what in the world to do; yet I took it into
the barn.Dear me, there were so many cracks, I was afraid it might
go away!Well, then I went down again into the yard; and there, it
seemed to me some one was standing whose name I will not say.He
stood playing with a big, big dog.'I would rather play with that
bird of yours,' he said, and drew very near to me.But then it seemed
to me I began running away; and both he and the big dog ran after me
all round the yard; but then mother opened the front door, pulled me
hastily in, and banged the door after me.The lad, however, stood
laughing outside, with his face against the window-pane.'Look,
here's the bird,' he said; and, only think, he had my bird out there!Then came the girl who had told about the thrushes--Eli, they called
her.She was laughing so much that she could not speak for some time;
but at last she began,--

"I had been looking forward with very much pleasure to our nutting in
the wood to-day; and so last night I dreamed I was sitting here on
the hill.The sun shone brightly; and I had my lap full of nuts.But
there came a little squirrel among them, and it sat on its hind-legs
and ate them all up.Afterwards some more dreams were told him; and then the girls would
have him say which was the nicest.Of course, he must have plenty of
time for consideration; and meanwhile Godfather and the whole flock
went down to the house, leaving Arne to follow.They skipped down the
hill, and when they came to the plain went all in a row singing
towards the house.Arne sat alone on the hill, listening to the singing.Strong sunlight
fell on the group of girls, and their white bodices shone bright, as
they went dancing over the meadows, every now and then clasping each
other round the waist; while Godfather limped behind, threatening
them with a stick because they trod down his hay.Arne thought no
more of the dreams, and soon he no longer looked after the girls.His
thoughts went floating far away beyond the valley, like the fine
air-threads, while he remained behind on the hill, spinning; and
before he was aware of it he had woven a close web of sadness.More
than ever, he longed to go away.he said to himself; "surely, I've been
lingering long enough now!"He promised himself that he would speak
to the mother about it as soon as he reached home, however it might
turn out.With greater force than ever, his thoughts turned to his song, "Over
the mountains high;" and never before had the words come so swiftly,
or linked themselves into rhyme so easily; they seemed almost like
girls sitting in a circle on the brow of a hill.He had a piece of
paper with him, and placing it upon his knee, he wrote down the
verses as they came.When he had finished the song, he rose like one
freed from a burden.He felt unwilling to see any one, and went
homewards by the way through the wood, though he knew he should then
have to walk during the night.The first time he stopped to rest on
the way, he put his hand to his pocket to take out the song,
intending to sing it aloud to himself through the wood; but he found
he had left it behind at the place where it was composed.One of the girls went on the hill to look for him; she did not find
him, but she found his song.X.

LOOSENING THE WEATHER-VANE.To speak to the mother about going away, was more easily thought of
than done.He spoke again about Christian, and those letters which
had never come; but then the mother went away, and for days
afterwards he thought her eyes looked red and swollen.He noticed,
too, that she then got nicer food for him than usual; and this gave
him another sign of her state of mind with regard to him.One day he went to cut fagots in a wood which bordered upon another
belonging to the parsonage, and through which the road ran.Just
where he was going to cut his fagots, people used to come in autumn
to gather whortleberries.He had laid aside his axe to take off his
jacket, and was just going to begin work, when two girls came walking
along with a basket to gather berries.He used generally to hide
himself rather than meet girls, and he did so now."Well, but, then, don't go any farther; here are many basketfuls.""I thought I heard a rustling among the trees!"The girls rushed towards each other, clasped each other round the
waist, and for a little while stood still, scarcely drawing breath."It's nothing, I dare say; come, let's go on picking.""It was nice you came to the parsonage to-day, Eli.Haven't you
anything to tell me?""Yes; I've been to see Godfather.""Well, you've told me that; but haven't you anything to tell me about
_him_--you know who?""Indeed, he has: father and mother pretended to know nothing of it;
but I went up-stairs and hid myself.""Yes; I believe father told him where I was; he's always so tiresome
now.""And so he came there?--Sit down, sit down; here, near me."Yes; but he didn't say much, for he was so bashful.""Tell me what he said, every word; pray, every word!"'You know what I want to say to you,' he said, sitting down
beside me on the chest.""I wished very much to get loose again; but he wouldn't let me.'Dear
Eli,' he said----" She laughed, and the other one laughed, too.And then both laughed together, "Ha, ha, ha, ha!"At last the laughing came to an end, and they were both quiet for a
while.Then the one who had first spoken asked in a low voice,
"Wasn't it strange he took you round your waist?"Either the other girl did not answer that question, or she answered
in so low a voice that it could not be heard; perhaps she only
answered by a smile."Didn't your father or your mother say anything afterwards?"asked
the first girl, after a pause."Father came up and looked at me; but I turned away from him because
he laughed at me.""No, she didn't say anything; but she wasn't so strict as usual.""Well, you've done with him, I think?""Was it thus he took you round your waist?""Well, then;--it was thus...."

"Eli?""Do you think there will ever be anybody come in that way to me?"Then they laughed again; and there was much whispering and tittering.Soon the girls went away; they had not seen either Arne or the axe
and jacket, and he was glad of it.A few days after, he gave Opplands-Knut a little farm on Kampen."You shall not be lonely any longer," Arne said.That winter Arne went to the parsonage for some time to do carpentry;
and both the girls were often there together.When Arne saw them, he
often wondered who it might be that now came to woo Eli Boeen.One day he had to drive for the clergyman's daughter and Eli; he
could not understand a word they said, though he had very quick ears.Sometimes Mathilde spoke to him; and then Eli always laughed and hid
her face.Mathilde asked him if it was true that he could make
verses."No," he said quickly; then they both laughed; and chattered
and laughed again.He felt vexed; and afterwards when he met them
seemed not to take any notice of them.Once he was sitting in the servants' hall while a dance was going on,
and Mathilde and Eli both came to see it.They stood together in a
corner, disputing about something; Eli would not do it, but Mathilde
would, and she at last gained her point.Then they both came over to
Arne, courtesied, and asked him if he could dance.He said he could
not; and then both turned aside and ran away, laughing.In fact, they
were always laughing, Arne thought; and he became brave.But soon
after, he got the clergyman's foster-son, a boy of about twelve, to
teach him to dance, when no one was by.Eli had a little brother of the same age as the clergyman's
foster-son.These two boys were playfellows; and Arne made sledges,
snow-shoes and snares for them; and often talked to them about their
sisters, especially about Eli.One day Eli's brother brought Arne a
message that he ought to make his hair a little smoother."Eli did; but she told me not to say it was she."A few days after, Arne sent word that Eli ought to laugh a little
less.The boy brought back word that Arne ought by all means to laugh
a little more.Eli's brother once asked Arne to give him something that he had
written.He complied, without thinking any more about the matter.But
in a few days after, the boy, thinking to please Arne, told him that
Eli and Mathilde liked his writing very much."Where, then, have they seen any of it?""Well, it was for them, I asked for some of it the other day."Then Arne asked the boys to bring him something their sisters had
written.They did so; and he corrected the errors in the writing with
his carpenter's pencil, and asked the boys to lay it in some place
where their sisters might easily find it.Soon after, he found the
paper in his jacket pocket; and at the foot was written, "Corrected
by a conceited fellow."The next day, Arne completed his work at the parsonage, and returned
home.So gentle as he was that winter, the mother had never seen him,
since that sad time just after the father's death.He read the sermon
to her, accompanied her to church, and was in every way very kind.But she knew only too well that one great reason for his increased
kindness was, that he meant to go away when spring came.Then one day
a message came from Boeen, asking him to go there to do carpentry.Arne started, and, apparently without thinking of what he said,
replied that he would come.But no sooner had the messenger left than
the mother said, "You may well be astonished!"Well, is there anything strange in that?"Arne asked, without
looking at her."And, why not from Boeen, as well as any other place?""From Boeen and Birgit Boeen!--Baard, who made your father a <DW36>,
and all only for Birgit's sake!"exclaimed Arne; "was that Baard Boeen?"The whole of the father's
life seemed unrolled before them, and at that moment they saw the
black thread which had always run through it.Then they began talking
about those grand days of his, when old Eli Boeen had himself offered
him his daughter Birgit, and he had refused her: they passed on
through his life till the day when his spine had been broken; and
they both agreed that Baard's fault was the less.Still, it was he
who had made the father a <DW36>; he, it was."Have I not even yet done with father?"Arne thought; and determined
at the same moment that he would go to Boeen.As he went walking, with his saw on his shoulder, over the ice
towards Boeen, it seemed to him a beautiful place.The dwelling-house
always seemed as if it was fresh painted; and--perhaps because he
felt a little cold--it just then looked to him very sheltered and
comfortable.He did not, however, go straight in, but went round by
the cattle-house, where a flock of thick-haired goats stood in the
snow, gnawing the bark off some fir twigs.A shepherd's dog ran
backwards and forwards on the barn steps, barking as if the devil was
coming to the house; but when Arne went to him, he wagged his tail
and allowed himself to be patted.The kitchen door at the upper end
of the house was often opened, and Arne looked over there every time;
but he saw no one except the milkmaid, carrying some pails, or the
cook, throwing something to the goats.In the barn the threshers
were hard at work; and to the left, in front of the woodshed, a lad
stood chopping fagots, with many piles of them behind him.Arne laid away his saw and went into the kitchen: the floor was
strewed with white sand and chopped juniper leaves; copper kettles
shone on the walls; china and earthenware stood in rows upon the
shelves; and the servants were preparing the dinner."Step into the sitting-room," said one of the servants,
pointing to an inner door with a brass knob.He went in: the room was
brightly painted--the ceiling, with clusters of roses; the cupboards,
with red, and the names of the owners in black letters; the bedstead,
also with red, bordered with blue stripes.Beside the stove, a
broad-shouldered, mild-looking man, with long light hair, sat hooping
some tubs; and at the large table, a slender, tall woman, in a
close-fitting dress and linen cap, sat sorting some corn into two
heaps: no one else was in the room."Good day, and a blessing on the work," said Arne, taking off his
cap.Both looked up; and the man smiled and asked who it was."I am
he who has come to do carpentry."The man smiled still more, and said, while he leaned forward again to
his work, "Oh, all right, Arne Kampen."exclaimed the wife, staring down at the floor.The man
looked up quickly, and said, smiling once more, "A son of Nils, the
tailor;" and then he began working again.Soon the wife rose, went to the shelf, turned from it to the
cupboard, once more turned away, and, while rummaging for something
in the table drawer, she asked, without looking up, "Is _he_ going to
work _here_?""Yes, that he is," the husband answered, also without looking up."Nobody has asked you to sit down, it seems," he added, turning to
Arne, who then took a seat.The wife went out, and the husband
continued working: and so Arne asked whether he, too, might begin.The wife did not return; but next time the door opened, it was Eli
who entered.At first, she appeared not to see Arne, but when he
rose to meet her she turned half round and gave him her hand; yet
she did not look at him.They exchanged a few words, while the
father worked on.Eli was slender and upright, her hands were small,
with round wrists, her hair was braided, and she wore a dress with a
close-fitting bodice.She laid the table for dinner: the laborers
dined in the next room; but Arne, with the family."No; she's up-stairs, weighing wool.""Yes; but she says she won't have anything.""She wouldn't let me make a fire."After dinner, Arne began to work; and in the evening he again sat
with the family.The wife and Eli sewed, while the husband employed
himself in some trifling work, and Arne helped him.They worked on in
silence above an hour; for Eli, who seemed to be the one who usually
did the talking, now said nothing.Arne thought with dismay how often
it was just so in his own home; and yet he had never felt it till
now.At last, Eli seemed to think she had been silent quite long
enough, and, after drawing a deep breath, she burst out laughing.Then the father laughed; and Arne felt it was ridiculous and began,
too.Afterwards they talked about several things, soon the
conversation was principally between Arne and Eli, the father now and
then putting in a word edgewise.But once after Arne had been
speaking at some length, he looked up, and his eyes met those of the
mother, Birgit, who had laid down her work, and sat gazing at him.Then she went on with her work again; but the next word he spoke made
her look up once more.Bedtime drew near, and they all went to their own rooms.Arne thought
he would take notice of the dream he had the first night in a fresh
place; but he could see no meaning in it.During the whole day he had
talked very little with the husband; yet now in the night he dreamed
of no one in the house but him.The last thing was, that Baard was
sitting playing at cards with Nils, the tailor.The latter looked
very pale and angry; but Baard was smiling, and he took all the
tricks.Arne stayed at Boeen several days; and a great deal was done, but very
little said.Not only the people in the parlor, but also the
servants, the housemen, everybody about the place, even the women,
were silent.In the yard was an old dog which barked whenever a
stranger came near; but if any of the people belonging to the place
heard him, they always said "Hush!"and then he went away, growling,
and lay down.At Arne's own home was a large weather-vane, and here
was one still larger which he particularly noticed because it did not
turn.It shook whenever the wind was high, as though it wished to
turn; and Arne stood looking at it so long that he felt at last he
must climb up to unloose it.It was not frozen fast, as he thought:
but a stick was fixed against it to prevent it from turning.He took
the stick out and threw it down; Baard was just passing below, and it
struck him."Leave it alone; it makes a wailing noise when it turns.""Well, I think even that's better than silence," said Arne, seating
himself astride on the ridge of the roof.Baard looked up at Arne,
and Arne down at Baard.Then Baard smiled and said, "He who must wail
when he speaks had better he silent."Words sometimes haunt us long after they were uttered, especially
when they were last words.So Baard's words followed Arne as he came
down from the roof in the cold, and they were still with him when he
went into the sitting-room in the evening.It was twilight; and Eli
stood at the window, looking away over the ice which lay bright in
the moonlight.Arne went to the other window, and looked out also.Indoors it was warm and quiet; outdoors it was cold, and a sharp wind
swept through the vale, bending the branches of the trees, and making
their shadows creep trembling on the snow.A light shone over from
the parsonage, then vanished, then appeared again, taking various
shapes and colors, as a distant light always seems to do when one
looks at it long and intently.Opposite, the mountain stood dark,
with deep shadow at its foot, where a thousand fairy tales hovered;
but with its snowy upper plains bright in the moonlight.The stars
were shining, and northern lights were flickering in one quarter of
the sky, but they did not spread.A little way from the window, down
towards the water, stood some trees, whose shadows kept stealing over
to each other; but the tall ash stood alone, writing on the snow.All was silent, save now and then, when a long wailing sound was
heard."It's the weather-vane," said Eli; and after a little while she added
in a lower tone, as if to herself, "it must have come unfastened."But Arne had been like one who wished to speak and could not.Now he
said, "Do you remember that tale about the thrushes?""It was you who told it, indeed."I often think there's something that sings when all is still," she
said, in a voice so soft and low that he felt as if he heard it now
for the first time."It is the good within our own souls," he said.She looked at him as if she thought that answer meant too much; and
they both stood silent a few moments.Then she asked, while she wrote
with her finger on the window-pane, "Have you made any songs lately?"He blushed; but she did not see it, and so she asked once more, "How
do you manage to make songs?""I store up the thoughts that other people let slip."She was silent for a long while; perhaps thinking she might have had
some thoughts fit for songs, but had let them slip."How strange it is," she said, at last, as though to herself, and
beginning to write again on the window-pane."I made a song the first time I had seen you.""Behind the parsonage, that evening you went away from there;--I saw
you in the water."She laughed, and was quiet for a while.Arne had never done such a thing before, but he repeated the song
now:

   "Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
        Her lover to meet," &c.[4]

 [4] As on page 68.Eli listened attentively, and stood silent long after he had
finished.At last she exclaimed, "Ah, what a pity for her!""I feel as if I had not made that song myself," he said; and then
stood like her, thinking over it."But that won't be my fate, I hope," she said, after a pause."No; I was thinking rather of myself.""I don't know; I felt so then."The next day, when Arne came into the room to dinner, he went over to
the window.Outdoors it was dull and foggy, but indoors, warm and
comfortable; and on the window-pane was written with a finger, "Arne,
Arne, Arne," and nothing but "Arne," over and over again: it was at
that window, Eli stood the evening before.Next day, Arne came into the room and said he had heard in the yard
that the clergyman's daughter, Mathilde, had just gone to the town;
as she thought, for a few days, but as her parents intended, for a
year or two.Eli had heard nothing of this before, and now she fell
down fainting.Arne had never seen any one faint, and he was much
frightened.He ran for the maids; they ran for the parents, who came
hurrying in; and there was a disturbance all over the house, and the
dog barked on the barn steps.Soon after, when Arne came in again,
the mother was kneeling at the bedside, while the father supported
Eli's drooping head.The maids were running about--one for water,
another for hartshorn which was in the cupboard, while a third
unfastened her jacket.the mother said; "I see it was wrong in us not to
tell her; it was you, Baard, who would have it so; God help you!""I wished to tell her, indeed; but nothing's to
be as I wish; God help you!You're always so harsh with her, Baard;
you don't understand her; you don't know what it is to love anybody,
you don't.""She isn't like some others who can
bear sorrow; it quite puts her down, poor slight thing, as she is.Wake up, my child, and we'll be kind to you!wake up, Eli, my own
darling, and don't grieve us so.""You always either talk too much or too little," Baard said, at last,
looking over to Arne, as though he did not wish him to hear such
things, but to leave the room.As, however, the maid-servants stayed,
Arne thought he, too, might stay; but he went over to the window.Soon the sick girl revived so far as to be able to look round and
recognize those about her; but then also memory returned, and she
called wildly for Mathilde, went into hysterics, and sobbed till it
was painful to be in the room.The mother tried to soothe her, and
the father sat down where she could see him; but she pushed them both
from her.she cried; "I don't like you; go away!""Oh, Eli, how can you say you don't like your own parents?"you're unkind to me, and you take away every pleasure from me!"don't say such hard things," said the mother, imploringly."Yes, mother," she exclaimed; "now I _must_ say it!Yes, mother; you
wish to marry me to that bad man; and I won't have him!You shut me
up here, where I'm never happy save when I'm going out!And you take
away Mathilde from me; the only one in the world I love and long for!Oh, God, what will become of me, now Mathilde is gone!""But you haven't been much with her lately," Baard said."What did that matter, so long as I could look over to her from that
window," the poor girl answered, weeping in a childlike way that Arne
had never before seen in any one."Why, you couldn't see her there," said Baard."Still, I saw the house," she answered; and the mother added
passionately, "You don't understand such things, you don't.""Now, I can never again go to the window," said Eli."When I rose in
the morning, I went there; in the evening I sat there in the
moonlight: I went there when I could go to no one else.She writhed in the bed, and went again into hysterics.Baard sat down on a stool a little way from the bed, and continued
looking at her.But Eli did not recover so soon as they expected.Towards evening
they saw she would have a serious illness, which had probably been
coming upon her for some time; and Arne was called to assist in
carrying her up-stairs to her room.She lay quiet and unconscious,
looking very pale.The mother sat by the side of her bed, the father
stood at the foot, looking at her: afterwards he went to his work.So
did Arne; but that night before he went to sleep, he prayed for her;
prayed that she who was so young and fair might be happy in this
world, and that no one might bar away joy from her.The next day when Arne came in, he found the father and mother
sitting talking together: the mother had been weeping.Arne asked how
Eli was; both expected the other to give an answer, and so for some
time none was given, but at last the father said, "Well, she's very
bad to-day."Afterwards Arne heard that she had been raving all night, or, as the
father said, "talking foolery."She had a violent fever, knew no one,
and would not eat, and the parents were deliberating whether they
should send for a doctor.When afterwards they both went to the
sick-room, leaving Arne behind, he felt as if life and death were
struggling together up there, but he was kept outside.In a few days, however, Eli became a little better.But once when the
father was tending her, she took it into her head to have Narrifas,
the bird which Mathilde had given her, set beside the bed.Then Baard
told her that--as was really the case--in the confusion the bird had
been forgotten, and was starved.The mother was just coming in as
Baard was saying this, and while yet standing in the doorway, she
cried out, "Oh, dear me, what a monster you are, Baard, to tell it to
that poor little thing!See, she's fainting again; God forgive you!"When Eli revived she again asked for the bird; said its death was a
bad omen for Mathilde; and wished to go to her: then she fainted
again.Baard stood looking on till she grew so much worse that he
wanted to help, too, in tending her; but the mother pushed him away,
and said she would do all herself.Then Baard gave a long sad look at
both of them, put his cap straight with both hands, turned aside and
went out.Soon after, the Clergyman and his wife came; for the fever
heightened, and grew so violent that they did not know whether it
would turn to life or death.The Clergyman as well as his wife spoke
to Baard about Eli, and hinted that he was too harsh with her; but
when they heard what he had told her about the bird, the Clergyman
plainly told him it was very rough, and said he would have her taken
to his own house as soon as she was well enough to be moved.The
Clergyman's wife would scarcely look at Baard; she wept, and went to
sit with the sick one; then sent for the doctor, and came several
times a day to carry out his directions.Baard went wandering
restlessly about from one place to another in the yard, going
oftenest to those places where he could be alone.There he would
stand still by the hour together; then, put his cap straight and work
again a little.The mother did not speak to him, and they scarcely looked at each
other.He used to go and see Eli several times in the day; he took
off his shoes before he went up-stairs, left his cap outside, and
opened the door cautiously.When he came in, Birgit would turn her
head, but take no notice of him, and then sit just as before,
stooping forwards, with her head on her hands, looking at Eli, who
lay still and pale, unconscious of all that was passing around her.Baard would stand awhile at the foot of the bed and look at them
both, but say nothing: once when Eli moved as though she were waking,
he stole away directly as quietly as he had come.Arne often thought words had been exchanged between man and wife and
parents and child which had been long gathering, and would be long
remembered.He longed to go away, though he wished to know before he
went what would be the end of Eli's illness; but then he thought he
might always hear about her even after he had left; and so he went to
Baard telling him he wished to go home: the work which he came to do
was completed.Baard was sitting outdoors on a chopping-block,
scratching in the snow with a stick: Arne recognized the stick: it
was the one which had fastened the weather-vane."Well, perhaps it isn't worth your while to stay here now; yet I feel
as if I don't like you to go away, either," said Baard, without
looking up.He said no more; neither did Arne; but after a while he
walked away to do some work, taking for granted that he was to remain
at Boeen.Some time after, when he was called to dinner, he saw Baard still
sitting on the block.He went over to him, and asked how Eli was."I think she's very bad to-day," Baard said.Arne felt as if somebody asked him to sit down, and he seated himself
opposite Baard on the end of a felled tree."I've often thought of your father lately," Baard said so
unexpectedly that Arne did not know how to answer."You know, I suppose, what was between us?""Well, you know, as may be expected, only one half of the story, and
think I'm greatly to blame.""You have, I dare say, settled that affair with your God, as surely
as my father has done so," Arne said, after a pause."Well, some people might think so," Baard answered."When I found
this stick, I felt it was so strange that you should come here and
unloose the weather-vane.He had
taken off his cap, and sat silently looking at it."I was about fourteen years old when I became acquainted with your
father, and he was of the same age.He was very wild, and he couldn't
bear any one to be above him in anything.So he always had a grudge
against me because I stood first, and he, second, when we were
confirmed.He often offered to fight me, but we never came to it;
most likely because neither of us felt sure who would beat.And a
strange thing it is, that although he fought every day, no accident
came from it; while the first time I did, it turned out as badly as
could be; but, it's true, I had been wanting to fight long enough."Nils fluttered about all the girls, and they, about him.There was
only one I would have, and her he took away from me at every dance,
at every wedding, and at every party; it was she who is now my
wife.... Often, as I sat there, I felt a great mind to try my
strength upon him for this thing; but I was afraid I should lose, and
I knew if I did, I should lose her, too.Then, when everybody had
gone, I would lift the weights he had lifted, and kick the beam he
had kicked; but the next time he took the girl from me, I was afraid
to meddle with him, although once, when he was flirting with her just
in my face, I went up to a tall fellow who stood by and threw him
against the beam, as if in fun.And Nils grew pale, too, when he saw
it."Even if he had been kind to her; but he was false to her again and
again.I almost believe, too, she loved him all the more every time.I thought now it must either break or
bear.The Lord, too, would not have him going about any longer; and
so he fell a little more heavily than I meant him to do.They sat silent for a while; then Baard went on:

"I once more made my offer.She said neither yes nor no; but I
thought she would like me better afterwards.The
wedding was kept down in the valley, at the house of one of her
aunts, whose property she inherited.We had plenty when we started,
and it has now increased.Our estates lay side by side, and when we
married they were thrown into one, as I always, from a boy, thought
they might be.But many other things didn't turn out as I expected."He was silent for several minutes; and Arne thought he wept; but he
did not."In the beginning of our married life, she was quiet and very sad.I
had nothing to say to comfort her, and so I was silent.Afterwards,
she began sometimes to take to these fidgeting ways which you have, I
dare say, noticed in her; yet it was a change, and so I said nothing
then, either.But one really happy day, I haven't known ever since I
was married, and that's now twenty years...."

He broke the stick in two pieces; and then sat for a while looking at
them."When Eli grew bigger, I thought she would be happier among strangers
than at home.It was seldom I wished to carry out my own will in
anything, and whenever I did, it generally turned out badly; so it
was in this case.The mother longed after her child, though only the
lake lay between them; and afterwards I saw, too, that Eli's training
at the parsonage was in some ways not the right thing for her; but
then it was too late: now I think she likes neither father nor
mother."He had taken off his cap again; and now his long hair hung down over
his eyes; he stroked it back with both hands, and put on his cap as
if he were going away; but when, as he was about to rise, he turned
towards the house, he checked himself and added, while looking up at
the bed-room window."I thought it better that she and Mathilde shouldn't see each other
to say good-bye: that, too, was wrong.I told her the wee bird was
dead; for it was my fault, and so I thought it better to confess; but
that again was wrong.And so it is with everything: I've always meant
to do for the best, but it has always turned out for the worst; and
now things have come to such a pass that both wife and daughter speak
ill of me, and I'm going here lonely."A servant-girl called out to them that the dinner was becoming cold."I hear the horses neighing; I think somebody has
forgotten them," he said, and went away to the stable to give them
some hay.Arne rose, too; he felt as if he hardly knew whether Baard had been
speaking or not.The mother watched by her night
and day, and never came down-stairs; the father came up as usual,
with his boots off, and leaving his cap outside the door.Arne still
remained at the house.He and the father used to sit together in
the evening; and Arne began to like him much, for Baard was a
well-informed, deep-thinking man, though he seemed afraid of saying
what he knew.In his own way, he, too, enjoyed Arne's company, for
Arne helped his thoughts and told him of things which were new to
him.Eli soon began to sit up part of the day, and as she recovered, she
often took little fancies into her head.Thus, one evening when Arne
was sitting in the room below, singing songs in a clear, loud voice,
the mother came down with a message from Eli, asking him if he would
go up-stairs and sing to her, that she might also hear the words.It
seemed as if he had been singing to Eli all the time, for when the
mother spoke he turned red, and rose as if he would deny having done
so, though no one charged him with it.He soon collected himself,
however, and replied evasively, that he could sing so very little.The mother said it did not seem so when he was alone.He had not seen Eli since the day he helped to
carry her up-stairs; he thought she must be much altered, and he
felt half afraid to see her.But when he gently opened the door and
went in, he found the room quite dark, and he could see no one.He
stopped at the door-way.Eli asked in a clear, low voice."It's Arne Kampen," he said in a gentle, guarded tone, so that his
words might fall softly."It was very kind of you to come.""Won't you sit down, Arne?"she added after a while, and Arne felt
his way to a chair at the foot of the bed."It did me good to hear
you singing; won't you sing a little to me up here?""If I only knew anything you would like."She was silent a while: then she said, "Sing a hymn."And he sang
one: it was the confirmation hymn.When he had finished he heard her
weeping, and so he was afraid to sing again; but in a little while
she said, "Sing one more."And he sang another: it was the one which
is generally sung while the catechumens are standing in the aisle."How many things I've thought over while I've been lying here," Eli
said.He did not know what to answer; and he heard her weeping again
in the dark.A clock that was ticking on the wall warned for
striking, and then struck.Eli breathed deeply several times, as if
she would lighten her breast, and then she said, "One knows so
little; I knew neither father nor mother.I haven't been kind to
them; and now it seems so sad to hear that hymn."When we talk in the darkness, we speak more faithfully than when we
see each other's face; and we also say more."It does one good to hear you talk so," Arne replied, just
remembering what she had said when she was taken ill."If now this had not happened to me,"
she went on, "God only knows how long I might have gone before I
found mother.""She has talked matters over with you lately, then?""Yes, every day; she has done hardly anything else.""Then, I'm sure you've heard many things."They were silent; and Arne had thoughts which he could not utter.Eli
was the first to link their words again."You are said to be like your father.""People say so," he replied evasively.She did not notice the tone of his voice, and so, after a while she
returned to the subject."Sing a song to me... one that you've made yourself.""I have none," he said; for it was not his custom to confess he had
himself composed the songs he sang."I'm sure you have; and I'm sure, too, you'll sing one of them when I
ask you."What he had never done for any one else, he now did for her, as he
sang the following song,--

   "The Tree's early leaf-buds were bursting their brown:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the blossoms have grown,'
    Prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown."The Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the berries have grown,'
    Said the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung."The Tree bore his fruit in the Midsummer glow:
    Said the girl, 'May I gather thy berries or no?''Yes; all thou canst see;
            Take them; all are for thee,'
    Said the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low."He, too, remained silent after
it, as though he had sung more than he could say.Darkness has a strong influence over those who are sitting in it and
dare not speak: they are never so near each other as then.If she
only turned on the pillow, or moved her hand on the blanket, or
breathed a little more heavily, he heard it."Arne, couldn't you teach me to make songs?""Yes, I have, these last few days; but I can't manage it.""What, then, did you wish to have in them?""Something about my mother, who loved your father so dearly.""Yes, indeed it is; and I have wept over it.""You shouldn't search for subjects; they come of themselves.""Just as other dear things come--unexpectedly.""I wonder, Arne, you're longing to go away;
you who have such a world of beauty within yourself.""Do _you_ know I am longing?"She did not answer, but lay still a few moments as if in thought."Arne, you mustn't go away," she said; and the words came warm to his
heart."Well, sometimes I have less mind to go.""Your mother must love you much, I'm sure."Go over to Kampen, when you're well again."And all at once, he fancied her sitting in the bright room at Kampen,
looking out on the mountains; his chest began to heave, and the blood
rushed to his face."It's warm in here," he said, rising."You must come over to see us oftener; mother's so fond of you.""I should like to come myself, too;... but still I must have some
errand."Eli lay silent for a while, as if she was turning over something in
her mind."I believe," she said, "mother has something to ask you
about."...

They both felt the room was becoming very hot; he wiped his brow, and
he heard her rise in the bed.No sound could be heard either in the
room or down-stairs, save the ticking of the clock on the wall.There
was no moon, and the darkness was deep; when he looked through the
green window, it seemed to him as if he was looking into a wood; when
he looked towards Eli he could see nothing, but his thoughts went
over to her, and then his heart throbbed till he could himself hear
its beating.Before his eyes flickered bright sparks; in his ears
came a rushing sound; still faster throbbed his heart: he felt he
must rise or say something.But then she exclaimed,

"How I wish it were summer!"And he heard again the sound of the
cattle-bells, the horn from the mountains, and the singing from the
valleys; and saw the fresh green foliage, the Swart-water glittering
in the sunbeams, the houses rocking in it, and Eli coming out and
sitting on the shore, just as she did that evening."If it were
summer," she said, "and I were sitting on the hill, I think I could
sing a song."He smiled gladly, and asked, "What would it be about?""About something bright; about--well, I hardly know what myself."He rose in glad excitement; but, on second thoughts,
sat down again."I sang to you when you asked me.""Yes, I know you did; but I can't tell you this; no!"Eli, do you think I would laugh at the little verse you have made?""No, I don't think you would, Arne; but it isn't anything I've made
myself.""Oh, it's by somebody else then?""Then, you can surely say it to me.""No, no, I can't; don't ask me again, Arne!"The last words were almost inaudible; it seemed as if she had hidden
her head under the bedclothes."Eli, now you're not kind to me as I was to you," he said, rising."But, Arne, there's a difference... you don't understand me... but
it was... I don't know... another time... don't be offended with
me, Arne!Though he asked, he did not believe she was.She still wept; he
felt he must draw nearer or go quite away.But he did not know what to say more, and
was silent."It's something--"

His voice trembled, and he stopped."You mustn't refuse... I would ask you...."

"Is it the song?""No... Eli, I wish so much...." He heard her breathing fast and
deeply... "I wish so much... to hold one of your hands."She did not answer; he listened intently--drew nearer, and clasped a
warm little hand which lay on the coverlet.Then steps were heard coming up-stairs; they came nearer and nearer;
the door was opened; and Arne unclasped his hand.It was the mother,
who came in with a light."I think you're sitting too long in the
dark," she said, putting the candlestick on the table.But neither
Eli nor Arne could bear the light; she turned her face to the pillow,
and he shaded his eyes with his hand."Well, it pains a little at
first, but it soon passes off," said the mother.Arne looked on the floor for something which he had not dropped, and
then went down-stairs.The next day, he heard that Eli intended to come down in the
afternoon.He put his tools together, and said good-bye.When she
came down he had gone.MARGIT CONSULTS THE CLERGYMAN.Up between the mountains, the spring comes late.The post, who in
winter passes along the high-road thrice a week, in April passes only
once; and the highlanders know then that outside, the snow is
shovelled away, the ice broken, the steamers are running, and the
plough is struck into the earth.Here, the snow still lies six feet
deep; the cattle low in their stalls; the birds arrive, but feel cold
and hide themselves.Occasionally some traveller arrives, saying he
has left his carriage down in the valley; he brings flowers, which he
examines; he picked them by the wayside.The people watch the advance
of the season, talk over their matters, and look up at the sun and
round about, to see how much he is able to do each day.They scatter
ashes on the snow, and think of those who are now picking flowers.It was at this time of year, old Margit Kampen went one day to the
parsonage, and asked whether she might speak to "father."She was
invited into the study, where the clergyman,--a slender, fair-haired,
gentle-looking man, with large eyes and spectacles,--received her
kindly, recognized her, and asked her to sit down."Is there something the matter with Arne again?"he inquired, as if
Arne had often been a subject of conversation between them.I haven't anything wrong to say about him; but yet
it's so sad," said Margit, looking deeply grieved.I can hardly think he'll even stay with me till
spring comes up here.""But he has promised never to go away from you.""That's true; but, dear me!he must now be his own master; and if his
mind's set upon going away, go, he must."Well, after all, I don't think he will leave you.""Well, perhaps not; but still, if he isn't happy at home?am I then
to have it upon my conscience that I stand in his way?Sometimes I
feel as if I ought even to ask him to leave.""How do you know he is longing now, more than ever?"Since the middle of the winter, he hasn't
worked out in the parish a single day; but he has been to the town
three times, and has stayed a long while each time.He scarcely ever
talks now while he is at work, but he often used to do.He'll sit for
hours alone at the little up-stairs window, looking towards the
ravine, and away over the mountains; he'll sit there all Sunday
afternoon, and often when it's moonlight he sits there till late in
the night.""Yes, of course, he reads and sings to me every Sunday; but he seems
rather in a hurry, save now and then when he gives almost too much of
the thing.""Does he never talk over matters with you then?""Well, yes; but it's so seldom that I sit and weep alone between
whiles.Then I dare say he notices it, for he begins talking, but
it's only about trifles; never about anything serious."The Clergyman walked up and down the room; then he stopped and asked,
"But why, then, don't you talk to him about his matters?"For a long while she gave no answer; she sighed several times, looked
downwards and sideways, doubled up her handkerchief, and at last
said, "I've come here to speak to you, father, about something that's
a great burden on my mind.""Speak freely; it will relieve you.""Yes, I know it will; for I've borne it alone now these many years,
and it grows heavier each year.""Well, what is it, my good Margit?"There was a pause, and then she said, "I've greatly sinned against my
son."The Clergyman came close to her; "Confess it," he
said; "and we will pray together that it may be forgiven."Margit sobbed and wiped her eyes, but began weeping again when she
tried to speak.The Clergyman tried to comfort her, saying she could
not have done anything very sinful, she doubtless was too hard upon
herself, and so on.But Margit continued weeping, and could not begin
her confession till the Clergyman seated himself by her side, and
spoke still more encouragingly to her.Then after a while she began,
"The boy was ill-used when a child; and so he got this mind for
travelling.Then he met with Christian--he who has grown so rich over
there where they dig gold.Christian gave him so many books that he
got quite a scholar; they used to sit together in the long evenings;
and when Christian went away Arne wanted to go after him.But just at
that time, the father died, and the lad promised never to leave me.But I was like a hen that's got a duck's egg to brood; when my
duckling had burst his shell, he would go out on the wide water, and
I was left on the bank, calling after him.If he didn't go away
himself, yet his heart went away in his songs, and every morning I
expected to find his bed empty."Then a letter from foreign parts came for him, and I felt sure it
must be from Christian.God forgive me, but I kept it back!I thought
there would be no more, but another came; and, as I had kept the
first, I thought I must keep the second, too.it seemed
as if they would burn a hole through the box where I had put them;
and my thoughts were there from as soon as I opened my eyes in the
morning till late at night when I shut them.And then,--did you ever
hear of anything worse!--a third letter came.I held it in my hand a
quarter of an hour; I kept it in my bosom three days, weighing in my
mind whether I should give it to him or put it with the others; but
then I thought perhaps it would lure him away from me, and so I
couldn't help putting it with the others.But now I felt miserable
every day, not only about the letters in the box, but also for fear
another might come.I was afraid of everybody who came to the house;
when we were sitting together inside, I trembled whenever I heard the
door go, for fear it might be somebody with a letter, and then he
might get it.When he was away in the parish, I went about at home
thinking he might perhaps get a letter while there, and then it would
tell him about those that had already come.When I saw him coming
home, I used to look at his face while he was yet a long way off,
and, oh, dear!how happy I felt when he smiled; for then I knew he
had got no letter.He had grown so handsome; like his father, only
fairer, and more gentle-looking.And, then, he had such a voice; when
he sat at the door in the evening-sun, singing towards the mountain
ridge, and listening to the echo, I felt that live without him.If I only saw him, or knew he was somewhere near, and he
seemed pretty happy, and would only give me a word now and then, I
wanted nothing more on earth, and I wouldn't have shed one tear
less."But just when he seemed to be getting on better with people, and
felt happier among them, there came a message from the post-office
that a fourth letter had come; and in it were two hundred dollars!I
thought I should have fell flat down where I stood: what could I do?The letter, I might get rid of, 'twas true; but the money?For two or
three nights I couldn't sleep for it; a little while I left it
up-stairs, then, in the cellar behind a barrel, and once I was so
overdone that I laid it in the window so that he might find it.But
when I heard him coming, I took it back again.At last, however, I
found a way: I gave him the money and told him it had been put out at
interest in my mother's lifetime.He laid it out upon the land, just
as I thought he would; and so it wasn't wasted.But that same
harvest-time, when he was sitting at home one evening, he began
talking about Christian, and wondering why he had so clean forgotten
him."Now again the wound opened, and the money burned me so that I was
obliged to go out of the room.I had sinned, and yet my sin had
answered no end.Since then, I have hardly dared to look into his
eyes, blessed as they are."The mother who has sinned against her own child is the most
miserable of all mothers;... and yet I did it only out of love....
And so, I dare say, I shall be punished accordingly by the loss of
what I love most.For since the middle of the winter, he has again
taken to singing the tune that he used to sing when he was longing to
go away; he has sung it ever since he was a lad, and whenever I hear
it I grow pale.Then I feel I could give up all for him; and only see
this."She took from her bosom a piece of paper, unfolded it and gave
it to the Clergyman."He now and then writes something here; I think
it's some words to that tune.... I brought it with me; for I can't
myself read such small writing... will you look and see if there
isn't something written about his going away...."

There was only one whole verse on the paper.For the second verse,
there were only a few half-finished lines, as if the song was one he
had forgotten, and was now coming into his memory again, line by
line.The first verse ran thus,--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
        Over the mountains high?Now I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine trees grow,
        Waiting and longing to rise
        Nearer the beckoning skies.""Yes, it is about that," replied the Clergyman, putting the paper
down.She sat with folded
hands, looking intently and anxiously into the Clergyman's face,
while tear after tear fell down her cheeks.The Clergyman knew no more what to do in the matter than she did."Well, I think the lad must be left alone in this case," he said."Life can't be made different for his sake; but what he will find in
it must depend upon himself; now, it seems, he wishes to go away in
search of life's good.""But isn't that just what the old crone did?""Yes; she who went away to fetch the sunshine, instead of making
windows in the wall to let it in."The Clergyman was much astonished at Margit's words, and so he had
been before, when she came speak to him on this subject; but,
indeed, she had thought of hardly anything else for eight years."Well, as to the letters, that wasn't quite right.Keeping back what
belonged to your son, can't be justified.But it was still worse to
make a fellow Christian appear in a bad light when he didn't deserve
it; and especially as he was one whom Arne was so fond of, and who
loved him so dearly in return.But we will pray God to forgive you;
we will both pray."Margit still sat with her hands folded, and her head bent down."How I should pray him to forgive me, if I only knew he would stay!"she said: surely, she was confounding our Lord with Arne.The
Clergyman, however, appeared as if he did not notice it."Do you intend to confess it to him directly?"She looked down, and said in a low voice, "I should much like to wait
a little if I dared."The Clergyman turned aside with a smile, and asked, "Don't you
believe your sin becomes greater, the longer you delay confessing
it?"She pulled her handkerchief about with both hands, folded it into a
very small square, and tried to fold it into a still smaller one, but
could not."If I confess about the letters, I'm afraid he'll go away.""Then, you dare not rely upon our Lord?""Oh, yes, I do, indeed," she said hurriedly; and then she added in a
low voice, "but still, if he were to go away from me?""Then, I see you are more afraid of his going away than of continuing
to sin?"Margit had unfolded her handkerchief again; and now she put it to her
eyes, for she began weeping.The Clergyman remained for a while
looking at her silently; then he went on, "Why, then, did you tell me
all this, if it was not to lead to anything?"He waited long, but she
did not answer."Perhaps you thought your sin would become less when
you had confessed it?""Yes, I did," she said, almost in a whisper, while her head bent
still lower upon her breast."Well, well, my good Margit, take
courage; I hope all will yet turn out for the best."she asked, looking up; and a sad smile passed over
her tear-marked face."Yes, I do; I believe God will no longer try you.You will have joy
in your old age, I am sure.""If I might only keep the joy I have!"she said; and the Clergyman
thought she seemed unable to fancy any greater happiness than living
in that constant anxiety."If we had but a little girl, now, who could take hold on him, then
I'm sure he would stay.""You may be sure I've thought of that," she said, shaking her head."Well, there's Eli Boeen; she might be one who would please him.""You may be sure I've thought of that."She rocked the upper part of
her body backwards and forwards."If we could contrive that they might oftener see each other here at
the parsonage?""You may be sure I've thought of that!"She clapped her hands and
looked at the Clergyman with a smile all over her face.He stopped
while he was lighting his pipe."Perhaps this, after all, was what brought you here to-day?"She looked down, put two fingers into the folded handkerchief, and
pulled out one corner of it."Ah, well, God help me, perhaps it was this I wanted."The Clergyman walked up and down, and smiled."Perhaps, too, you came
for the same thing the last time you were here?"She pulled out the corner of the handkerchief still farther, and
hesitated awhile."Well, as you ask me, perhaps I did--yes.""Then, too, it was to carry this point
that you confessed at last the thing you had on your conscience."She spread out the handkerchief to fold it up smoothly again."No;
ah, no; that weighed so heavily upon me, I felt I must tell it to
you, father.""Well, well, my dear Margit, we will talk no more about it."Then, while he was walking up and down, he suddenly added, "Do you
think you would of yourself have come out to me with this wish of
yours?""Well,--I had already come out with so much, that I dare say this,
too, would have come out at last."The Clergyman laughed, but he did not tell her what he thought."Well, we will manage this matter for you,
Margit," he said.She rose to go, for she understood he had now
said all he wished to say."And we will look after them a little.""I don't know how to thank you enough," she said, taking his hand and
courtesying.She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, went towards the door,
courtesied again, and said, "Good bye," while she slowly opened and
shut it.But so lightly as she went towards Kampen that day, she had
not gone for many, many years.When she had come far enough to see
the thick smoke curling up cheerfully from the chimney, she blessed
the house, the whole place, the Clergyman and Arne,--and remembered
they were going to have her favorite dish, smoked ham, for dinner.It was situated in the middle of a
plain, bordered on the one side by a ravine, and on the other, by the
high-road; just beyond the road was a thick wood, with a mountain
ridge rising behind it, while high above all stood blue mountains
crowned with snow.On the other side of the ravine also was a wide
range of mountains, running round the Swart-water on the side where
Boeen was situated: it grew higher as it ran towards Kampen, but then
turned suddenly sidewards, forming the broad valley called the
Lower-tract, which began here, for Kampen was the last place in the
Upper-tract.The front door of the dwelling-house opened towards the road, which
was about two thousand paces off, and a path with leafy birch-trees
on both sides led thither.In front of the house was a little garden,
which Arne managed according to the rules given in his books.The
cattle-houses and barns were nearly all new-built, and stood to the
left hand, forming a square.The house was two stories high, and was
painted red, with white window-frames and doors; the roof was of turf
with many small plants growing upon it, and on the ridge was a
vane-spindle, where turned an iron cock with a high raised tail.Spring had come to the mountain-tracts.It was Sunday morning; the
weather was mild and calm, but the air was somewhat heavy, and the
mist lay low on the forest, though Margit said it would rise later in
the day.Arne had read the sermon, and sung the hymns to his mother,
and he felt better for them himself.Now he stood ready dressed to go
to the parsonage.When he opened the door the fresh smell of the
leaves met him; the garden lay dewy and bright in the morning breeze,
but from the ravine sounded the roaring of the waterfall, now in
lower, then again in louder booms, till all around seemed to tremble.As he went farther from the fall, its booming
became less awful, and soon it lay over the landscape like the deep
tones of an organ.the mother said, opening the
window and looking after him till he disappeared behind the shrubs.The mist had gradually risen, the sun shone bright, the fields and
garden became full of fresh life, and the things Arne had sown and
tended grew and sent up odor and gladness to his mother."Spring is
beautiful to those who have had a long winter," she said, looking
away over the fields, as if in thought.Arne had no positive errand at the parsonage, but he thought he might
go there to ask about the newspapers which he shared with the
Clergyman.Recently he had read the names of several Norwegians who
had been successful in gold digging in America, and among them was
Christian.His relations had long since left the place, but Arne had
lately heard a rumor that they expected him to come home soon.About
this, also, Arne thought he might hear at the parsonage; and if
Christian had already returned, he would go down and see him between
spring and hay-harvest.These thoughts occupied his mind till he came
far enough to see the Swart-water and Boeen on the other side.There,
too, the mist had risen, but it lay lingering on the mountain-sides,
while their peaks rose clear above, and the sunbeams played on the
plain; on the right hand, the shadow of the wood darkened the water,
but before the houses the lake had strewed its white sand on the flat
shore.All at once, Arne fancied himself in the red-painted house
with the white doors and windows, which he had taken as a model for
his own.He did not think of those first gloomy days he had passed
there, but only of that summer they both saw--he and Eli--up beside
her sick-bed.He had not been there since; nor would he have gone for
the whole world.If his thoughts but touched on that time, he turned
crimson; yet he thought of it many times a day; and if anything could
have driven him away from the parish, it was this.He strode onwards, as if to flee from his thoughts; but the farther
he went, the nearer he came to Boeen, and the more he looked at it.The mist had disappeared, the sky shone bright between the frame of
mountains, the birds floated in the sunny air, calling to each other,
and the fields laughed with millions of flowers; here no thundering
waterfall bowed the gladness to submissive awe, but full of life it
gambolled and sang without check or pause.Arne walked till he became glowing hot; then he threw himself down on
the grass beneath the shadow of a hill and looked towards Boeen, but
he soon turned away again to avoid seeing it.Then he heard a song
above him, so wonderfully clear as he had never heard a song before.It came floating over the meadows, mingled with the chattering of the
birds, and he had scarcely recognized the tune ere he recognized the
words also: the tune was the one he loved better than any; the words
were those he had borne in his mind ever since he was a boy, and had
forgotten that same day they were brought forth.He sprang up as if
he would catch them, but then stopped and listened while verse after
verse came streaming down to him:--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
      Over the mountains high?Now, I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine-trees grow,
      Waiting and longing to rise
      Nearer the beckoning skies."Th' eagle is rising afar away,
      Over the mountains high,
    Rowing along in the radiant day
    With mighty strokes to his distant prey,
      Where he will, swooping downwards,
      Where he will, sailing onwards."Apple-tree, longest thou not to go
      Over the mountains high?Gladly thou growest in summer's glow,
    Patiently waitest through winter's snow:
      Though birds on thy branches swing,
      Thou knowest not what they sing."He who has twenty years longed to flee
      Over the mountains high--
    He who beyond them, never will see,
    Smaller, and smaller, each year must be:
      He hears what the birds, say
      While on thy boughs they play."Birds, with your chattering, why did ye come
      Over the mountains high?Beyond, in a sunnier land ye could roam,
    And nearer to heaven could build your home;
      Why have ye come to bring
      Longing, without your wing?"Shall I, then, never, never flee
      Over the mountains high?Rocky walls, will ye always be
    Prisons until ye are tombs for me?--
      Until I lie at your feet
      Wrapped in my winding-sheet?I will away, afar away,
      Over the mountains high!Here, I am sinking lower each day,
    Though my Spirit has chosen the loftiest way;
      Let her in freedom fly;
      Not, beat on the walls and die!"_Once_, I know, I shall journey far
      Over the mountains high.Lord, is thy door already ajar?--
    Dear is the home where thy saved ones are;--
      But bar it awhile from me,
      And help me to long for Thee."Arne stood listening till the sound of the last verse, the last words
died away; then he heard the birds sing and play again, but he dared
not move.Yet he must find out who had been singing, and he lifted
his foot and walked on, so carefully that he did not hear the grass
rustle.A little butterfly settled on a flower at his feet, flew up
and settled a little way before him, flew up and settled again, and
so on all over the hill.But soon he came to a thick bush and
stopped; for a bird flew out of it with a frightened "quitt, quitt!"and rushed away over the sloping hill-side.Then she who was sitting
there looked up; Arne stooped low down, his heart throbbed till he
heard its beats, he held his breath, and was afraid to stir a leaf;
for it was Eli whom he saw.After a long while he ventured to look up again; he wished to draw
nearer, but he thought the bird perhaps had its nest under the bush,
and he was afraid he might tread on it.Then he peeped between the
leaves as they blew aside and closed again.She wore a close-fitting black dress with long white sleeves,
and a straw hat like those worn by boys.In her lap a book was lying
with a heap of wild flowers upon it; her right hand was listlessly
playing with them as if she were in thought, and her left supported
her head.She was looking away towards the place where the bird had
flown, and she seemed as if she had been weeping.Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or dreamed of in all
his life; the sun, too, had spread its gold over her and the place;
and the song still hovered round her, so that Arne thought,
breathed--nay, even his heart beat, in time with it.It seemed so
strange that the song which bore all his longing, _he_ had forgotten,
but _she_ had found.A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times, till at last she
saw it and frightened it away with a flower-stalk, which she put up
as often as it came before her.Then she took up the book and opened
it, but she soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song.He could hear it was "The Tree's early leaf-buds,"
though she often made mistakes, as if she did not quite remember
either the words or the tune.The verse she knew best was the last
one, and so she often repeated it; but she sang it thus:--

   "The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:
    'May I gather thy berries?''Yes; all thou canst see;
        Take them; all are for thee.'Said the Tree--trala--lala, trala, lala--said."Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers around her,
and sang till the tune trembled through the air, and might have been
heard at Boeen.Arne had thought of coming forwards when she began
singing; he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he felt
he _must_ come, but she went away.No!--There she skipped over the hillocks singing; here her hat fell
off, there she took it up again; here she picked a flower, there she
stood deep in the highest grass.It was a long while ere he ventured to peep out
again; at first he only raised his head; he could not see her: he
rose to his knees; still he could not see her: he stood upright; no
she was gone.He thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his mind.Now he would not go to the parsonage.He would not have the
newspapers; would not know anything about Christian.He would not go
home; he would go nowhere; he would do nothing."Oh, God, I am so unhappy!"He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds" till the
mountains resounded.Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and took up the flowers
she had picked, but he flung them away again down the hill on every
side.It was long since he had done so; this struck
him, and made him weep still more.He would go far away, that he
would; no, he would not go away!He thought he was very unhappy; but
when he asked himself why, he could hardly tell.It
was a lovely day; and the Sabbath rest lay over all.The lake was
without a ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling, and though
the little birds continued their twittering, they went towards the
shade of the wood; the dewdrops were gone, and the grass looked
grave; not a breath of wind stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun
was near the meridian.Almost before he knew, he found himself seated
putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;
and while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune
went and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be
sung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:

   "He went in the forest the whole day long,
    The whole day long;
    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,
    A wondrous song."He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,
    A willow spray,
    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,
    The sweet tune lay."It whispered and told him its name at last,
    Its name at last;
    But then, while he listened, away it passed,
    Away it passed."But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,
    Again it stole,
    With touches of love upon his soul,
    Upon his soul."Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,
    And keep it fast;
    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,
    I' the night it passed."'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,
    In the night, I pray;
    For the tune has taken my heart away,
    My heart away.'"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,
    It is thy friend,
    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,
    Thy longing end;

   "'And all the others are nothing to thee,
    Nothing to thee,
    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,
    Never shalt see.'"SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME."Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday
evening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from
church, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock."Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.She hurried
down the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen
playing there with her brother and the Clergyman's son."Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God bless you all."She blushed crimson and wanted to leave
off the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them
to let her go for that evening."I almost think I know you," said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother."Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck
and shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom
fluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed
because she was so out of breath."Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling happy as
she looked at her."P'r'aps you don't know me?"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her
name, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her
before."No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps
you know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother," said Margit, with a
stolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly."I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.""It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in
before I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.""There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli suggested."Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I
suppose?""Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have
plenty of help."Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to
talk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on."Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing
anybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways."Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a
dress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower
hooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little
turned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape
of a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore
the first time Margit danced with him."A pretty stud," she said, looking at it."Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and
Margit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask
also about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen."The farm has improved very much these last few years,
and it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows
now, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a
first-rate way."Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then
asked her age."Have you helped in the house-work?Not much, I dare say--you look so
spruce."Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late."Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when
one gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before
her, why, it doesn't matter so much."Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond
the grounds of the parsonage."It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would
chat a little longer with me."Then Margit began to talk about Arne."I don't know if you know much
of him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear
me, what a deal he has read!"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal."Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but
the way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something
more, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his
mother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to
complain of."Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint."Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be
rewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she
ought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar."I only dropped a little twig I had."I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit
alone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings
blessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad
that day."They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;
but soon Eli stopped."One of my shoe-strings has come down."Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied."He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got cowed while he was
a child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything
by himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli
must see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late
that day."There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.""No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back."Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but there's sure to be
somebody else about;" and Eli had now less objection to it."If only I shall not be too late," she said."Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too
late, I dare say.""Being brought up at the
Clergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?""It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less."No; that, Eli thought she would never have."Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still
folks about here haven't much learning."Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her."No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come
farther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is
Kampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;
but that doesn't matter much, after all."Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood."It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named
Opplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him
that piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be
lonely."Soon they came far enough to see Kampen."Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun
shone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked
down over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house
with its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the
pale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in
stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep
and goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and
the milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of
the waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this
filled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it
whizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that
she unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that
Margit begged her to come on a little faster."I never
heard anything like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened.""You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.""Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said, turning
downwards from the road, into the path."Those trees on each side,
Nils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so
does Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out."exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden
fence."We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now we must go over to
look at the creatures before they're locked in--" But Eli did not
hear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking
at it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a
furtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as
they passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by
one to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would
calve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs
which Arne had got from the South."He aims at all such things," said
Margit, "though one wouldn't think it of him."Then they went into
the barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli
had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found everywhere," Margit
said.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what
kind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind."No less
than three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're
set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,
the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for
there he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it
for manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes
here will find things in good order, I'm sure."Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all
that Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the
garden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,
she begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little
garden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try
it, for she rose directly."Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late," said Margit, as
she stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli
would not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had
been at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they
looked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother
generally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and
pleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock
and a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but
with new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English
fishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and
showed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was
without painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any
in the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the
green mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the
background.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;
for in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne
brought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and
so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name
was painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable
and unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and
now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; "all the best
things were there," the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but
they were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked
towards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household
things not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and
other bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;
so did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of
them twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while
more interested."Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the mother, taking it
from under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it
looked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the
waterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the
spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one
place farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it
just where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into
the depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with
fresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had
grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and
twisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had
not a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled
and bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When
Eli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;
next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green
mountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to
the room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the
Clergyman had more.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his
money.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and
if everything went right they would have some more."But, after all,
money's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better
still," she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to
see, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother
showed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,
were taken out and looked at."I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,
my child," she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had
scarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by
the hand and said in a low voice, "Look at that little red chest;
there's something very choice in that, you may be sure."Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she
thought she would very much like to have."He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest," the mother
whispered; "and he always hides the key."She went to some clothes
that hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the
pocket, and there found the key."Now come and look," she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt
down before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an
odor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen
anything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away."Here, look," she whispered, taking out a fine black
silk neckerchief such as men do not wear."It looks just as if it
was meant for a girl," the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap
and looked at it, but did not say a word."Here's one more," the
mother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother
insisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her
head down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a
neckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They
folded them up again, but slowly."Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands."Everything seems as if it was for a girl."Eli blushed crimson, but
she said nothing."There's some more things yet," said the mother,
taking out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,
her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she
would fain have turned away, but that she could not well do."He has bought something every time he has been to town," continued
the mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from
one thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and
her face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything
like them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they
could be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her
fingers left warm marks on them."I'm hot, I think," she whispered."Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after
another, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?""He has kept them here in this chest--so long."She
laid them all in the chest again, just as they were before."Now
we'll see what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the lid
carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially
beautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,
two gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and
with silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver
of the book she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Boeen."The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,
but saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and
spreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her
hand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without
either of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *

A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the
mother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for
now Arne would soon be at home.Then she came out in the garden to
Eli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw
Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;
but she had been weeping."There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit, caressing her;
"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne," she added, as a black
figure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was
nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not
look at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat
down on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,
and Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the
door and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,
but then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the
wall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines
into the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but
then bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,
but wept still more.She leant
her head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she
did not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save
that of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant
and subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;
Arne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then."Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne," she said,
coming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her
good, she said.*       *       *       *       *

Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and
Arne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of
those light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd
together, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been
accustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and
goes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but
not life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out
between the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to
hear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,
which is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and
thinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they
felt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be
taken from them."I can hardly believe it," Arne said."I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily before her."_Yet it's true_," he said, laying stress on each word; "now I am no
longer going about only thinking; for once I have done something."He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly."No, it
was not I," he said; "it was mother who did it."He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,
"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, "God be thanked
that I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to
see many things which would not have been as they ought...." Then
after a while he added, "But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I
should have gone on alone for ever.""What do you think father will say, dear?"asked Eli, who had been
busy with her own thoughts."I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning," said
Arne;--"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself," he added, determining
he would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things
again; no, never!"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the
nut-wood?""And the tune I had made it for, you got hold
of, too.""I took the one which suited it," she said, looking down.He smiled
joyfully and bent his face down to hers."But the other song you did not know?"she asked looking up....

"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...
yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill."She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed."Then, after all,
you have been served just right," she said."Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well
... another time...."

"Nay; tell it me now."She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, "Surely, you haven't
been up-stairs?"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked
down."Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep
back her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her
still closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his
eyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but
could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned
aside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange
shapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat
with two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was
the nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the
picture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly
rent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the
cliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to
move; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke
and twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and
then from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept
once more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness
lying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words
himself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that
she might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It
was a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in
morning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards
the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while
the women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the
stern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards
Boeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Boeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces
of cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new
clothes, and looking distantly at each other; an old woman sat lonely
and weeping on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.She
wore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the
upper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on
their wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering
refreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in
Eli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who
had come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was
dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar
that Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,
standing at the window where she wrote "Arne."It was open, and he
leant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the
distant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in
the day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,
where he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye
came, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his
fair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a
quiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had
just come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was
tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but
with a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew
to one side.Each had something to say to
the other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more
embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned
towards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, "Perhaps you'll
come too."Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long
while about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking
out from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took
from his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of
wine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though
he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank
some himself, but offered it to her several times while he was
drinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the
cup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, "I'm so
happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long
while since I did so."Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went
on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated
us two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone
farther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken
into our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,
if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so
that we can never more be separated?"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head
down upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no
answer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice
asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"Birgit raised her
head, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face."Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave
her hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but
they clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty
years.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to
the door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard
looked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and
followed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the
rowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said
how strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad."Ah,
whether it wishes to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all
along the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife."Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE

anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and we have no
fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of some wisdom
and much amusement.By this single 'Lemon' we judge of the rest.""This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth, and as
such, it will be useful in driving dull care away.""It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become all the
better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until now never
had a local habitation and a name.""For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or more likely
to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or study.""You are a wonderfully wise person," retorted the sprite."How on earth
is Fortyforefoot to show his tricks if we tie his hands?""By means of his tricks," returned the major."If he is any kind of a
magician he'll get his hands free in less than a minute.""I'm not good at
conundrums," said the major."I'm sure I don't know," returned the sprite, impatiently."Then why waste time asking riddles to which you don't know the answer?""You'll have me mad in a minute, and when I'm mad woe
be unto him which I'm angry at.""Don't quarrel," said Jimmieboy, stepping between his two friends, with
whom it seemed to be impossible to keep peace for any length of time."If you quarrel I shall leave you both and go back to my company."But he
mustn't do it again.Now as you have chosen to reject my plan of
attacking Fortyforefoot and tying his hands, suppose you suggest
something better, Mr."I think the safe thing would be for Jimmieboy to wear this invisible
coat of mine when in the giant's presence.If Fortyforefoot can't see
him he is safe," said the sprite."I don't see any invisible coat anywhere," said the major."Nobody can see it, of course," said the sprite, scornfully."Yes, I do," retorted the major."I only pretended I didn't so that I
could make you ask the question, which enables me to say that something
invisible is something you can't see, like your jokes.""I can make a better joke than you can with my hands tied behind my
back," snapped the sprite."I can't make jokes with your hands tied behind your back, but I can
make one with my own hands tied behind my back that Jimmieboy here can
see with his eyes shut," said the major, scornfully."Why--er--let me see; why--er--when is a sunbeam sharp?"asked the
major, who did not expect to be taken up so quickly."Bad as can be," said the sprite, his nose turned up until it interfered
with his eyesight.When is a joke not a
joke?""Haven't the slightest idea," observed Jimmieboy, after scratching his
head and trying to think for a minute or two."When it's one of the major's," roared the sprite, whereat the woods
rang with his laughter.The major first turned pale and then grew red in the face."That settles it," he said, throwing off his coat."That is a deadly
insult, and there is now no possible way to avoid a duel.""I am ready for you at any time," said the sprite, calmly."Only as the
challenged party I have the choice of weapons, and inasmuch as this is a
hot day, I choose the jawbone."said the major, with a gesture of
impatience.We will
withdraw to that moss-covered rock underneath the trees in there, gather
enough huckleberries and birch bark for our luncheon, and catch a mess
of trout from the brook to go with them, and then we can fight our duel
all the rest of the afternoon.""But how's that going to satisfy my wounded honor?""I'll tell one story," said the sprite, "and you'll tell another, and
when we are through, the one that Jimmieboy says has told the best story
will be the victor.That is better than trying to hurt each other, I
think.""I think so too," put in Jimmieboy."Well, it isn't a bad scheme," agreed the major."Particularly the
luncheon part of it; so you may count on me.I've got a story that will
lift your hair right off your head."So Jimmieboy and his two strange friends retired into the wood, gathered
the huckleberries and birch bark, caught, cooked, and ate the trout, and
then sat down together on the moss-covered rock to fight the duel.The
two fighters drew lots to find out which should tell the first story,
and as the sprite was the winner, he began."When I was not more than a thousand years old--" said the sprite."That was nine thousand years
ago--before this world was made.I celebrated my
ten-thousand-and-sixteenth birthday last Friday--but that has nothing to
do with my story.When I was not more than a thousand years of age, my
parents, who occupied a small star about forty million miles from here,
finding that my father could earn a better living if he were located
nearer the moon, moved away from my birthplace and rented a good-sized,
four-pronged star in the suburbs of the great orb of night.In the old
star we were too far away from the markets for my father to sell the
products of his farm for anything like what they cost him; freight
charges were very heavy, and often the stage-coach that ran between
Twinkleville and the moon would not stop at Twinkleville at all, and
then all the stuff that we had raised that week would get stale, lose
its fizz, and have to be thrown away.""Let me beg your pardon again," put in the major."But what did you
raise on your farm?I never heard of farm products having fizz to lose.""We raised soda-water chiefly," returned the sprite, amiably."Soda-water and suspender buttons.The soda-water was cultivated and the
suspender buttons seemed to grow wild.We never knew exactly how; though
from what I have learned since about them, I think I begin to understand
the science of it; and I wish now that I could find a way to return to
Twinkleville, because I am certain it must be a perfect treasure-house
of suspender buttons by this time.Even in my day they used to lie about
by the million--metallic buttons every one of them.They must be worth
to-day at least a dollar a thousand.""What is your idea about the way they happened to come there, based on
what you have learned since?""Well, it is a very simple idea," returned the sprite."You know when a
suspender button comes off it always disappears.Of course it must go
somewhere, but the question is, where?No one has ever yet been known to
recover the suspender button he has once really lost; and my notion of
it is simply that the minute a metal suspender button comes off the
clothes of anybody in all the whole universe, it immediately flies up
through the air and space to Twinkleville, which is nothing more than a
huge magnet, and lies there until somebody picks it up and tries to sell
it.I remember as a boy sweeping our back yard clear of them one
evening, and waking the next morning to find the whole place covered
with them again; but we never could make money on them, because the moon
was our sole market, and only the best people of the moon ever used
suspenders, and as these were unfortunately relatives of ours, we had to
give them all the buttons they wanted for nothing, so that the button
crops became rather an expense to us than otherwise.But with soda-water
it was different.Everybody, it doesn't make any difference where he
lives, likes soda-water, and it was an especially popular thing in the
moon, where the plain water is always so full of fish that nobody can
drink it.But as I said before, often the stage-coach wouldn't or
couldn't stop, and we found ourselves getting poorer every day.Finally
my father made up his mind to lease, and move into this new star, sink a
half-dozen soda-water wells there, and by means of a patent he owned,
which enabled him to give each well a separate and distinct flavor,
drive everybody else out of the business.""You don't happen to remember how that patent your father owned worked,
do you?"asked the major, noticing that Jimmieboy seemed particularly
interested when the sprite mentioned this."If you do, I'd like to buy
the plan of it from you and give it to Jimmieboy for a Christmas
present, so that he can have soda-water wells in his own back yard at
home.""No, I can't remember anything about it," said the sprite."Nine
thousand years is a long time to remember things of that kind, though I
don't think the scheme was a very hard one to work.For vanilla cream,
it only required a well with plain soda-water in it with a quart of
vanilla beans and three pints of cream poured into it four times a week;
same way with other flavors--a quart of strawberries for strawberry,
sarsaparilla for sarsaparilla, and so forth; but the secret was in the
pouring; there was something in the way papa did the pouring; I never
knew just what it was.But if you don't stop asking questions I'll never finish my story.""You shouldn't make it so interesting if you don't want us to have our
curiosity excited by it," said Jimmieboy."I'd have asked those
questions if the major hadn't."Well, we moved, and in a very short time were comfortably settled in
the suburban star I have mentioned," continued the sprite."As we
expected, my father grew very, very rich.He was referred to in the moon
newspapers as 'The Soda-water King,' and once an article about him said
that he owned the finest suspender-button mine in the universe, which
was more or less true, but which, as it turned out, was unfortunate in
its results.Some moon people hearing of his ownership of the
Twinkleville Button Mines came to him and tried to persuade him that
they ought to be worked.Father said he didn't see any use of it,
because the common people didn't wear suspenders, and so didn't need the
buttons."'True,' said they, 'but we can compel them to need them, by making a
law requiring that everybody over sixteen shall wear suspenders.'"'That's a good idea,' said my father, and he tried to have it made a
law that every one should wear suspenders, high or low, and as a result
he got everybody mad at him.The best people were angry, because up to
that time the wearing of suspenders had been regarded as a sign of noble
birth, and if everybody, including the common people, were to have them
they would cease to be so.The common people themselves were angry,
because to have to buy suspenders would simply be an addition to the
cost of living, and they hadn't any money to spare.In consequence we
were cut off by the best people of the moon.Nobody ever came to see us
except the very commonest kind of common people, and they came at night,
and then only to drop pailfuls of cod-liver oil, squills, ipecac, and
other unpopular things into our soda-water wells, so that in a very
short time my poor father's soda-water business was utterly ruined.People don't like to order ten quarts of vanilla cream soda-water for
Sunday dinner, and find it flavored with cod-liver oil, you know.""Yes, I do know," said Jimmieboy, screwing his face up in an endeavor to
give the major and the sprite some idea of how little he liked the taste
of cod-liver oil."I think cod-liver oil is worse than measles or
mumps, because you can't have measles or mumps more than once, and there
isn't any end to the times you can have cod-liver oil.""I'm with you there," said the major, emphasizing his remark by slapping
Jimmieboy on the back."In fact, sir, on page 29 of my book called
'Musings on Medicines' you will find--if it is ever published--these
lines:

          "The oils of cod!They make me feel tremendous odd,
           Nor hesitate
           I here to state
     I wildly hate the oils of cod.""When I start my autograph album I want you
to write those lines on the first page.""Never, I hope," replied the sprite, with a chuckle."And now suppose
you don't interrupt my story again."Clouds began to gather on the major's face again.The sprite's rebuke
had evidently made him very angry."Sir," said he, as soon as his feelings permitted him to speak."If you
make any more such remarks as that, another duel may be necessary after
this one is fought--which I should very much regret, for duels of this
sort consume a great deal of time, and unless I am much mistaken it will
shortly rain cats and dogs.""It looks that way," said the sprite, "and it is for that very reason
that I do not wish to be interrupted again.Of course ruin stared father
in the face."whispered the major to Jimmieboy, who immediately
silenced him."Trade having fallen away," continued the sprite, "we had to draw upon
our savings for our bread and butter, and finally, when the last penny
was spent, we made up our minds to leave the moon district entirely and
try life on the dog-star, where, we were informed, people only had one
eye apiece, and every man had so much to do that it took all of his one
eye's time looking after his own business so that there wasn't any left
for him to spend on other people's business.It seemed to my father that
in a place like this there was a splendid opening for him.""Renting out his extra eye to blind men," roared the sprite.Jimmieboy fell off the rock with laughter, and the major, angry at being
so neatly caught, rose up and walked away but immediately returned."If this wasn't a duel I wouldn't stay here another minute," he said."But you can't put me to flight that way."The question now came up as to how we should get to the dog-star,"
resumed the sprite."I should think they'd have been so glad you were leaving they'd have
paid your fare," said the major, but the sprite paid no attention."There was no regular stage line between the moon and the dog-star,"
said he, "and we had only two chances of really getting there, and they
were both so slim you could count their ribs.One was by getting aboard
the first comet that was going that way, and the other was by jumping.The trouble with the first chance was that as far as any one knew there
wasn't a comet expected to go in the direction of the dog-star for eight
million years--which was rather a long time for a starving family to
wait, and besides we had read of so many accidents in the moon papers
about people being injured while trying to board comets in motion that
we were a little timid about it.My father and I could have managed
very well; but mother might not have--ladies can't even get on horse
cars in motion without getting hurt, you know.It's a pretty big jump
from the moon to the dog-star, and if you don't aim yourself right you
are apt to miss it, and either fall into space or land somewhere else
where you don't want to go.For instance, a cousin of mine
who lived on Mars wanted to visit us when we lived at Twinkleville, but
he was too mean to pay his fare, thinking he could jump it cheaper.Well, he jumped and where do you suppose he landed?"He didn't come
anywhere near Twinkleville, although he supposed that he was aimed in
the right direction.""Will you tell me how you know he's falling yet?"asked the major, who
didn't seem to believe this part of the sprite's story.I saw him yesterday through a telescope," replied the
sprite."And he looked very tired, too," said the sprite."Though as a matter of
fact he doesn't have to exert himself any.All he has to do is fall,
and, once you get started, falling is the easiest thing in the world.But of course with the remembrance of my cousin's mistake in our minds,
we didn't care so much about making the jump, and we kept putting it off
and putting it off until finally some wretched people had a law made
abolishing us from the moon entirely, which meant that we had to leave
inside of twenty-four hours; so we packed up our trunks with the few
possessions we had left and threw them off toward the dog-star; then
mother and father took hold of hands and jumped and I was to come along
after them with some of the baggage that we hadn't got ready in time."According to my father's instructions I watched him carefully as he
sped through space to see whether he had started right, and to my great
joy I observed that he had--that very shortly both he and mother would
arrive safely on the dog-star--but alas!My joy was soon turned to
grief, for a terrible thing happened.Our great heavy family trunk that
had been dispatched first, and with truest aim, landed on the head of
the King of the dog-star, stove his crown in and nearly killed him.Hardly had the king risen up from the ground when he was again knocked
down by my poor father, who, utterly powerless to slow up or switch
himself to one side, landed precisely as the trunk had landed on the
monarch's head, doing quite as much more damage as the trunk had done in
the beginning.When added to these mishaps a shower of hat-boxes and
hand-bags, marked with our family name, fell upon the Lord Chief
Justice, the Prime Minister and the Heir Apparent, my parents were
arrested and thrown into prison and I decided that the dog-star was no
place for me.Wild with grief, and without looking to see where I was
going, nor in fact caring much, I gave a running leap out into space and
finally through some good fortune landed here on this earth which I have
found quite good enough for me ever since."Here the sprite paused and looked at Jimmieboy as much as to say, "How
is that for a tale of adventure?"cried the major, "Isn't it enough?"I don't see how he could have jumped
so many years before the world was made and yet land on the world.""I was five thousand years on the jump," explained the sprite."It was leap-year when you started, wasn't it?"asked the major, with a
sarcastic smile.asked Jimmieboy,
signaling the major to be quiet.I am afraid they got into serious
trouble.It's a very serious thing to knock a king down with a trunk and
land on his head yourself the minute he gets up again," sighed the
sprite."But didn't you tell me your parents were unfairies?"put in Jimmieboy,
eying the sprite distrustfully."Yes; but they were only my adopted parents," explained the sprite."They were a very rich old couple with lots of money and no children, so
I adopted them not knowing that they were unfairies.When they died they
left me all their bad habits, and their money went to found a storeroom
for worn out lawn-mowers."Well that's a pretty good story," said Jimmieboy."Yes," said the sprite, with a pleased smile."And the best part of it
is it's all true."CHAPTER X.

THE MAJOR'S TALE."A great many years ago when I was a souvenir spoon," said the major, "I
belonged to a very handsome and very powerful potentate.""I didn't quite understand what it was you said you were," said the
sprite, bending forward as if to hear better."At the beginning of my story I was a souvenir spoon," returned the
major."Did you begin your career as a spoon?""I did not, sir," replied the major."I began my career as a nugget in a
lead mine where I was found by the king of whom I have just spoken, and
on his return home with me he gave me to his wife who sent me out to a
lead smith's and had me made over into a souvenir spoon--and a mighty
handsome spoon I was too.I had a poem engraved on me that said:

    'Aka majo te roo li sah,
     Pe mink y rali mis tebah.'Rather pretty thought, don't you think so?"added the major as he
completed the couplet.said the sprite, with a knowing shake of his head."Well, I don't understand it at all," said Jimmieboy."Ask this native of Twinkleville what it means," observed the major with
a snicker."He says it's a pretty thought, so of course he understands
it--though I assure you I don't, for it doesn't mean anything.I made it
up, this very minute."It was quite evident that he had fallen into
the trap the major had set for him."I was only fooling," he said, with a sickly attempt at a smile."I think perhaps the happiest time of my life was during the hundreds of
years that I existed in the royal museum as a spoon," resumed the major."I was brought into use only on state occasions.When the King of
Mangapore gave a state banquet to other kings in the neighborhood I was
the spoon that was used to ladle out the royal broth."Here the major paused to smack his lips, and then a small tear appeared
in one corner of his eye and trickled slowly down the side of his nose."I always weep," he said, as soon as he could speak, "when I think of
that broth.Here is what it was made of:

    'Seven pies of sweetest mince,
     Then a ripe and mellow quince,
         Then a quart of tea.Then a pint of cinnamon,
     Next a roasted apple, done
         Brown as brown can be.Add of orange juice, a gill,
     And a sugared daffodil,
         Then a yellow yam.Sixty-seven strawberries
     Should be added then to these,
         And a pot of jam.Mix with maple syrup and
     Let it in the ice-box stand
         Till it's good and cold--
     Throw a box of raisins in,
     Stir it well--just make it spin--
         Till it looks like gold.'"What a dish it was, and I, I used to be
dipped into a tureen full of it sixteen times at every royal feast,
and before the war we had royal feasts on an average of three times
a day."cried Jimmieboy, his mouth watering to
think of it."Three a day until the unhappy war broke out
which destroyed all my happiness, and resulted in the downfall of
sixty-four kings.""How on earth did such a war as that ever happen to be fought?""I am sorry to say," replied the major, sadly, "that I was the innocent
cause of it all.It was on the king's birthday that war was declared.He
used to have magnificent birthday parties, quite like those that boys
like Jimmieboy here have, only instead of having a cake with a candle in
it for each year, King Fuzzywuz used to have one guest for each year,
and one whole cake for each guest.On his twenty-first birthday he had
twenty-one guests; on his thirtieth, thirty, and so on; and at every one
of these parties I used to be passed around to be admired, I was so very
handsome and valuable."said the sprite, with a sneering laugh."The idea of a lead
spoon being valuable!""If you had ever been able to get into the society of kings," the major
answered, with a great deal of dignity, "you would know that on the
table of a monarch lead is much more rare than silver and gold.It was
this fact that made me so overpoweringly valuable, and it is not
surprising that a great many of the kings who used to come to these
birthday parties should become envious of Fuzzywuz and wish they owned a
treasure like myself.One very old king died of envy because of me, and
his heir-apparent inherited his father's desire to possess me to such a
degree that he too pined away and finally disappeared entirely.Didn't die, you know, as you would, but
vanished."So it went on for years, and finally on his sixty-fourth birthday King
Fuzzywuz gave his usual party, and sixty-four of the choicest kings in
the world were invited.They every one came, the feast was made ready,
and just as the guests took their places around the table, the broth
with me lying at the side of the tureen was brought in.The kings all
took their crowns off in honor of my arrival, when suddenly pouf!a gust
of wind came along and blew out every light in the hall.All was
darkness, and in the midst of it I felt myself grabbed by the handle and
shoved hastily into an entirely strange pocket.'Turn off the wind and bring
a light.'"The slaves hastened to do as they were told, and in less time than it
takes to tell it, light and order were restored.I could see it very plainly through a button-hole in the
cloak of the potentate who had seized me and hidden me in his pocket.Fuzzywuz immediately discovered that I was missing.he roared to the head-waiter,
who, though he was an African of the blackest hue, turned white as a
sheet with fear."'It was in the broth, oh, Nepotic Fuzzywuz, King of the Desert and most
noble Potentate of the Sand Dunes, when I, thy miserable servant,
brought it into the gorgeous banqueting hall and set it here before
thee, who art ever my most Serene and Egotistic Master,' returned the
slave, trembling with fear and throwing himself flat upon the
dining-hall floor.Do
spoons take wings unto themselves and fly away?Are they tadpoles that
they develop legs and hop as frogs from our royal presence?Do spoons
evapidate----'

"'Evaporate, my dear,' suggested the queen in a whisper.'Do spoons evaporate like water in the
sun?Do they raise sails like sloops of war and thunder noiselessly out
of sight?Thou hast stolen it and thou must bear the penalty of
thy predilection----'

"'Dereliction,' whispered the queen, impatiently."'He knows what I mean,' roared the king, 'or if he doesn't he will when
his head is cut off.'""Is that what all those big words meant?""As I remember the occurrence, it is," returned the major."What the
king really meant was always uncertain; he always used such big words
and rarely got them right.Reprehensibility and tremulousness were great
favorites of his, though I don't believe he ever knew what they meant.But, to continue my story, at this point the king rose and sharpening
the carving knife was about to behead the slave's head off when the
potentate who had me in his pocket cried out:

"'Hold, oh Fuzzywuz!I saw the spoon myself at the
side of yon tureen when it was brought hither.'"'Then,' returned the king, 'it has been percolated----'

"'Peculated,' whispered the queen."'That's what I said,' retorted Fuzzywuz, angrily.'The spoon has been
speculated by some one of our royal brethren at this board.The point to
be liquidated now is, who has done this deed.A
guard about the palace gates--and lock the doors and bar the windows.I am sorry to say, that every king in this room
save only myself and my friend Prince Bigaroo, who at the risk of his
kingly dignity deigned to come to the rescue of my slave, must repeal--I
should say reveal--the contents of his pockets.Prince Bigaroo must be
innocent or he would not have ejaculated as he hath.'"You see," said the major, in explanation, "Bigaroo having stolen me was
smart enough to see how it would be if he spoke.A guilty person in nine
cases out of ten would have kept silent and let the slave suffer.So
Bigaroo escaped; but all the others were searched and of course I was
not found.Fuzzywuz was wild with sorrow and anger, and declared that
unless I was returned within ten minutes he would wage war upon, and
utterly destroy, every king in the place.The kings all turned
pale--even Bigaroo's cheek grew white, but having me he was determined
to keep me and so the war began.""Why didn't you speak and save the innocent kings?""Did you ever see a spoon with a
tongue?"He evidently had never seen a spoon with a
tongue."The war was a terrible one," said the major, resuming his story."One
by one the kings were destroyed, and finally only Bigaroo remained, and
Fuzzywuz not having found me in the treasures of the others, finally
came to see that it was Bigaroo who had stolen me.So he turned his
forces toward the wicked monarch, defeated his army, and set fire to his
palace.In that fire I was destroyed as a souvenir spoon and became a
lump of lead once more, lying in the ruins for nearly a thousand years,
when I was sold along with a lot of iron and other things to a junk
dealer.He in turn sold me to a ship-maker, who worked me over into a
sounding lead for a steamer he had built.On my first trip out I was
sent overboard to see how deep the ocean was.I fell in between two
huge rocks down on the ocean's bed and was caught, the rope connecting
me with the ship snapped, and there I was, twenty thousand fathoms under
the sea, lost, as I supposed, forever.The effect of the salt water upon
me was very much like that of hair restorer on some people's heads.I
began to grow a head of green hair--seaweed some people call it--and to
this fact, strangely enough, I owed my escape from the water.A sea-cow
who used to graze about where I lay, thinking that I was only a tuft of
grass gathered me in one afternoon and swallowed me without blinking,
and some time after, the cow having been caught and killed by some giant
fishermen, I was found by the wife of one of the men when the great cow
was about to be cooked.These giants were very strange people who
inhabited an island out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which was
gradually sinking into the water with the weight of the people on it,
and which has now entirely disappeared.There wasn't one of the
inhabitants that was less than one hundred feet tall, and in those days
they used to act as light-houses for each other at night.They had but
one eye apiece, and when that was open it used to flash just like a
great electric light, and they'd take turns at standing up in the
middle of the island all night long and turning round and round and
round until you'd think they'd drop with dizziness.I staid with these
people, I should say, about forty years, when one morning two of the
giants got disputing as to which of them could throw a stone the
farthest.One of them said he could throw a pebble two thousand miles,
and the other said he could throw one all the way round the world.At
this the first one laughed and jeered, and to prove that he had told the
truth the second grabbed up what he thought was a pebble, but which
happened to be me and threw me from him with all his force."And sad to say I
killed the giant who threw me," returned the major."I went around the
world so swiftly that when I got back to the island the poor fellow
hadn't had time to get out of my way, and as I came whizzing along I
struck him in the back, went right through him, and leaving him dead on
the island went on again and finally fell into a great gun manufactory
in Massachusetts where I was smelted over into a bullet, and sent to the
war.I think I must have
killed off half a dozen regiments of his enemies, and between you and
me, General Washington said I was his favorite bullet, and added that as
long as he had me with him he wasn't afraid of anybody."Here the major paused a minute to smile at the sprite who was beginning
to look a little blue.It was rather plain, the sprite thought, that the
major was getting the best of the duel.How long did you stay with George
Washington?""I'd never have left him if he hadn't
ordered me to do work that I wasn't made for.When a bullet goes to war
he doesn't want to waste himself on ducks.I wanted to go after hostile
generals and majors and cornet players, and if Mr.Washington had used
me for them I'd have hit home every time, but instead of that he took me
off duck shooting one day and actually asked me to knock over a
miserable wild bird he happened to want.He
insisted, and I said,'very well, General, fire away.'He fired, the
duck laughed, and I simply flew off into the woods on the border of the
bay and rested there for nearly a hundred years.The rest of my story
is soon told.I lay where I had fallen until six years ago when I was
picked up by a small boy who used me for a sinker to go fishing with,
after which I found my way into the smelting pot once more, and on the
Fifteenth of November, 1892, I became what I am, Major Blueface, the
handsomest soldier, the bravest warrior, the most talented tin poet that
ever breathed."A long silence followed the completion of the major's story.Which of
the two he liked the better Jimmieboy could not make up his mind, and he
hoped his two companions would be considerate enough not to ask him to
decide between them."I thought they had to be true stories," said the sprite, gloomily."I
don't think it's fair to tell stories like yours--the idea of your being
thrown one and a half times around the world!""It's just as true as yours, anyhow," retorted the major, "but if you
want to begin all over again and tell another I'm ready for you.""We'll leave it to Jimmieboy as it is.""I don't know about that, major," said Jimmieboy."I think you are just
about even."asked the sprite, his face beaming with
pleasure."We'll settle it this way: we'll give five points
to the one who told the best, five points to the one who told the
longest, and five points to the one who told the shortest story.As the
stories are equally good you both get five points for that.The major's
was the longest, I think, so he gets five more, but so does the sprite
because his was the shortest.That makes you both ten, so you both win.""Yes," said the sprite, squeezing Jimmieboy's hand affectionately, "and
so do I."Which after all, I think, was the best way to decide a duel of that
sort."Well, now that that is settled," said the major with a sigh of relief,
"I suppose we had better start off and see whether Fortyforefoot will
attend to this business of getting the provisions for us.""The major is right there, Jimmieboy.You have
delayed so long on the way that it is about time you did something, and
the only way I know of for you to do it is by getting hold of
Fortyforefoot.If you wanted an apple pie and there was nothing in sight
but a cart-wheel he would change it into an apple pie for you.""That's all very well," replied Jimmieboy, "but I'm not going to call on
any giant who'd want to eat me.You might just as well understand that
right off.I'll try on your invisible coat and if that makes me
invisible I'll go.If it doesn't we'll have to try some other plan.""That is the prudent thing to do," said the major, nodding his approval
to the little general."As my poem tries to teach, it is always wise to
use your eyes--or look before you leap.The way it goes is this:

    'If you are asked to make a jump,
     Be careful lest you prove a gump--
         Awake or e'en in sleep--
     Don't hesitate the slightest bit
     To show that you've at least the wit
         To look before you leap.Why, in a dream one night, I thought
     A fellow told me that I ought
         To jump to Labrador.I did not look but blindly hopped,
     And where do you suppose I stopped?I do not say, had I been wise
     Enough that time to use my eyes--
         As I've already said--
     To Labrador I would have got:
     But this _is_ certain, I would not
         Have tumbled out of bed.'"The moral of which is, be careful how you go into things, and if you
are not certain that you are coming out all right don't go into them,"
added the major."Why, when I was a mouse----"

"Oh, come, major--you couldn't have been a mouse," interrupted the
sprite."You've just told us all about what you've been in the past, and
you couldn't have been all that and a mouse too.""So I have," said the major, with a smile."I'd forgotten that, and you
are right, too.I should have put what I
was going to say differently.If I had ever been a mouse--that's the way
it should be--if I had ever been a mouse and had been foolish enough to
stick my head into a mouse-trap after a piece of cheese without knowing
that I should get it out again, I should not have been here to-day, in
all likelihood.Try on the invisible
coat, Jimmieboy, and let's see how it works before you risk calling on
Fortyforefoot.""Here it is," said the sprite, holding out his hands with apparently
nothing in them.Jimmieboy laughed a little, it seemed so odd to have a person say "here
it is" and yet not be able to see the object referred to.He reached out
his hand, however, to take the coat, relying upon the sprite's statement
that it was there, and was very much surprised to find that his hand did
actually touch something that felt like a coat, and in fact was a coat,
though entirely invisible."Shall I help you on with it?""Perhaps you'd better," said Jimmieboy."It feels a little small for
me.""That's what I was afraid of," said the sprite."You see it covers me
all over from head to foot--that is the coat covers all but my head and
the hood covers that--but you are very much taller than I am."Here Jimmieboy, having at last got into the coat and buttoned it about
him, had the strange sensation of seeing all of himself disappear
excepting his head and legs.These remaining uncovered were of course
still in sight.laughed the major, merrily, as Jimmieboy walked around."That is the most ridiculous thing I ever saw.You're nothing but a head
and pair of legs."Jimmieboy smiled and placed the hood over his head and the major roared
louder than ever.That's funnier still--now
you're nothing but a pair of legs.Take it off quick or
I'll die with laughter.""I'm afraid it won't do, Spritey," he said."Fortyforefoot would see my
legs and if he caught them I'd be lost.""That's a fact," said the sprite, thoughtfully."The coat is almost two
feet too short for you.""It's more than two feet too short," laughed the major."It's two whole
legs too short.""This is no time for joking," said the sprite."We've too much to talk
about to use our mouths for laughing.""I won't get off any more, or if I do they
won't be the kind to make you laugh.But I say, boys," he added, "I have a scheme.It is of course the scheme
of a soldier and may be attended by danger, but if it is successful all
the more credit to the one who succeeds.We three people can attack
Fortyforefoot openly, capture him, and not let him go until he provides
us with the provisions.""That sounds lovely," sneered the sprite."But I'd like to know some of
the details of this scheme.It is easy enough to say attack him, capture
him and not let him go, but the question is, how shall we do all this?""It ought to be easy," returned the major."There are only three things
to be done.A kitten can attack an elephant if it wants to.The second is to capture
him, which, while it seems hard, is not really so if the attack is
properly made."Clear as a fog," put in the sprite."Now there are three of us--Jimmieboy, Spriteyboy and Yourstrulyboy,"
continued the major, "so what could be more natural than that we should
divide up these three operations among us?Therefore I propose
that Jimmieboy here shall attack Fortyforefoot; the sprite shall capture
him and throw him into a dungeon cell and I will crown the work by not
letting him go.""Jimmieboy and I take all the danger I
notice.""I am utterly unselfish about
it.I am willing to put myself in the background and let you have all
the danger and most of the glory.I only come in at the very end--but I
don't mind that.I have had glory enough for ten life-times, so why
should I grudge you this one little bit of it?My feelings in regard to
glory will be found on the fortieth page of Leaden Lyrics or the Ballads
of Ben Bullet--otherwise myself.The verses read as follows:

    'Though glory, it must be confessed,
       Is satisfying stuff,
     Upon my laurels let me rest
       For I have had enough.Ne'er was a glorier man than I,
       Ne'er shall a glorier be,
     Than, trembling reader, you'll espy--
       When haply you spy me.So bring no more--for while 'tis good
       To have, 'tis also plain
     A bit of added glory would
       Be apt to make me vain.'And I don't want to be vain," concluded the major."Well, I don't want any of your glory," said the sprite, "and if I know
Jimmieboy I don't think he does either.If you want to reverse your
order of things and do the dangerous part of the work yourself, we will
do all in our power to make your last hours comfortable, and I will see
to it that the newspapers tell how bravely you died, but we can't go
into the scheme any other way.""You talk as if you were the general's prime minister, or his nurse,"
retorted the major, "whereas in reality I, being his chief of staff, am
they if anybody are."Here the major blushed a little because he was not quite sure of his
grammar.Neither of his companions seemed to notice the mixture,
however, and so he continued:

"General, it is for you to say.Shall my plan go or shall she stay?""Well, I think myself, major, that it is a little too dangerous for me,
and if any other plan could be made I'd like it better," answered
Jimmieboy, anxious to soothe the major's feelings which were evidently
getting hurt again."Suppose I go back and order the soldiers to attack
Fortyforefoot and bring him in chains to me?""Couldn't be done," said the sprite."The minute the chains were clapped
on him he would change them into doughnuts and eat them all up.""Yes," put in the major, "and the chances are he would turn the soldiers
into a lot of toy balloons on a string and then cut the string.""He couldn't do that," said the sprite, "because he can't turn people or
animals into anything."Well, I think the best thing to do would be for me to change myself
into a giant bigger than he is," said the sprite."Then I could put you
and the major in my pockets and call upon Fortyforefoot and ask him, in
a polite way, to turn some pebbles and sticks and other articles into
the things we want, and, if he won't do it except he is paid, we'll pay
him if we can.""What do you propose to pay him with?""I suppose
you'll hand him half a dozen checkerberries and tell him if he'll turn
them into ten one dollar bills he'll have ten dollars."You can't tempt Fortyforefoot with
money.It is only by offering him something to eat that we can hope to
get his assistance."And you'll request him to turn a handful of pine cones into a dozen
turkeys on toast, I presume?"I shall simply offer to let him have
you for dinner--you will serve up well in croquettes--Blueface
croquettes--eh, Jimmieboy?"The poor major turned white with fear and rage.At first he felt
inclined to slay the sprite on the spot, and then it suddenly flashed
across his mind that before he could do it the sprite might really turn
himself into a giant and do with him as he had said.So he contented
himself with turning pale and giving a sickly smile."That would be a good joke on me," he said.Sprite, I don't think I would enjoy it, and after all I have a sort of
notion that I would disagree with Fortyforefoot--which would be
extremely unfortunate.I know I should rest like lead on his
digestion--and that would make him angry with you and I should be
sacrificed for nothing.""Well, I wouldn't consent to that anyhow," said Jimmieboy."I love the
major too much to----"

"So do we all," interrupted the sprite."Why even I love the major and I
wouldn't let anybody eat him for anything--no, sir!--not if I were
offered a whole vanilla eclaire would I permit the major to be eaten.I will turn myself into a giant
twice as big as Fortyforefoot; I will place you and the major in my
pockets and then I will call upon him.He will be so afraid of me that
he will do almost anything I ask him to, but to make him give us the
very best things he can make I would rather deal gently with him, and
instead of forcing him to make the peaches and cherries I'll offer to
trade you two fellows off for the things we need.He will be pleased
enough at the chance to get anything so good to eat as you look, and
he'll prepare everything for us, and he will put you down stairs in the
pantry.Then I will tell him stories, and some of the major's jokes, to
make him sleepy, and when finally he dozes off I will steal the pantry
key and set you free."It's a very good plan unless Fortyforefoot should find us so toothsome
looking that he would want to eat us raw.We may be nothing more than
fruit for him, you know, and truly I don't want to be anybody's apple,"
said Jimmieboy."You are quite correct there, general," said the major, with a chuckle."In fact, I'm quite sure he'd think you and I were fruit because being
two we are necessarily a pear.""It won't happen," said the sprite."He isn't likely to think you are
fruit and even if he does I won't let him eat you.I'll keep him from
doing it if I have to eat you myself.""Oh, of course, then, with a kind promise like that there is nothing
left for us to do but accept your proposition," said the
major."As Ben Bullet says:

    'When only one thing can be done--
       If people only knew it--
     The wisest course beneath the sun
       Is just to go and do it.'""I'm willing to take my chances," said Jimmieboy, "if after I see what
kind of a giant you can turn yourself into I think you are terrible
enough to frighten another giant.""Well, just watch me," said the sprite, taking off his coat."And mind,
however terrifying I may become, don't you get frightened, because I
won't hurt you.""Go ahead," said the major, valiantly."Wait until we get scared before
talking like that to us."'Bazam, bazam,
     A sprite I am,
     Bazoo, bazee,
     A giant I'd be.'"Then there came a terrific noise; the trees about the little group shook
to the very last end of their roots, all grew dark as night, and as
quickly grew light again.In the returning light Jimmieboy saw looming
up before him a fearful creature, eighty feet high, clad in a
magnificent suit embroidered with gold and silver, a fierce mustache
upon his lip, and dangling at his side was a heavy sword.It was the sprite now transformed into a giant--a terrible-looking
fellow, though to Jimmieboy he was not terrible because the boy knew
that the dreadful creature was only his little friend in disguise.came a bellowing voice from above the trees.I'm sure you'll do, and I am ready,"
said Jimmieboy, with a laugh.But there came no answer, and Jimmieboy, looking about him to see why
the major made no reply, was just in time to see that worthy soldier's
coat-tails disappearing down the road.The major was running away as fast as he could go."You've frightened him pretty well, Spritey," said Jimmieboy, with a
laugh, as the major passed out of sight."But you don't seem a bit afraid.""I'm not--though I think I should be if I didn't know who you are,"
returned Jimmieboy."Well, I need to be if I am to get the best of Fortyforefoot, but, I
say, you mustn't call me Spritey now that I am a giant.It won't do to
call me by any name that would show Fortyforefoot who I really am," said
the sprite, with a warning shake of his head."Bludgeonhead is my name now," replied the sprite."Benjamin B.
Bludgeonhead is my full name, but you know me well enough to call me
plain Bludgeonhead.""All right, plain Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, "I'll do as you
say--and now don't you think we'd better be starting along?""Yes," said Bludgeonhead, reaching down and grabbing hold of Jimmieboy
with his huge hand."We'll start right away, and until we come in sight
of Fortyforefoot's house I think perhaps you'll be more comfortable if
you ride on my shoulder instead of in my coat-pocket.""Thank you very much," said Jimmieboy, as Bludgeonhead lifted him up
from the ground and set him lightly as a feather on his shoulder."I think I'd like to be
as tall as this all the time, Bludgeonhead.What a great thing it would
be on parade days to be as tall as this.Why I can see miles and miles
of country from here.""Yes, it's pretty fine--but I don't think I'd care to be so tall
always," returned Bludgeonhead, as he stepped over a great broad river
that lay in his path."It makes one very uppish to be as high in the air
as this; and you'd be all the time looking down on your friends, too,
which would be so unpleasant for your friends that they wouldn't have
anything to do with you after a while.I'm going to
jump over this mountain in front of us."Here Bludgeonhead drew back a little and then took a short run, after
which he leaped high in the air, and he and Jimmieboy sailed easily over
the great hills before them, and then alighted safe and sound on the
other side.cried Jimmieboy, clapping his hands with glee."I hope there are lots more hills like that to be jumped over.""No, there aren't," said Bludgeonhead, "but if you like it so much I'll
go back and do it again."Bludgeonhead turned back and jumped over the mountain half a dozen times
until Jimmieboy was satisfied and then he resumed his journey."This," he said, after trudging along in silence for some time, "this is
Fortyforefoot Valley, and in a short time we shall come to the giant's
castle; but meanwhile I want you to see what a wonderful place this is.The valley itself will give you a better idea of Fortyforefoot's great
power as a magician than anything else that I know of.Do you know what
this place was before he came here?""It was a great big hole in the ground," returned Bludgeonhead.Daniel went to the office.Fortyforefoot liked the situation because it was
surrounded by mountains and nobody ever wanted to come here because sand
pits aren't worth visiting.There wasn't a tree or a speck of a green
thing anywhere in sight--nothing but yellow sand glaring in the sun all
day and sulking in the moon all night."It's all covered with beautiful trees and
gardens and brooks now," said Jimmieboy, which was quite true, for the
Fortyforefoot Valley was a perfect paradise to look at, filled with
everything that was beautiful in the way of birds and trees and flowers
and water courses."How could he make the trees and flowers grow in dry
hot sand like that?""By his magic power, of course," answered Bludgeonhead."He filled up a
good part of the sand pit with stones that he found about here, and then
he changed one part of the desert into a pond so that he could get all
the water he wanted.Then he took a square mile of sand and changed
every grain of it into blades of grass.Other portions he transformed
into forests until finally simply by the wonderful power he has to
change one thing into another he got the place into its present shape.""But the birds, how did he make them?""He didn't," said Bludgeonhead.They saw
what a beautiful place this was and they simply moved in."Bludgeonhead paused a moment in his walk and set Jimmieboy down on the
ground again."I think I'll take a rest here before going on.We are very near to
Fortyforefoot's castle now," he said."I'll sit down here for a few
moments and sharpen my sword and get in good shape for a fight if one
becomes necessary.This place is full of
traps for just such fellows as you who come in here.That's the way
Fortyforefoot catches them for dinner."So Jimmieboy staid close by Bludgeonhead's side and was very much
entertained by all that went on around him.He saw the most wonderful
birds imaginable, and great bumble-bees buzzed about in the flowers
gathering honey by the quart.Once a great jack-rabbit, three times as
large as he was, came rushing out of the woods toward him, and Jimmieboy
on stooping to pick up a stone to throw at Mr.Bunny to frighten him
away, found that all the stones in that enchanted valley were precious.He couldn't help laughing outright when he discovered that the stone he
had thrown at the rabbit was a huge diamond as big as his fist, and that
even had he stopped to choose a less expensive missile he would have had
to confine his choice to pearls, rubies, emeralds, and other gems of the
rarest sort.And then he noticed that what he thought was a rock upon
which he and Bludgeonhead were sitting was a massive nugget of pure
yellow gold.This lead him on to inspect the trees about him and then he
discovered a most absurd thing.Fortyforefoot's extravagance had
prompted him to make all his pine trees of the most beautifully polished
and richly inlaid mahogany; every one of the weeping willows was made of
solid oak, ornamented and carved until the eye wearied of its beauty,
and as for the birds in the trees, their nests were made not of stray
wisps of straw and hay stolen from the barns and fields, but of the
softest silk, rich in color and lined throughout with eiderdown, the
mere sight of which could hardly help being restful to a tired bird--or
boy either, for that matter, Jimmieboy thought."Did he make all this out of sand?All these jewels and magnificent
carvings?""Simply took up a handful of sand and tossed
it up in the air and whatever he commanded it to be it became.But the
most wonderful thing in this place is his spring.He made what you might
call a 'Wish Dipper' out of an old tin cup.Then he dug a hole and
filled it with sand which he commanded to become liquid, and, when the
sand heard him say that, it turned to liquid, but the singular thing
about it is that as Fortyforefoot didn't say what kind of liquid it
should be, it became any kind.So now if any one is thirsty and wants a
glass of cider all he has to do is to dip the wish dipper into the
spring and up comes cider.If he wants lemonade up comes lemonade.If he
wants milk up comes milk.As Bludgeonhead spoke these words Jimmieboy was startled to hear
something very much like an approaching footstep far down the road.he asked, seizing Bludgeonhead by the hand."Yes, I did," replied Bludgeonhead, in a whisper."It sounded to me like
Fortyforefoot's step, too.""I'd better hide, hadn't I?"Climb inside
my coat and snuggle down out of sight in my pocket.We musn't let him
see you yet awhile."Jimmieboy did as he was commanded, and found the pocket a very
comfortable place, only it was a little stuffy."It's pretty hot in here," he whispered."Well, look up on the left hand corner of the outer side of the pocket
and you'll find two flaps that are buttoned up," replied Bludgeonhead,
softly.One will let in all the air you want, and the
other will enable you to peep out and see Fortyforefoot without his
seeing you."In a minute the buttons were found and the flaps opened.Everything
happened as Bludgeonhead said it would, and in a minute Jimmieboy,
peering out through the hole in the cloak, saw Fortyforefoot
approaching.The owner of the beautiful valley seemed very angry when he caught sight
of Bludgeonhead sitting on his property, and hastening up to him, he
cried:

"What business have you here in the Valley of Fortyforefoot?"Jimmieboy shrank back into one corner of the pocket, a little overcome
with fear.Fortyforefoot was larger and more terrible than he thought."I am not good at riddles," said Bludgeonhead, calmly."That is at
riddles of that sort.If you had asked me the difference between a duck
and a garden rake I should have told you that a duck has no teeth and
can eat, while a rake has plenty of teeth and can't eat.But when you
ask me what business I have here I am forced to say that I can't say.""You are a very bright sort of a giant," sneered Fortyforefoot."The fact is I can't help being bright.My
mother polishes me every morning with a damp chamois.""Do you know to whom you are speaking?"asked Fortyforefoot,
threateningly."No; not having been introduced to you, I can't say I know you,"
returned Bludgeonhead.You are Anklehigh, the
Dwarf."At this Fortyforefoot turned purple with rage."I'll right quickly teach thee a
lesson thou rash fellow."Fortyforefoot strode up close to Bludgeonhead, whose size he could not
have guessed because Bludgeonhead had been sitting down all this time
and was pretty well covered over by his cloak.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD SHOWS JIMMIEBOY TO FORTYFOREFOOT.[Blank Page]

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?""That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

The use of capitalisation for major and general has been retained as
appears in the original publication.Changes have been made as follows:

    ejaculated the Paralleopipedon _changed to_
    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?She'll be able to
go out soon.Don't you think something ought to be done to keep her
from--going back?"She was so young to face all this;
and yet, since face it she must, how much better to have her do it
squarely."Does she want to change her mode of life?"She
cares a great deal for some man.The other day I propped her up in bed
and gave her a newspaper, and after a while I found the paper on the
floor, and she was crying.The other patients avoid her, and it was
some time before I noticed it.The next day she told me that the man
was going to marry some one else.'He wouldn't marry me, of course,' she
said; 'but he might have told me.'"Le Moyne did his best, that afternoon in the little parlor, to provide
Sidney with a philosophy to carry her through her training.He told her
that certain responsibilities were hers, but that she could not reform
the world.Broad charity, tenderness, and healing were her province."Help them all you can," he finished, feeling inadequate and hopelessly
didactic."Cure them; send them out with a smile; and--leave the rest to
the Almighty."Sidney was resigned, but not content.Newly facing the evil of the
world, she was a rampant reformer at once.Only the arrival of Christine
and her fiance saved his philosophy from complete rout.He had time for
a question between the ring of the bell and Katie's deliberate progress
from the kitchen to the front door.He stops at the door of the ward and speaks to me.It
makes me quite distinguished, for a probationer.Usually, you know, the
staff never even see the probationers.""I think he is very wonderful," said Sidney valiantly.Christine Lorenz, while not large, seemed to fill the little room.Her
voice, which was frequent and penetrating, her smile, which was wide
and showed very white teeth that were a trifle large for beauty, her
all-embracing good nature, dominated the entire lower floor.K., who had
met her before, retired into silence and a corner.Young Howe smoked a
cigarette in the hall.said Christine, and put her cheek against Sidney's.Palmer gives you a month to tire of it
all; but I said--"

"I take that back," Palmer spoke indolently from the corridor."There
is the look of willing martyrdom in her face.I've
brought some nuts for him.""Reginald is back in the woods again.""Now, look here," he said solemnly."When we arranged about these rooms,
there were certain properties that went with them--the lady next door
who plays Paderewski's 'Minuet' six hours a day, and K. here, and
Reginald.If you must take something to the woods, why not the minuet
person?"Howe was a good-looking man, thin, smooth-shaven, aggressively well
dressed.This Sunday afternoon, in a cutaway coat and high hat, with
an English malacca stick, he was just a little out of the picture.The
Street said that he was "wild," and that to get into the Country Club
set Christine was losing more than she was gaining.Christine had stepped out on the balcony, and was speaking to K. just
inside."It's rather a queer way to live, of course," she said."But Palmer is a
pauper, practically.We are going to take our meals at home for a while.You see, certain things that we want we can't have if we take a house--a
car, for instance.We'll need one for running out to the Country Club to
dinner.Of course, unless father gives me one for a wedding present, it
will be a cheap one.And we're getting the Rosenfeld boy to drive it.He's crazy about machinery, and he'll come for practically nothing."K. had never known a married couple to take two rooms and go to the
bride's mother's for meals in order to keep a car.Also, certain sophistries of his former world about a cheap
chauffeur being costly in the end rose in his mind and were carefully
suppressed."You'll find a car a great comfort, I'm sure," he said politely.She liked his graying hair
and steady eyes, and insisted on considering his shabbiness a pose.She
was conscious that she made a pretty picture in the French window, and
preened herself like a bright bird."You'll come out with us now and then, I hope.""Isn't it odd to think that we are going to be practically one family!"He caught the flash of Christine's smile, and smiled back.Christine was
glad she had decided to take the rooms, glad that K. lived there.This
thing of marriage being the end of all things was absurd.A married
woman should have men friends; they kept her up.She would take him to
the Country Club.Across the Street, the Rosenfeld boy had stopped by Dr.Wilson's car,
and was eyeing it with the cool, appraising glance of the street
boy whose sole knowledge of machinery has been acquired from the
clothes-washer at home.Joe Drummond, eyes carefully ahead, went up the
Street.McKee's, stood in the doorway and fanned herself
with her apron.Max Wilson came out of the house and got into his car.For a minute, perhaps, all the actors, save Carlotta and Dr.It was that bete noir of the playwright, an ensemble; K. Le
Moyne and Sidney, Palmer Howe, Christine, Tillie, the younger Wilson,
Joe, even young Rosenfeld, all within speaking distance, almost touching
distance, gathered within and about the little house on a side street
which K. at first grimly and now tenderly called "home."CHAPTER X


On Monday morning, shortly after the McKee prolonged breakfast was over,
a small man of perhaps fifty, with iron-gray hair and a sparse goatee,
made his way along the Street.He moved with the air of one having a
definite destination but a by no means definite reception.As he walked along he eyed with a professional glance the ailanthus and
maple trees which, with an occasional poplar, lined the Street.McKee's boarding-house he stopped.Owing to a slight change
in the grade of the street, the McKee house had no stoop, but one flat
doorstep.Thus it was possible to ring the doorbell from the pavement,
and this the stranger did.It gave him a curious appearance of being
ready to cut and run if things were unfavorable.She recognized him at once, but no smile met the nervous one
that formed itself on the stranger's face."Oh, it's you, is it?""I was thinking, as I came along," he said, "that you and the neighbors
had better get after these here caterpillars."If you want to see Tillie, she's busy.""I only want to say how-d 'ye-do.A certain doggedness took the place of his tentative smile."I'll say it to myself, I guess.I don't want any unpleasantness, but
I've come a good ways to see her and I'll hang around until I do."McKee knew herself routed, and retreated to the kitchen."You're wanted out front," she said.Only, my advice to you is, don't be a fool."The hands with which she tied a white apron
over her gingham one were shaking.Her visitor had accepted the open door as permission to enter and was
standing in the hall.He went rather white himself when he saw Tillie coming toward him down
the hall.He knew that for Tillie this visit would mean that he was
free--and he was not free.Sheer terror of his errand filled him."Well, here I am, Tillie."said poor Tillie, with the
question in her eyes."I was passing through, and I just thought I'd call around and tell
you--My God, Tillie, I'm glad to see you!"She made no reply, but opened the door into the cool and, shaded little
parlor.He followed her in and closed the door behind him.Playing with paper dolls--that's the latest."Tillie sat down suddenly on one of the stiff chairs.Her lips were as
white as her face."I thought, when I saw you--"

"I was afraid you'd think that."Tillie's hands twisted nervously in her lap.Schwitter's eyes were fixed on the window, which looked back on the
McKee yard."That spiraea back there's not looking very good.If you'll save the
cigar butts around here and put them in water, and spray it, you'll kill
the lice.""I don't know why you come around bothering me," she said dully."I've
been getting along all right; now you come and upset everything."Schwitter rose and took a step toward her."Well, I'll tell you why I came.I ain't getting any
younger, am I?Time's going on, and I'm wanting you all the time.What've I got out of life, anyhow?"What's that got to do with me?""You're lonely, too, ain't you?"And, anyhow, there's always a crowd
here.""You can be lonely in a crowd, and I guess--is there any one around here
you like better than me?""We can talk our heads off and
not get anywhere.You've got a wife living, and, unless you intend to do
away with her, I guess that's all there is to it."Haven't you got a right to be happy?"She was quick of wit, and she read his tone as well as his words."You get out of here--and get out quick!"She had jumped to her feet; but he only looked at her with understanding
eyes."That's the way I thought of it at first.Maybe I've
just got used to the idea, but it doesn't seem so bad to me now.Here
are you, drudging for other people when you ought to have a place all
your own--and not gettin' younger any more than I am.Here's both of us
lonely.I'd be a good husband to you, Till--because, whatever it'd be in
law, I'd be your husband before God."Tillie cowered against the door, her eyes on his.Here before her,
embodied in this man, stood all that she had wanted and never had.He
meant a home, tenderness, children, perhaps.He turned away from the
look in her eyes and stared out of the front window."Them poplars out there ought to be taken away," he said heavily.Tillie found her voice at last:--

"I couldn't do it, Mr."Perhaps, if you got used to the idea--"

"What's that to do with the right and wrong of it?"It seems to
me that the Lord would make an exception of us if He knew the
circumstances.Perhaps, after you get used to the idea--What I thought
was like this.I've got a little farm about seven miles from the city
limits, and the tenant on it says that nearly every Sunday somebody
motors out from town and wants a chicken-and-waffle supper.There ain't
much in the nursery business anymore.These landscape fellows buy their
stuff direct, and the middleman's out.I've got a good orchard, and
there's a spring, so I could put running water in the house.I'd be good
to you, Tillie,--I swear it."Don't a man respect a woman that's got courage enough to give up
everything for him?"Tillie was crying softly into her apron.He put a work-hardened hand on
her head."It isn't as if I'd run around after women," he said."You're the only
one, since Maggie--" He drew a long breath."I'll give you time to think
it over.Suppose I stop in to-morrow morning.It doesn't commit you to
anything to talk it over."There had been no passion in the interview, and there was none in
the touch of his hand.He was not young, and the tragic loneliness of
approaching old age confronted him.He was trying to solve his problem
and Tillie's, and what he had found was no solution, but a compromise."To-morrow morning, then," he said quietly, and went out the door.All that hot August morning Tillie worked in a daze.McKee watched
her and said nothing.She interpreted the girl's white face and set lips
as the result of having had to dismiss Schwitter again, and looked for
time to bring peace, as it had done before.Le Moyne came late to his midday meal.For once, the mental anaesthesia
of endless figures had failed him.On his way home he had drawn his
small savings from the bank, and mailed them, in cash and registered, to
a back street in the slums of a distant city.He had done this before,
and always with a feeling of exaltation, as if, for a time at least,
the burden he carried was lightened.But to-day he experienced no
compensatory relief.Life was dull and stale to him, effort ineffectual.At thirty a man should look back with tenderness, forward with hope.K.
Le Moyne dared not look back, and had no desire to look ahead into empty
years.Although he ate little, the dining-room was empty when he finished.Usually he had some cheerful banter for Tillie, to which she responded
in kind.But, what with the heat and with heaviness of spirit, he did
not notice her depression until he rose."Why, you're not sick, are you, Tillie?"If I send you two tickets to a
roof garden where there's a variety show, can't you take a friend and go
to-night?""Thanks; I guess I'll not go out."Then, unexpectedly, she bent her head against a chair-back and fell to
silent crying.Then:--

"Now--tell me about it.""I'm just worried; that's all.""Let's see if we can't fix up the worries."Then I'm the person to tell it to.I--I'm pretty much a lost soul
myself."He put an arm over her shoulders and drew her up, facing him."Suppose we go into the parlor and talk it out.I'll bet things are not
as bad as you imagine."But when, in the parlor that had seen Mr.Schwitter's strange proposal
of the morning, Tillie poured out her story, K."The wicked part is that I want to go with him," she finished."I keep
thinking about being out in the country, and him coming into supper, and
everything nice for him and me cleaned up and waiting--O my God!I've
always been a good woman until now.""I--I understand a great deal better than you think I do.The only thing is--"

"Go on."You might go on and be very happy.And as for the--for his wife, it
won't do her any harm.But when they come, and you cannot give
them a name--don't you see?God forbid that
I--But no happiness is built on a foundation of wrong.It's been tried
before, Tillie, and it doesn't pan out."He was conscious of a feeling of failure when he left her at last.She
had acquiesced in what he said, knew he was right, and even promised
to talk to him again before making a decision one way or the other.But
against his abstractions of conduct and morality there was pleading in
Tillie the hungry mother-heart; law and creed and early training were
fighting against the strongest instinct of the race.CHAPTER XI


The hot August days dragged on.Merciless sunlight beat in through the
slatted shutters of ward windows.At night, from the roof to which the
nurses retired after prayers for a breath of air, lower surrounding
roofs were seen to be covered with sleepers.Children dozed precariously
on the edge of eternity; men and women sprawled in the grotesque
postures of sleep.There was a sort of feverish irritability in the air.Even the nurses,
stoically unmindful of bodily discomfort, spoke curtly or not at all.Miss Dana, in Sidney's ward, went down with a low fever, and for a day
or so Sidney and Miss Grange got along as best they could.Sidney worked
like two or more, performed marvels of bed-making, learned to give
alcohol baths for fever with the maximum of result and the minimum
of time, even made rounds with a member of the staff and came through
creditably.Ed Wilson had sent a woman patient into the ward, and his visits
were the breath of life to the girl.Some of them will
try to take it out of you.It's been hot, and of course it's troublesome to tell
me everything.I--I think they're all very kind."He reached out a square, competent hand, and put it over hers."We miss you in the Street," he said."It's all sort of dead there since
you left.Joe Drummond doesn't moon up and down any more, for one thing.What was wrong between you and Joe, Sidney?""I didn't want to marry him; that's all."Then, seeing her face:--

"But you're right, of course.Don't marry anyone unless you can't live
without him.That's been my motto, and here I am, still single."During the lonely times when Max was at college and in Europe, he had
watched her grow from a child to a young girl.He did not suspect for
a moment that in that secret heart of hers he sat newly enthroned, in
a glow of white light, as Max's brother; that the mere thought that
he lived in Max's house (it was, of course Max's house to her), sat at
Max's breakfast table, could see him whenever he wished, made the touch
of his hand on hers a benediction and a caress.Sidney finished folding linen and went back to the ward.Almost every bed had its visitor beside it; but
Sidney, running an eye over the ward, found the girl of whom she had
spoken to Le Moyne quite alone.She was propped up in bed, reading; but
at each new step in the corridor hope would spring into her eyes and die
again.If these people would only get out and let me read
in peace--Say, sit down and talk to me, won't you?It beats the mischief
the way your friends forget you when you're laid up in a place like
this.""People can't always come at visiting hours."A girl I knew was sick here last year, and it wasn't too hot for me to
trot in twice a week with a bunch of flowers for her.Do you think she's
been here once?Then, suddenly:--

"You know that man I told you about the other day?""It was a shock to me, that's all.I didn't want you to think I'd break
my heart over any fellow.All I meant was, I wished he'd let me know."They looked unnaturally large and somber in
her face.Her hair had been cut short, and her nightgown, open at the
neck, showed her thin throat and prominent clavicles."You're from the city, aren't you, Miss Page?""You told me the street, but I've forgotten it."Sidney repeated the name of the Street, and slipped a fresh pillow under
the girl's head."The evening paper says there's a girl going to be married on your
street."A friend of mine is going to be married.I--I don't remember the man's name."I suppose you'll be going to that wedding?""If I ever get time to have a dress made, I'll surely go."Toward six o'clock the next morning, the night nurse was making out her
reports.On one record, which said at the top, "Grace Irving, age 19,"
and an address which, to the initiated, told all her story, the night
nurse wrote:--

"Did not sleep at all during night.Face set and eyes staring, but
complains of no pain.Carlotta Harrison, back from her vacation, reported for duty the next
morning, and was assigned to E ward, which was Sidney's.She gave Sidney
a curt little nod, and proceeded to change the entire routine with the
thoroughness of a Central American revolutionary president.Sidney, who
had yet to learn that with some people authority can only assert itself
by change, found herself confused, at sea, half resentful.Once she ventured a protest:--

"I've been taught to do it that way, Miss Harrison.If my method is
wrong, show me what you want, and I'll do my best.""I am not responsible for what you have been taught.And you will not
speak back when you are spoken to."Small as the incident was, it marked a change in Sidney's position
in the ward.She got the worst off-duty of the day, or none.Small
humiliations were hers: late meals, disagreeable duties, endless and
often unnecessary tasks.Even Miss Grange, now reduced to second place,
remonstrated with her senior."I think a certain amount of severity is good for a probationer," she
said, "but you are brutal, Miss Harrison."She's going to be one of the best nurses in
the house."Wilson's pet
probationer, that I don't always say 'please' when I ask her to change a
bed or take a temperature."Miss Grange was not lacking in keenness.She died not go to the Head,
which is unethical under any circumstances; but gradually there spread
through the training-school a story that Carlotta Harrison was jealous
of the new Page girl, Dr.Things were still highly
unpleasant in the ward, but they grew much better when Sidney was off
duty.She was asked to join a small class that was studying French at
night.As ignorant of the cause of her popularity as of the reason of
her persecution, she went steadily on her way.For the first time, she was facing problems and
demanding an answer.Why must there be Grace Irvings in the world?Why
must the healthy babies of the obstetric ward go out to the slums and
come back, in months or years, crippled for the great fight by the
handicap of their environment, rickety, tuberculous, twisted?Why need
the huge mills feed the hospitals daily with injured men?And there were other things that she thought of.Every night, on her
knees in the nurses' parlor at prayers, she promised, if she were
accepted as a nurse, to try never to become calloused, never to regard
her patients as "cases," never to allow the cleanliness and routine of
her ward to delay a cup of water to the thirsty, or her arms to a sick
child.On the whole, the world was good, she found.And, of all the good things
in it, the best was service.True, there were hot days and restless
nights, weary feet, and now and then a heartache.But to offset these there was the sound of Dr.Max's step
in the corridor, and his smiling nod from the door; there was a "God
bless you" now and then for the comfort she gave; there were wonderful
nights on the roof under the stars, until K.While Sidney watched the stars from her hospital roof, while all around
her the slum children, on other roofs, fought for the very breath of
life, others who knew and loved her watched the stars, too.K. was
having his own troubles in those days.Late at night, when Anna and
Harriet had retired, he sat on the balcony and thought of many things.He had noticed that her lips were rather blue,
and had called in Dr.Anna was not to
be told, or Sidney."Sidney can't help any," said Harriet, "and for Heaven's sake let her
have her chance.If you tell her anything at all, she'll have Sidney here, waiting on her
hand and foot."And Le Moyne, fearful of urging too much because his own heart was
crying out to have the girl back, assented.The boy did not seem to get over the
thing the way he should.Now and then Le Moyne, resuming his old habit
of wearying himself into sleep, would walk out into the country.On one
such night he had overtaken Joe, tramping along with his head down.Joe had not wanted his company, had plainly sulked."I'll not talk," he said; "but, since we're going the same way, we might
as well walk together."But after a time Joe had talked, after all.It was not much at first--a
feverish complaint about the heat, and that if there was trouble in
Mexico he thought he'd go."Wait until fall, if you're thinking of it," K. advised."This is tepid
compared with what you'll get down there.""I've got to get away from here."Since the scene at the White Springs Hotel,
both knew that no explanation was necessary."It isn't so much that I mind her turning me down," Joe said, after a
silence."A girl can't marry all the men who want her.But I don't
like this hospital idea.Sometimes"--he turned bloodshot eyes on Le Moyne--"I think she went
because she was crazy about somebody there.""She went because she wanted to be useful."For almost twenty minutes they tramped on without speech.They had made
a circle, and the lights of the city were close again.K. stopped and
put a kindly hand on Joe's shoulder."A man's got to stand up under a thing like this, you know.I mean, it
mustn't be a knockout."I'll tell you what's
eating me up," he exploded.Don't talk to me about her
going to the hospital to be useful.She's crazy about him, and he's as
crooked as a dog's hind leg."He felt immeasurably old beside Joe's boyish blustering--old and rather
helpless.Some of these days I'll get something on him.Then
she'll know what to think of her hero!""That's not quite square, is it?"Joe had left him then, wheeling abruptly off into the shadows.K. had
gone home alone, rather uneasy.There seemed to be mischief in the very
air.CHAPTER XII


Tillie was gone.Oddly enough, the last person to see her before she left was Harriet
Kennedy.Schwitter's visit, Harriet's 
maid had announced a visitor.She had taken expensive rooms
in a good location, and furnished them with the assistance of a decor
store.Then she arranged with a New York house to sell her models on
commission.Her short excursion to New York had marked for Harriet the beginning of
a new heaven and a new earth.Here, at last, she found people speaking
her own language.She ventured a suggestion to a manufacturer, and found
it greeted, not, after the manner of the Street, with scorn, but with
approval and some surprise."About once in ten years," said Mr.Arthurs, "we have a woman from out
of town bring us a suggestion that is both novel and practical.When we
find people like that, we watch them.They climb, madame,--climb."Harriet's climbing was not so rapid as to make her dizzy; but business
was coming.The first time she made a price of seventy-five dollars
for an evening gown, she went out immediately after and took a drink of
water.She began to learn little quips of the feminine mind: that a woman who
can pay seventy-five will pay double that sum; that it is not considered
good form to show surprise at a dressmaker's prices, no matter how high
they may be; that long mirrors and artificial light help sales--no woman
over thirty but was grateful for her pink-and-gray room with its soft
lights.She took a lesson
from the New York modistes, and wore trailing black gowns.She strapped
her thin figure into the best corset she could get, and had her black
hair marcelled and dressed high.And, because she was a lady by birth
and instinct, the result was not incongruous, but refined and rather
impressive.She took her business home with her at night, lay awake scheming, and
wakened at dawn to find fresh color combinations in the early sky.She
wakened early because she kept her head tied up in a towel, so that her
hair need be done only three times a week.That and the corset were the
penalties she paid.Her high-heeled shoes were a torment, too; but in
the work-room she kicked them off.To this new Harriet, then, came Tillie in her distress.Tillie was
rather overwhelmed at first.The Street had always considered Harriet
"proud."But Tillie's urgency was great, her methods direct.While she worked at the fingers of
her silk gloves, what Harriet took for nervousness was pure abstraction."It's very nice of you to come to see me.Tillie surveyed the rooms, and Harriet caught her first full view of her
face.If you have had any words--"

"It's not that.I'd like to talk to you, if you don't
mind.""I'm up against something, and I can't seem to make up my mind.Last
night I said to myself, 'I've got to talk to some woman who's not
married, like me, and not as young as she used to be.McKee: she's a widow, and wouldn't understand.'"Harriet's voice was a trifle sharp as she replied.She never lied about
her age, but she preferred to forget it."I wish you'd tell me what you're getting at.""It ain't the sort of thing to come to too sudden.You and I can pretend all we like, Miss Harriet; but we're not getting
all out of life that the Lord meant us to have.You've got them wax
figures instead of children, and I have mealers."A little spot of color came into Harriet's cheek.Regardless of the corset, she bent forward.Ten years more at the most, and I'm through.Can't get around the tables as I used to.Why, yesterday I
put sugar into Mr.Le Moyne's coffee--well, never mind about that.Now
I've got a chance to get a home, with a good man to look after me--I
like him pretty well, and he thinks a lot of me.""No'm," said Tillie; "that's it."The gray curtains with their pink cording swung gently in the open
windows.From the work-room came the distant hum of a sewing-machine and
the sound of voices.Harriet sat with her hands in her lap and listened
while Tillie poured out her story.She told it
all, consistently and with unconscious pathos: her little room under the
roof at Mrs.McKee's, and the house in the country; her loneliness,
and the loneliness of the man; even the faint stirrings of potential
motherhood, her empty arms, her advancing age--all this she knit into
the fabric of her story and laid at Harriet's feet, as the ancients put
their questions to their gods.Too much that Tillie poured out to her found
an echo in her own breast.What was this thing she was striving for but
a substitute for the real things of life--love and tenderness, children,
a home of her own?Quite suddenly she loathed the gray carpet on the
floor, the pink chairs, the shaded lamps.Tillie was no longer the
waitress at a cheap boarding-house.She loomed large, potential,
courageous, a woman who held life in her hands."She thinks any woman's a fool to take up with a man.""You're giving me a terrible responsibility, Tillie, if you're asking my
advice."I'm asking what you'd do if it happened to you.Suppose you had
no people that cared anything about you, nobody to disgrace, and all
your life nobody had really cared anything about you.And then a chance
like this came along."I don't know," said poor Harriet."It seems to me--I'm afraid I'd be
tempted.It does seem as if a woman had the right to be happy, even
if--"

Her own words frightened her.It was as if some hidden self, and not
she, had spoken.She hastened to point out the other side of the matter,
the insecurity of it, the disgrace.Like K., she insisted that no right
can be built out of a wrong.Tillie sat and smoothed her gloves.At
last, when Harriet paused in sheer panic, the girl rose."I know how you feel, and I don't want you to take the responsibility of
advising me," she said quietly."I guess my mind was made up anyhow.But
before I did it I just wanted to be sure that a decent woman would think
the way I do about it."And so, for a time, Tillie went out of the life of the Street as she
went out of Harriet's handsome rooms, quietly, unobtrusively, with calm
purpose in her eyes.The Lorenz house was being
painted for Christine's wedding.Johnny Rosenfeld, not perhaps of the
Street itself, but certainly pertaining to it, was learning to drive
Palmer Howe's new car, in mingled agony and bliss.He walked along the
Street, not "right foot, left foot," but "brake foot, clutch foot," and
took to calling off the vintage of passing cars."So-and-So 1910,"
he would say, with contempt in his voice.He spent more than he could
afford on a large streamer, meant to be fastened across the rear of the
automobile, which said, "Excuse our dust," and was inconsolable when
Palmer refused to let him use it.K. had yielded to Anna's insistence, and was boarding as well as
rooming at the Page house.The Street, rather snobbish to its occasional
floating population, was accepting and liking him.It found him tender,
infinitely human.And in return he found that this seemingly empty eddy
into which he had drifted was teeming with life.He busied himself with
small things, and found his outlook gradually less tinged with despair.When he found himself inclined to rail, he organized a baseball
club, and sent down to everlasting defeat the Linburgs, consisting of
cash-boys from Linden and Hofburg's department store.The Rosenfelds adored him, with the single exception of the head of
the family.The elder Rosenfeld having been "sent up," it was K. who
discovered that by having him consigned to the workhouse his family
would receive from the county some sixty-five cents a day for his labor.As this was exactly sixty-five cents a day more than he was worth to
them free, Mrs.Rosenfeld voiced the pious hope that he be kept there
forever.K. made no further attempt to avoid Max Wilson.Some day they would meet
face to face.He hoped, when it happened, they two might be alone; that
was all.Even had he not been bound by his promise to Sidney, flight
would have been foolish.The world was a small place, and, one way and
another, he had known many people.Wherever he went, there would be the
same chance.Other things being equal,--the eddy
and all that it meant--, he would not willingly take himself out of his
small share of Sidney's life.She was never to know what she meant to him, of course.He had scourged
his heart until it no longer shone in his eyes when he looked at her.But he was very human--not at all meek.There were plenty of days when
his philosophy lay in the dust and savage dogs of jealousy tore at it;
more than one evening when he threw himself face downward on the bed
and lay without moving for hours.And of these periods of despair he was
always heartily ashamed the next day.The meeting with Max Wilson took place early in September, and under
better circumstances than he could have hoped for.Sidney had come home for her weekly visit, and her mother's condition
had alarmed her for the first time.When Le Moyne came home at six
o'clock, he found her waiting for him in the hall."I am just a little frightened, K.," she said."Do you think mother is
looking quite well?""She has felt the heat, of course.The summer--I often think--"

"Her lips are blue!"She put her hands on his arm and looked up at him with appeal and
something of terror in her face.Thus cornered, he had to acknowledge that Anna had been out of sorts.It's tragic and absurd that I should be
caring for other people, when my own mother--"

She dropped her head on his arm, and he saw that she was crying.If he
made a gesture to draw her to him, she never knew it."I'm much braver than this in the hospital.K. was sorely tempted to tell her the truth and bring her back to the
little house: to their old evenings together, to seeing the younger
Wilson, not as the white god of the operating-room and the hospital, but
as the dandy of the Street and the neighbor of her childhood--back even
to Joe.But, with Anna's precarious health and Harriet's increasing engrossment
in her business, he felt it more and more necessary that Sidney go on
with her training.And there was another
point: it had been decided that Anna was not to know her condition.If
she was not worried she might live for years.There was no surer way to
make her suspect it than by bringing Sidney home.She insisted on coming downstairs, and
even sat with them on the balcony until the stars came out, talking
of Christine's trousseau, and, rather fretfully, of what she would do
without the parlors."You shall have your own boudoir upstairs," said Sidney valiantly."Katie can carry your tray up there.We are going to make the
sewing-room into your private sitting-room, and I shall nail the
machine-top down."When K. insisted on carrying her upstairs, she went in
a flutter.she said, when he had placed her on her bed."How can a clerk, bending over a ledger, be so muscular?When I have
callers, will it be all right for Katie to show them upstairs?"She dropped asleep before the doctor came; and when, at something after
eight, the door of the Wilson house slammed and a figure crossed the
street, it was not Ed at all, but the surgeon.Sidney had been talking rather more frankly than usual.Lately there
had been a reserve about her.K., listening intently that night, read
between words a story of small persecutions and jealousies.But the girl
minimized them, after her way."It's always hard for probationers," she said."I often think Miss
Harrison is trying my mettle."And now that Miss Gregg has said she will accept
me, it's really all over.The other nurses are wonderful--so kind and so
helpful.I hope I shall look well in my cap."A thousand contingencies
flashed through his mind.Sidney might grow to like her and bring her to
the house.Sidney might insist on the thing she always spoke of--that he
visit the hospital; and he would meet her, face to face.He could have
depended on a man to keep his secret.This girl with her somber eyes and
her threat to pay him out for what had happened to her--she meant danger
of a sort that no man could fight."Soon," said Sidney, through the warm darkness, "I shall have a cap,
and be always forgetting it and putting my hat on over it--the new ones
always do.One of the girls slept in hers the other night!They are
tulle, you know, and quite stiff, and it was the most erratic-looking
thing the next day!"It was then that the door across the street closed.Sidney did not
hear it, but K. bent forward.There was a part of his brain always
automatically on watch."I shall get my operating-room training, too," she went on."That is
the real romance of the hospital.A--a surgeon is a sort of hero in
a hospital.There was a lot of
excitement to-day.Even the probationers' table was talking about it.The figure across the Street was lighting a cigarette.Perhaps, after
all--

"Something tremendously difficult--I don't know what.Edwardes invented it, or whatever they
call it.They took a picture of the operating-room for the article.The photographer had to put on operating clothes and wrap the camera in
sterilized towels.It was the most thrilling thing, they say--"

Her voice died away as her eyes followed K.'s.Max, cigarette in
hand, was coming across, under the ailanthus tree.He hesitated on the
pavement, his eyes searching the shadowy balcony."My brother is not at home, so I came over.How select you are, with
your balcony!"K. had risen and pushed back his chair.Here in the darkness he could hold the situation for a moment.If he
could get Sidney into the house, the rest would not matter.Luckily, the
balcony was very dark.Le Moyne, and he knows who you are very
well, indeed."Didn't the Street beat the Linburgs
the other day?And I believe the Rosenfelds are in receipt of sixty-five
cents a day and considerable peace and quiet through you, Mr.You're the most popular man on the Street."Wilson is here to see
your mother--"

"Going," said Sidney.Wilson is a very great person, K., so be
polite to him."Max had roused at the sound of Le Moyne's voice, not to suspicion,
of course, but to memory.Without any apparent reason, he was back in
Berlin, tramping the country roads, and beside him--

"Wonderful night!""The mind's a curious thing, isn't it.In the
instant since Miss Page went through that window I've been to Berlin and
back!K. struck a match with his steady hands.Now that the thing had come, he
was glad to face it.In the flare, his quiet profile glowed against the
night."Perhaps my voice took you back to Berlin."Blackness had descended on them again, except
for the dull glow of K.The neighbors next door have a bad habit of sitting just inside the
curtains."Sidney will be back in a moment.I'll talk to you, if you'll
sit still."I've been here--in the city, I mean--for a year.Don't
forget it--Le Moyne.I've got a position in the gas office, clerical.I have reason to think I'm going to be moved
up.That will be twenty, maybe twenty-two."Wilson stirred, but he found no adequate words.Only a part of what K.
said got to him.For a moment he was back in a famous clinic, and this
man across from him--it was not believable!"It's not hard work, and it's safe.If I make a mistake there's no life
hanging on it.Once I made a blunder, a month or two ago.It cost me three dollars out of my own pocket.Wilson's voice showed that he was more than incredulous; he was
profoundly moved.When a year
went by--the Titanic had gone down, and nobody knew but what you were on
it--we gave up.I--in June we put up a tablet for you at the college.I
went down for the--for the services.""Let it stay," said K. quietly."I'm dead as far as the college goes,
anyhow.And, for Heaven's sake,
don't be sorry for me.I'm more contented than I've been for a long
time."The wonder in Wilson's voice was giving way to irritation.Why, good Heavens, man, I did your
operation to-day, and I've been blowing about it ever since."When that
happened I gave up.All a man in our profession has is a certain method,
knowledge--call it what you like,--and faith in himself.I lost my
self-confidence; that's all.For about a year I was
damned sorry for myself."If every surgeon gave up because he lost cases--I've just told you I
did your operation to-day.There was just a chance for the man, and I
took my courage in my hands and tried it.K. rose rather wearily and emptied his pipe over the balcony rail.Pipe in hand, he stood staring out at the ailanthus tree with its crown
of stars.Instead of the Street with its quiet houses, he saw the men
he had known and worked with and taught, his friends who spoke his
language, who had loved him, many of them, gathered about a bronze
tablet set in a wall of the old college; he saw their earnest faces and
grave eyes.He heard--

He heard the soft rustle of Sidney's dress as she came into the little
room behind them.CHAPTER XIII


A few days after Wilson's recognition of K., two most exciting things
happened to Sidney.One was that Christine asked her to be maid of honor
at her wedding.She was accepted, and
given her cap.Because she could not get home that night, and because the little house
had no telephone, she wrote the news to her mother and sent a note to Le
Moyne:

DEAR K.,--I am accepted, and IT is on my head at this minute.I am as
conscious of it as if it were a halo, and as if I had done something to
deserve it, instead of just hoping that someday I shall.I am writing
this on the bureau, so that when I lift my eyes I may see It.I am
afraid just now I am thinking more of the cap than of what it means.Very soon I shall slip down and show it to the ward.I shall go to the door when the night nurse is busy somewhere, and
turn all around and let them see it, without saying a word.You have been very good to me, dear K. It is you who have made possible
this happiness of mine to-night.I am promising myself to be very good,
and not so vain, and to love my enemies--, although I have none now.Miss Harrison has just congratulated me most kindly, and I am sure poor
Joe has both forgiven and forgotten.K. found the note on the hall table when he got home that night, and
carried it upstairs to read.Whatever faint hope he might have had that
her youth would prevent her acceptance he knew now was over.With the
letter in his hand, he sat by his table and looked ahead into the empty
years.But more and more the life of the hospital would engross her.He
surmised, too, very shrewdly, that, had he ever had a hope that she
might come to care for him, his very presence in the little house
militated against him.There was none of the illusion of separation;
he was always there, like Katie.When she opened the door, she called
"Mother" from the hall.If Anna did not answer, she called him, in much
the same voice.He had built a wall of philosophy that had withstood even Wilson's
recognition and protest.But enduring philosophy comes only with time;
and he was young.Now and then all his defenses crumbled before a
passion that, when he dared to face it, shook him by its very strength.And that day all his stoicism went down before Sidney's letter.Its very
frankness and affection hurt--not that he did not want her affection;
but he craved so much more.He threw himself face down on the bed, with
the paper crushed in his hand.Sidney's letter was not the only one he received that day.When, in
response to Katie's summons, he rose heavily and prepared for dinner, he
found an unopened envelope on the table.It was from Max Wilson:--

DEAR LE MOYNE,--I have been going around in a sort of haze all day.The
fact that I only heard your voice and scarcely saw you last night has
made the whole thing even more unreal.I have a feeling of delicacy about trying to see you again so soon.I'm
bound to respect your seclusion.But there are some things that have got
to be discussed.You said last night that things were "different" with you.Do you know any man in our
profession who has not?And, for fear you think I do not know what I am
talking about, the thing was threshed out at the State Society when the
question of the tablet came up.Old Barnes got up and said: "Gentlemen,
all of us live more or less in glass houses.Let him who is without
guilt among us throw the first stone!"I took my little car and drove around the
country roads, and the farther I went the more outrageous your position
became.I'm not going to write any rot about the world needing men like
you, although it's true enough.You working in
a gas office, while old O'Hara bungles and hacks, and I struggle along
on what I learned from you!It takes courage to step down from the pinnacle you stood on.So it's
not cowardice that has set you down here.The first, and best, is for you to go back.No one has taken your place, because no one could do the work.But if
that's out of the question,--and only you know that, for only you know
the facts,--the next best thing is this, and in all humility I make the
suggestion.Take the State exams under your present name, and when you've got your
certificate, come in with me.I'll be getting a
damn sight more than I give.It is a curious fact that a man who is absolutely untrustworthy about
women is often the soul of honor to other men.The younger Wilson,
taking his pleasures lightly and not too discriminatingly, was making an
offer that meant his ultimate eclipse, and doing it cheerfully, with his
eyes open.It was like Max to make such an offer, like him to make it
as if he were asking a favor and not conferring one.But the offer left
him untempted.He had weighed himself in the balance, and found himself
wanting.No tablet on the college wall could change that.And when,
late that night, Wilson found him on the balcony and added appeal to
argument, the situation remained unchanged.He realized its hopelessness
when K. lapsed into whimsical humor."I'm not absolutely useless where I am, you know, Max," he said."I've
raised three tomato plants and a family of kittens this summer, helped
to plan a trousseau, assisted in selecting wall-paper for the room just
inside,--did you notice it?--and developed a boy pitcher with a ball
that twists around the bat like a Colles fracture around a splint!""If you're going to be humorous--"

"My dear fellow," said K. quietly, "if I had no sense of humor, I should
go upstairs to-night, turn on the gas, and make a stertorous entrance
into eternity.By the way, that's something I forgot!"Among my other activities, I wired the parlor for
electric light.The bride-to-be expects some electroliers as wedding
gifts, and--"

Wilson rose and flung his cigarette into the grass.K. rose with him, and all the suppressed feeling of the interview was
crowded into his last few words."I'm not as ungrateful as you think, Max," he said."I--you've helped
a lot.I'm as well off as I deserve to be, and
better.Wilson's unexpected magnanimity put K. in a curious position--left him,
as it were, with a divided allegiance.Sidney's frank infatuation for
the young surgeon was growing.And where before
he might have felt justified in going to the length of warning her, now
his hands were tied.More than once he had
taken Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Le Moyne, handicapped at
every turn, found himself facing two alternatives, one but little better
than the other.The affair might run a legitimate course, ending in
marriage--a year of happiness for her, and then what marriage with
Max, as he knew him, would inevitably mean: wanderings away, remorseful
returns to her, infidelities, misery.Or, it might be less serious but
almost equally unhappy for her.Max might throw caution to the winds,
pursue her for a time,--K. had seen him do this,--and then, growing
tired, change to some new attraction.In either case, he could only wait
and watch, eating his heart out during the long evenings when Anna read
her "Daily Thoughts" upstairs and he sat alone with his pipe on the
balcony.Sidney went on night duty shortly after her acceptance.All of her
orderly young life had been divided into two parts: day, when one
played or worked, and night, when one slept.Now she was compelled to
a readjustment: one worked in the night and slept in the day.At the end of her first night report Sidney
added what she could remember of a little verse of Stevenson's.She
added it to the end of her general report, which was to the effect that
everything had been quiet during the night except the neighborhood."And does it not seem hard to you,
      When all the sky is clear and blue,
      And I should like so much to play,
      To have to go to bed by day?"The day assistant happened on the report, and was quite scandalized."If the night nurses are to spend their time making up poetry," she
said crossly, "we'd better change this hospital into a young ladies'
seminary.If she wants to complain about the noise in the street, she
should do so in proper form.""I don't think she made it up," said the Head, trying not to smile."I've heard something like it somewhere, and, what with the heat and the
noise of traffic, I don't see how any of them get any sleep."But, because discipline must be observed, she wrote on the slip the
assistant carried around: "Please submit night reports in prose."She tumbled into her low bed at nine o'clock
in the morning, those days, with her splendid hair neatly braided down
her back and her prayers said, and immediately her active young mind
filled with images--Christine's wedding, Dr.Max passing the door of her
old ward and she not there, Joe--even Tillie, whose story was now the
sensation of the Street.A few months before she would not have cared
to think of Tillie.She would have retired her into the land of
things-one-must-forget.But the Street's conventions were not holding
Sidney's thoughts now.She puzzled over Tillie a great deal, and over
Grace and her kind.On her first night on duty, a girl had been brought in from the Avenue.She had taken a poison--nobody knew just what.When the internes had
tried to find out, she had only said: "What's the use?"Sidney kept asking herself, "Why?"those mornings when she could not get
to sleep.People were kind--men were kind, really,--and yet, for some
reason or other, those things had to be.After a time Sidney would doze fitfully.But by three o'clock she was
always up and dressing.Lack of
sleep wrote hollows around her eyes and killed some of her bright color.Between three and four o'clock in the morning she was overwhelmed on
duty by a perfect madness of sleep.There was a penalty for sleeping on
duty.The old night watchman had a way of slipping up on one nodding.The night nurses wished they might fasten a bell on him!Luckily, at four came early-morning temperatures; that roused her.And
after that came the clatter of early milk-wagons and the rose hues of
dawn over the roofs.Twice in the night, once at supper and again toward
dawn, she drank strong black coffee.But after a week or two her nerves
were stretched taut as a string.Her station was in a small room close to her three wards.But she sat
very little, as a matter of fact.Her responsibility was heavy on her;
she made frequent rounds.The late summer nights were fitful, feverish;
the darkened wards stretched away like caverns from the dim light near
the door.And from out of these caverns came petulant voices, uneasy
movements, the banging of a cup on a bedside, which was the signal of
thirst.To them, perhaps just
a little weary with time and much service, the banging cup meant not so
much thirst as annoyance."Don't jump like that, child; they're not parched, you know.""But if you have a fever and are thirsty--"

"Thirsty nothing!"Then," Sidney would say, rising resolutely, "they are going to see me."Gradually the older girls saw that she would not save herself.They
liked her very much, and they, too, had started in with willing feet
and tender hands; but the thousand and one demands of their service
had drained them dry.They were efficient, cool-headed, quick-thinking
machines, doing their best, of course, but differing from Sidney in that
their service was of the mind, while hers was of the heart.To them,
pain was a thing to be recorded on a report; to Sidney, it was written
on the tablets of her soul.Carlotta Harrison went on night duty at the same time--her last night
service, as it was Sidney's first.She had
charge of the three wards on the floor just below Sidney, and of the
ward into which all emergency cases were taken.It was a difficult
service, perhaps the most difficult in the house.Scarcely a night went
by without its patrol or ambulance case.Ordinarily, the emergency ward
had its own night nurse.Belated
vacations and illness had depleted the training-school.Carlotta, given
double duty, merely shrugged her shoulders."I've always had things pretty hard here," she commented briefly."When I go out, I'll either be competent enough to run a whole hospital
singlehanded, or I'll be carried out feet first."Sidney was glad to have her so near.She knew her better than she knew
the other nurses.Small emergencies were constantly arising and finding
her at a loss.Once at least every night, Miss Harrison would hear a
soft hiss from the back staircase that connected the two floors, and,
going out, would see Sidney's flushed face and slightly crooked cap
bending over the stair-rail."I'm dreadfully sorry to bother you," she would say, "but So-and-So
won't have a fever bath"; or, "I've a woman here who refuses her
medicine."Then would follow rapid questions and equally rapid answers.Much as Carlotta disliked and feared the girl overhead, it never
occurred to her to refuse her assistance.Perhaps the angels who keep
the great record will put that to her credit.Sidney saw her first death shortly after she went on night duty.It was
the most terrible experience of all her life; and yet, as death goes, it
was quiet enough.So gradual was it that Sidney, with K.'s little watch
in hand, was not sure exactly when it happened.The light was very dim
behind the little screen.One moment the sheet was quivering slightly
under the struggle for breath, the next it was still.That life, so potential, so tremendous a
thing, could end so ignominiously, that the long battle should terminate
always in this capitulation--it seemed to her that she could not stand
it.Added to all her other new problems of living was this one of dying.She made mistakes, of course, which the kindly nurses forgot to
report--basins left about, errors on her records.She rinsed her
thermometer in hot water one night, and startled an interne by sending
him word that Mary McGuire's temperature was a hundred and ten degrees.She let a delirious patient escape from the ward another night and go
airily down the fire-escape before she discovered what had happened!Then she distinguished herself by flying down the iron staircase and
bringing the runaway back single-handed.For Christine's wedding the Street threw off its drab attire and assumed
a wedding garment.In the beginning it was incredulous about some of the
details."An awning from the house door to the curbstone, and a policeman!"Rosenfeld, who was finding steady employment at the Lorenz
house."And another awning at the church, with a red carpet!"Rosenfeld had arrived home and was making up arrears of rest and
recreation."Why do they ask 'em if they don't trust 'em?"But the mention of the policemen had been unfortunate.It recalled to
him many things that were better forgotten.He rose and scowled at his
wife."You tell Johnny something for me," he snarled."You tell him when he
sees his father walking down street, and he sittin' up there alone on
that automobile, I want him to stop and pick me up when I hail him.Me
walking, while my son swells around in a car!"You let me hear of him road-housin', and
I'll kill him!"The wedding was to be at five o'clock.This, in itself, defied all
traditions of the Street, which was either married in the very early
morning at the Catholic church or at eight o'clock in the evening at
the Presbyterian.There was something reckless about five o'clock.It had a queer feeling that perhaps such a
marriage was not quite legal.The question of what to wear became, for the men, an earnest one.Ed
resurrected an old black frock-coat and had a "V" of black cambric set
in the vest.Jenkins, the grocer, rented a cutaway, and bought a
new Panama to wear with it.The deaf-and-dumb book agent who boarded at
McKees', and who, by reason of his affliction, was calmly ignorant of
the excitement around him, wore a borrowed dress-suit, and considered
himself to the end of his days the only properly attired man in the
church.The younger Wilson was to be one of the ushers.When the newspapers came
out with the published list and this was discovered, as well as that
Sidney was the maid of honor, there was a distinct quiver through the
hospital training-school.A probationer was authorized to find out
particulars.It was the day of the wedding then, and Sidney, who had
not been to bed at all, was sitting in a sunny window in the Dormitory
Annex, drying her hair."I--I just wonder," she said, "if you would let some of the girls come
in to see you when you're dressed?""It's awfully thrilling, isn't it?"Are you going to walk down the aisle with him?"They had a rehearsal last night, but of course I was not
there.The probationer had been instructed to find out other things; so she set
to work with a fan at Sidney's hair."He's awfully good-looking, isn't he?"She was not ignorant of the methods of the school.If
this girl was pumping her--

"I'll have to think that over," she said, with a glint of mischief in
her eyes."When you know a person terribly well, you hardly know whether
he's good-looking or not.""I suppose," said the probationer, running the long strands of Sidney's
hair through her fingers, "that when you are at home you see him often."Sidney got off the window-sill, and, taking the probationer smilingly by
the shoulders, faced her toward the door."You go back to the girls," she said, "and tell them to come in and see
me when I am dressed, and tell them this: I don't know whether I am to
walk down the aisle with Dr.She shoved the probationer out into the hall and locked the door behind
her.That message in its entirety reached Carlotta Harrison.Sidney must be very sure
of herself.She, too, had not slept during the day.When the probationer who
had brought her the report had gone out, she lay in her long white
night-gown, hands clasped under her head, and stared at the vault-like
ceiling of her little room.She saw there Sidney in her white dress going down the aisle of the
church; she saw the group around the altar; and, as surely as she lay
there, she knew that Max Wilson's eyes would be, not on the bride, but
on the girl who stood beside her.The curious thing was that Carlotta felt that she could stop the wedding
if she wanted to.She'd happened on a bit of information--many a wedding
had been stopped for less.It rather obsessed her to think of stopping
the wedding, so that Sidney and Max would not walk down the aisle
together.There came, at last, an hour before the wedding, a lull in the feverish
activities of the previous month.In the Lorenz
kitchen, piles of plates, <DW64> waiters, ice-cream freezers, and Mrs.In the attic, in the center of a
sheet, before a toilet-table which had been carried upstairs for her
benefit, sat, on this her day of days, the bride.All the second story
had been prepared for guests and presents.Florists were still busy in the room below.Bridesmaids were clustered
on the little staircase, bending over at each new ring of the bell and
calling reports to Christine through the closed door:--

"Another wooden box, Christine.What will you
ever do with them all?"Here's another of the neighbors who wants to see how you
look.Do say you can't have any visitors now."Christine sat alone in the center of her sheet.The bridesmaids had been
sternly forbidden to come into her room."I haven't had a chance to think for a month," she said."And I've got
some things I've got to think out."But, when Sidney came, she sent for her.Sidney found her sitting on a
stiff chair, in her wedding gown, with her veil spread out on a small
stand.And, after Sidney had kissed her:--

"I've a good mind not to do it.""You're tired and nervous, that's all."But that isn't what's wrong with me.Throw that veil
some place and sit down."Christine was undoubtedly rouged, a very delicate touch.Sidney thought
brides should be rather pale.But under her eyes were lines that Sidney
had never seen there before."I'm not going to be foolish, Sidney.I'll go through with it, of
course.It would put mamma in her grave if I made a scene now.""Palmer gave his bachelor dinner at the Country Club last night.Somebody called father up to-day and
said that Palmer had emptied a bottle of wine into the piano.He hasn't
been here to-day."And as for the other--perhaps it wasn't Palmer who did
it."Three months before, perhaps, Sidney could not have comforted her; but
three months had made a change in Sidney.The complacent sophistries
of her girlhood no longer answered for truth.She put her arms around
Christine's shoulders."A man who drinks is a broken reed," said Christine."That's what I'm
going to marry and lean on the rest of my life--a broken reed.She got up quickly, and, trailing her long satin train across the floor,
bolted the door.Then from inside her corsage she brought out and held
to Sidney a letter.It was very short; Sidney read it at a glance:--

Ask your future husband if he knows a girl at 213 ---- Avenue.Three months before, the Avenue would have meant nothing to Sidney.Christine, more sophisticated, had always known.Quite suddenly Sidney knew who the girl at 213 ---- Avenue was.The
paper she held in her hand was hospital paper with the heading torn off.The whole sordid story lay before her: Grace Irving, with her thin face
and cropped hair, and the newspaper on the floor of the ward beside her!One of the bridesmaids thumped violently on the door outside."Another electric lamp," she called excitedly through the door."You see," Christine said drearily."I have received another electric
lamp, and Palmer is downstairs!I've got to go through with it, I
suppose.The only difference between me and other brides is that I know
what I'm getting."It's too late to do anything else.I am not going to give this
neighborhood anything to talk about."She picked up her veil and set the coronet on her head.Sidney stood
with the letter in her hands.'s answers to her hot question
had been this:--

"There is no sense in looking back unless it helps us to look ahead.What your little girl of the ward has been is not so important as what
she is going to be.""Even granting this to be true," she said to Christine slowly,--"and it
may only be malicious after all, Christine,--it's surely over and done
with.It's not Palmer's past that concerns you now; it's his future with
you, isn't it?"A band of duchesse lace rose
like a coronet from her soft hair, and from it, sweeping to the end of
her train, fell fold after fold of soft tulle.She arranged the coronet
carefully with small pearl-topped pins.Then she rose and put her hands
on Sidney's shoulders."The simple truth is," she said quietly, "that I might hold Palmer if
I cared--terribly.It's my pride
that's hurt, nothing else."And thus did Christine Lorenz go down to her wedding.Sidney stood for a moment, her eyes on the letter she held.Already, in
her new philosophy, she had learned many strange things.One of them was
this: that women like Grace Irving did not betray their lovers; that the
code of the underworld was "death to the squealer"; that one played the
game, and won or lost, and if he lost, took his medicine.Somebody else in the hospital who knew her story, of course.Before going downstairs, Sidney placed the letter in a saucer and set
fire to it with a match.Some of the radiance had died out of her eyes.The alley, however, was
rather confused by certain things.For instance, it regarded the awning
as essentially for the carriage guests, and showed a tendency to duck
in under the side when no one was looking.Rosenfeld absolutely
refused to take the usher's arm which was offered her, and said she
guessed she was able to walk up alone.Johnny Rosenfeld came, as befitted his position, in a complete
chauffeur's outfit of leather cap and leggings, with the shield that was
his State license pinned over his heart.The Street came decorously, albeit with a degree of uncertainty as to
supper.Should they put something on the stove before they left, in case
only ice cream and cake were served at the house?Or was it just as well
to trust to luck, and, if the Lorenz supper proved inadequate, to sit
down to a cold snack when they got home?To K., sitting in the back of the church between Harriet and Anna, the
wedding was Sidney--Sidney only.He watched her first steps down the
aisle, saw her chin go up as she gained poise and confidence, watched
the swinging of her young figure in its gauzy white as she passed him
and went forward past the long rows of craning necks.Afterward he could
not remember the wedding party at all.The service for him was Sidney,
rather awed and very serious, beside the altar.It was Sidney who came
down the aisle to the triumphant strains of the wedding march, Sidney
with Max beside her!On his right sat Harriet, having reached the first pinnacle of her
new career.They were more than
that--they were triumphant.Sitting there, she cast comprehensive eyes
over the church, filled with potential brides.To Harriet, then, that October afternoon was a future of endless lace
and chiffon, the joy of creation, triumph eclipsing triumph.But to
Anna, watching the ceremony with blurred eyes and ineffectual bluish
lips, was coming her hour.Sitting back in the pew, with her hands
folded over her prayer-book, she said a little prayer for her straight
young daughter, facing out from the altar with clear, unafraid eyes.As Sidney and Max drew near the door, Joe Drummond, who had been
standing at the back of the church, turned quickly and went out.He
stumbled, rather, as if he could not see.CHAPTER XIV


The supper at the White Springs Hotel had not been the last supper
Carlotta Harrison and Max Wilson had taken together.Carlotta had
selected for her vacation a small town within easy motoring distance of
the city, and two or three times during her two weeks off duty Wilson
had gone out to see her.For once that he could see Sidney, he saw Carlotta twice.She knew quite well the kind of man with whom she was dealing--that he
would pay as little as possible.But she knew, too, that, let him want a
thing enough, he would pay any price for it, even marriage.The very ardor in her face was in her favor.She would put the thing
through, and show those puling nurses, with their pious eyes and evening
prayers, a thing or two.During that entire vacation he never saw her in anything more elaborate
than the simplest of white dresses modestly open at the throat, sleeves
rolled up to show her satiny arms.There were no other boarders at the
little farmhouse.She sat for hours in the summer evenings in the square
yard filled with apple trees that bordered the highway, carefully
posed over a book, but with her keen eyes always on the road.She read
Browning, Emerson, Swinburne.Once he found her with a book that she
hastily concealed.He insisted on seeing it, and secured it.Confronted with it, she blushed and dropped her
eyes.His delighted vanity found in it the most insidious of compliments, as
she had intended."I feel such an idiot when I am with you," she said."I wanted to know a
little more about the things you do."That put their relationship on a new and advanced basis.Thereafter
he occasionally talked surgery instead of sentiment.His work, a sealed book to his women before,
lay open to her.Now and then their professional discussions ended in something
different.I can talk
shop with you without either shocking or nauseating you.You are the
most intelligent woman I know--and one of the prettiest."He had stopped the machine on the crest of a hill for the ostensible
purpose of admiring the view."As long as you talk shop," she said, "I feel that there is nothing
wrong in our being together; but when you say the other thing--"

"Is it wrong to tell a pretty woman you admire her?"He twisted himself around in the seat and sat looking at her."The loveliest mouth in the world!"She had expected it for at least a week, but her surprise was well done.Well done also was her silence during the homeward ride.No, she was not angry, she said.It was only that he had set her
thinking.When she got out of the car, she bade him good-night and
good-bye.After that nothing could have kept him away, and she knew it."Man demands both danger and play; therefore he selects woman as the
most dangerous of toys."A spice of danger had entered into their
relationship.He motored out to the farm the next day, to be told that Miss Harrison
had gone for a long walk and had not said when she would be back.Every man likes to think that
he is a bit of a devil.Max settled his tie, and, leaving his
car outside the whitewashed fence, departed blithely on foot in the
direction Carlotta had taken.He found her, face down, under a tree,
looking pale and worn and bearing all the evidence of a severe mental
struggle.She rose in confusion when she heard his step, and retreated a
foot or two, with her hands out before her.I--I have got to
have a little time alone.He knew it was play-acting, but rather liked it; and, because he was
quite as skillful as she was, he struck a match on the trunk of the tree
and lighted a cigarette before he answered."I was afraid of this," he said, playing up.I am not really a villain, Carlotta."It was the first time he had used her name."Sit down and let us talk things over."She sat down at a safe distance, and looked across the little clearing
to him with the somber eyes that were her great asset."You can afford to be very calm," she said, "because this is only play
to you; I know it.I'm a good listener and
not--unattractive.But what is play for you is not necessarily play for
me.For the first time, he found himself believing in her sincerity.If she cried--he was at
the mercy of any woman who cried.This sort of thing cannot go on, Dr.She did cry then--real tears; and he went over beside her and took her
in his arms.You make me feel like
a scoundrel, and I've only been taking a little bit of happiness.Max, and kissed her again on the lips.The one element Carlotta had left out of her calculations was herself.She had known the man, had taken the situation at its proper value.But
she had left out this important factor in the equation,--that factor
which in every relationship between man and woman determines the
equation,--the woman.Into her calculating ambition had come a new and destroying element.She
who, like K. in his little room on the Street, had put aside love and
the things thereof, found that it would not be put aside.By the end of
her short vacation Carlotta Harrison was wildly in love with the younger
Wilson.They continued to meet, not as often as before, but once a week,
perhaps.The meetings were full of danger now; and if for the girl they
lost by this quality, they gained attraction for the man.She was shrewd
enough to realize her own situation.She
cared, and he did not.It was all a game now, not hers.All women are intuitive; women in love are dangerously so.As well as
she knew that his passion for her was not the real thing, so also she
realized that there was growing up in his heart something akin to the
real thing for Sidney Page.Suspicion became certainty after a talk
they had over the supper table at a country road-house the day after
Christine's wedding."How was the wedding--tiresome?"There's always something thrilling to me in a man tying
himself up for life to one woman."That's not exactly the Law and the Prophets, is it?"To think of selecting out of all the world one woman,
and electing to spend the rest of one's days with her!Although--"

His eyes looked past Carlotta into distance."Sidney Page was one of the bridesmaids," he said irrelevantly."She was
lovelier than the bride.""Pretty, but stupid," said Carlotta.I've really tried to
teach her things, but--you know--" She shrugged her shoulders.If there was a twinkle in his eye, he
veiled it discreetly.But, once again in the machine, he bent over and
put his cheek against hers.You're jealous," he said exultantly.Nevertheless, although he might smile, the image of Sidney lay very
close to his heart those autumn days.Sidney came off night duty the middle of November.The night duty had
been a time of comparative peace to Carlotta.Max could bring Sidney back to the hospital in his car.Sidney's half-days at home were occasions for agonies of jealousy on
Carlotta's part.On such an occasion, a month after the wedding, she
could not contain herself.She pleaded her old excuse of headache, and
took the trolley to a point near the end of the Street.After twilight
fell, she slowly walked the length of the Street.Christine and Palmer
had not returned from their wedding journey.The November evening was
not cold, and on the little balcony sat Sidney and Dr.K. was
there, too, had she only known it, sitting back in the shadow and saying
little, his steady eyes on Sidney's profile.She went on down the Street in a frenzy
of jealous anger.After that two ideas ran concurrent in Carlotta's mind: one was to get
Sidney out of the way, the other was to make Wilson propose to her.In
her heart she knew that on the first depended the second.A week later she made the same frantic excursion, but with a different
result.Sidney was not in sight, or Wilson.But standing on the wooden
doorstep of the little house was Le Moyne.The ailanthus trees were
bare at that time, throwing gaunt arms upward to the November sky.The
street-lamp, which in the summer left the doorstep in the shadow, now
shone through the branches and threw into strong relief Le Moyne's tall
figure and set face.She went on, startled, her busy brain scheming anew.It was the first time
she had known that K. lived in the Page house.It gave her a sense of
uncertainty and deadly fear.She made her first friendly overture of many days to Sidney the
following day.They met in the locker-room in the basement where the
street clothing for the ward patients was kept.Here, rolled in bundles
and ticketed, side by side lay the heterogeneous garments in which
the patients had met accident or illness.Rags and tidiness, filth and
cleanliness, lay almost touching.Far away on the other side of the white-washed basement, men were
unloading gleaming cans of milk.Floods of sunlight came down the
cellar-way, touching their white coats and turning the cans to silver.Everywhere was the religion of the hospital, which is order.Sidney, harking back from recent slights to the staircase conversation
of her night duty, smiled at Carlotta cheerfully."Grace Irving is going out to-day.When one remembers how ill she was and how we thought she could not
live, it's rather a triumph, isn't it?"Sidney examined with some dismay the elaborate negligee garments in her
hand."She can't go out in those; I shall have to lend her something."A
little of the light died out of her face."She's had a hard fight, and
she has won," she said."But when I think of what she's probably going
back to--"

Carlotta shrugged her shoulders."It's all in the day's work," she observed indifferently."You can take
them up into the kitchen and give them steady work paring potatoes, or
put them in the laundry ironing.She drew a package from the locker and looked at it ruefully."Well, what do you know about this?Here's a woman who came in in a
nightgown and pair of slippers.And now she wants to go out in half an
hour!"She turned, on her way out of the locker-room, and shot a quick glance
at Sidney."I happened to be on your street the other night," she said."You live
across the street from Wilsons', don't you?""I thought so; I had heard you speak of the house.Your--your brother
was standing on the steps."It isn't really
right to call him a roomer; he's one of the family now."'s name had struck an always responsive chord in Sidney.The two girls
went toward the elevator together.With a very little encouragement,
Sidney talked of K. She was pleased at Miss Harrison's friendly tone,
glad that things were all right between them again.At her floor, she
put a timid hand on the girl's arm."I was afraid I had offended you or displeased you," she said."I'm so
glad it isn't so."Things were not going any too well with K. True, he had received his
promotion at the office, and with this present affluence of twenty-two
dollars a week he was able to do several things.Rosenfeld now
washed and ironed one day a week at the little house, so that Katie
might have more time to look after Anna.He had increased also the
amount of money that he periodically sent East.The thing that rankled and filled him with a sense
of failure was Max Wilson's attitude.It was not unfriendly; it was,
indeed, consistently respectful, almost reverential.But he clearly
considered Le Moyne's position absurd.There was no true comradeship between the two men; but there was
beginning to be constant association, and lately a certain amount of
friction.Wilson began to bring all his problems to Le Moyne.There were long
consultations in that small upper room.Perhaps more than one man or
woman who did not know of K.'s existence owed his life to him that fall.Cases began to come in to him
from the surrounding towns.To his own daring was added a new and
remarkable technique.But Le Moyne, who had found resignation if not
content, was once again in touch with the work he loved.There were
times when, having thrashed a case out together and outlined the next
day's work for Max, he would walk for hours into the night out over the
hills, fighting his battle.The longing was on him to be in the thick
of things again.The thought of the gas office and its deadly round
sickened him.It was on one of his long walks that K. found Tillie.It was December then, gray and raw, with a wet snow that changed to
rain as it fell.The country roads were ankle-deep with mud, the wayside
paths thick with sodden leaves.The dreariness of the countryside that
Saturday afternoon suited his mood.He had ridden to the end of the
street-car line, and started his walk from there.As was his custom, he
wore no overcoat, but a short sweater under his coat.Somewhere along
the road he had picked up a mongrel dog, and, as if in sheer desire for
human society, it trotted companionably at his heels.Seven miles from the end of the car line he found a road-house, and
stopped in for a glass of Scotch.The dog
went in with him, and stood looking up into his face.It was as if he
submitted, but wondered why this indoors, with the scents of the road
ahead and the trails of rabbits over the fields.The house was set in a valley at the foot of two hills.Through the mist
of the December afternoon, it had loomed pleasantly before him.The door
was ajar, and he stepped into a little hall covered with ingrain carpet.To the right was the dining-room, the table covered with a white cloth,
and in its exact center an uncompromising bunch of dried flowers.To the
left, the typical parlor of such places.It might have been the parlor
of the White Springs Hotel in duplicate, plush self-rocker and all.Over
everything was silence and a pervading smell of fresh varnish.The house
was aggressive with new paint--the sagging old floors shone with it, the
doors gleamed.called K.

There were slow footsteps upstairs, the closing of a bureau drawer,
the rustle of a woman's dress coming down the stairs.K., standing
uncertainly on a carpet oasis that was the center of the parlor varnish,
stripped off his sweater.he said to the unseen female on the
staircase.She put a hand against the
doorframe to steady herself.Tillie surely, but a new Tillie!With her
hair loosened around her face, a fresh blue chintz dress open at the
throat, a black velvet bow on her breast, here was a Tillie fuller,
infinitely more attractive, than he had remembered her.But she did not
smile at him.There was something about her eyes not unlike the dog's
expression, submissive, but questioning."Well, you've found me, Mr.And, when he held out his hand,
smiling: "I just had to do it, Mr.You look mighty fine and--happy, Tillie."Schwitter's gone to the postoffice.Will you have a cup of tea, or will you have something else?"The instinct of the Street was still strong in Tillie.The Street did
not approve of "something else.""Scotch-and-soda," said Le Moyne."And shall I buy a ticket for you to
punch?"He was sorry he had made the blunder.Evidently the Street and all that pertained was a sore subject.It was for this that she had exchanged
the virginal integrity of her life at Mrs.McKee's--for this wind-swept
little house, tidily ugly, infinitely lonely.There were two crayon
enlargements over the mantel.The
other was the paper-doll wife.K. wondered what curious instinct of
self-abnegation had caused Tillie to leave the wife there undisturbed.Back of its position of honor he saw the girl's realization of her own
situation.On a wooden shelf, exactly between the two pictures, was
another vase of dried flowers.Tillie brought the Scotch, already mixed, in a tall glass.K. would
have preferred to mix it himself, but the Scotch was good."You gave me a turn at first," said Tillie."But I am right glad to see
you, Mr.Now that the roads are bad, nobody comes very much.Until now, K. and Tillie, when they met, had met conversationally on the
common ground of food.They no longer had that, and between them both
lay like a barrier their last conversation.More attractive it certainly was,
but happy?There was a wistfulness about Tillie's mouth that set him
wondering."He's about the best man on earth.He's never said a cross word to
me--even at first, when I was panicky and scared at every sound.""I burned a lot of victuals when I first came, running off and hiding
when I heard people around the place.It used to seem to me that what
I'd done was written on my face.Tillie glanced up at the two pictures over the mantel."Sometimes it is--when he comes in tired, and I've a chicken ready or
some fried ham and eggs for his supper, and I see him begin to look
rested.He lights his pipe, and many an evening he helps me with the
dishes."I wouldn't go back to where I was, but I am not happy, Mr.This place is his, and he'd like a boy to come into it
when he's gone.if I did have one; what would it be?"'s eyes followed hers to the picture and the everlastings underneath."And she--there isn't any prospect of her--?"There was no solution to Tillie's problem.Le Moyne, standing on the
hearth and looking down at her, realized that, after all, Tillie must
work out her own salvation.They talked far into the growing twilight of the afternoon.Tillie was
hungry for news of the Street: must know of Christine's wedding, of
Harriet, of Sidney in her hospital.And when he had told her all, she
sat silent, rolling her handkerchief in her fingers.Then:--

"Take the four of us," she said suddenly,--"Christine Lorenz and Sidney
Page and Miss Harriet and me,--and which one would you have picked to
go wrong like this?I guess, from the looks of things, most folks would
have thought it would be the Lorenz girl.They'd have picked Harriet
Kennedy for the hospital, and me for the dressmaking, and it would have
been Sidney Page that got married and had an automobile.She looked up at K. shrewdly.They didn't know me, and I
heard them talking.They said Sidney Page was going to marry Dr.As she
stood before him she looked up into his face."If you like her as well as I think you do, Mr.Le Moyne, you won't let
him get her.""I am afraid that's not up to me, is it?What would I do with a wife,
Tillie?"I guess, in the
long run, that would count more than money."That was what K. took home with him after his encounter with Tillie.He
pondered it on his way back to the street-car, as he struggled against
the wind.Wagon-tracks along the road were
filled with water and had begun to freeze.The rain had turned to a
driving sleet that cut his face.Halfway to the trolley line, the dog
turned off into a by-road.The dog stared after
him, one foot raised.Once again his eyes were like Tillie's, as she had
waved good-bye from the porch.His head sunk on his breast, K. covered miles of road with his long,
swinging pace, and fought his battle.Was Tillie right, after all, and
had he been wrong?Why should he efface himself, if it meant Sidney's
unhappiness?Why not accept Wilson's offer and start over again?Then
if things went well--the temptation was strong that stormy afternoon.He
put it from him at last, because of the conviction that whatever he did
would make no change in Sidney's ultimate decision.If she cared enough
for Wilson, she would marry him.CHAPTER XV


Palmer and Christine returned from their wedding trip the day K.
discovered Tillie.Anna Page made much of the arrival, insisted on
dinner for them that night at the little house, must help Christine
unpack her trunks and arrange her wedding gifts about the apartment.She
was brighter than she had been for days, more interested.The wonders of
the trousseau filled her with admiration and a sort of jealous envy for
Sidney, who could have none of these things.In a pathetic sort of way,
she mothered Christine in lieu of her own daughter.And it was her quick eye that discerned something wrong.Under her excitement was an undercurrent of reserve.Anna, rich in maternity if in nothing else, felt it, and in reply to
some speech of Christine's that struck her as hard, not quite fitting,
she gave her a gentle admonishing."Married life takes a little adjusting, my dear," she said."After we
have lived to ourselves for a number of years, it is not easy to live
for some one else."Christine straightened from the tea-table she was arranging.But why should the woman do all the adjusting?""Men are more set," said poor Anna, who had never been set in anything
in her life."It is harder for them to give in.And, of course, Palmer
is older, and his habits--"

"The less said about Palmer's habits the better," flashed Christine."I
appear to have married a bunch of habits."She gave over her unpacking, and sat down listlessly by the fire, while
Anna moved about, busy with the small activities that delighted her.Six weeks of Palmer's society in unlimited amounts had bored Christine
to distraction.She sat with folded hands and looked into a future that
seemed to include nothing but Palmer: Palmer asleep with his mouth open;
Palmer shaving before breakfast, and irritable until he had had his
coffee; Palmer yawning over the newspaper.And there was a darker side to the picture than that.There was a vision
of Palmer slipping quietly into his room and falling into the heavy
sleep, not of drunkenness perhaps, but of drink.She knew now that it would happen again and again, as long as he
lived.The letter she had received on
her wedding day was burned into her brain.There would be that in the
future too, probably.She was making a brave clutch
at happiness.But that afternoon of the first day at home she was
terrified.She was glad when Anna went and left her alone by her fire.But when she heard a step in the hall, she opened the door herself.She
had determined to meet Palmer with a smile.Tears brought nothing;
she had learned that already."Daughters of joy," they called girls like the one on the Avenue.She waited while, with his back to her, he
shook himself like a great dog.He smiled down at her, his kindly eyes lighting."It's good to be home and to see you again.Won't you come in to my
fire?""All the more reason why you should come," she cried gayly, and held the
door wide.The little parlor was cheerful with fire and soft lamps, bright with
silver vases full of flowers.K. stepped inside and took a critical
survey of the room."Between us we have made a pretty good job of this, I
with the paper and the wiring, and you with your pretty furnishings and
your pretty self."Christine saw his approval, and was
happier than she had been for weeks.She put on the thousand little airs
and graces that were a part of her--held her chin high, looked up at
him with the little appealing glances that she had found were wasted on
Palmer.She lighted the spirit-lamp to make tea, drew out the best chair
for him, and patted a cushion with her well-cared-for hands."And see, here's a footstool.""I am ridiculously fond of being babied," said K., and quite basked in
his new atmosphere of well-being.This was better than his empty room
upstairs, than tramping along country roads, than his own thoughts."Do
tell me all the scandal of the Street.""There has been no scandal since you went away," said K. And, because
each was glad not to be left to his own thoughts, they laughed at this
bit of unconscious humor."Seriously," said Le Moyne, "we have been very quiet.I have had my
salary raised and am now rejoicing in twenty-two dollars a week.Just when I had all my ideas fixed for
fifteen, I get twenty-two and have to reassemble them."It is very disagreeable when one's income becomes a burden," said
Christine gravely.She was finding in Le Moyne something that she needed just then--a
solidity, a sort of dependability, that had nothing to do with
heaviness.She felt that here was a man she could trust, almost confide
in.She liked his long hands, his shabby but well-cut clothes, his fine
profile with its strong chin.She left off her little affectations,--a
tribute to his own lack of them,--and sat back in her chair, watching
the fire.When K. chose, he could talk well.The Howes had been to Bermuda on
their wedding trip.He knew Bermuda; that gave them a common ground.As for K., he frankly enjoyed
the little visit--drew himself at last with regret out of his chair."You've been very nice to ask me in, Mrs."I hope you
will allow me to come again.But, of course, you are going to be very
gay."It seemed to Christine she would never be gay again.She did not
want him to go away.The sound of his deep voice gave her a sense of
security.She liked the clasp of the hand he held out to her, when at
last he made a move toward the door.Howe I am sorry he missed our little party," said Le Moyne.As he closed the door behind him, there was a new light in Christine's
eyes.Things were not right, but, after all, they were not hopeless.One
might still have friends, big and strong, steady of eye and voice.When
Palmer came home, the smile she gave him was not forced.The day's exertion had been bad for Anna.Le Moyne found her on the
couch in the transformed sewing-room, and gave her a quick glance of
apprehension.She was propped up high with pillows, with a bottle of
aromatic ammonia beside her."Just--short of breath," she panted.Sidney--is
coming home--to supper; and--the others--Palmer and--"

That was as far as she got.K., watch in hand, found her pulse thin,
stringy, irregular.He had been prepared for some such emergency, and he
hurried into his room for amyl-nitrate.When he came back she was almost
unconscious.He broke the capsule
in a towel, and held it over her face.After a time the spasm relaxed,
but her condition remained alarming.Harriet, who had come home by that time, sat by the couch and held her
sister's hand.Only once in the next hour or so did she speak.Harriet was too wretched to
notice the professional manner in which K. set to work over Anna."I've been a very hard sister to her," she said."If you can pull her
through, I'll try to make up for it."Christine sat on the stairs outside, frightened and helpless.They had
sent for Sidney; but the little house had no telephone, and the message
was slow in getting off.Ed came panting up the stairs and into the room."Well, this is sad, Harriet," said Dr."Why in the name of Heaven,
when I wasn't around, didn't you get another doctor.If she had had some
amyl-nitrate--"

"I gave her some nitrate of amyl," said K. quietly."There was really no
time to send for anybody.She almost went under at half-past five."Max had kept his word, and even Dr.He
gave a quick glance at this tall young man who spoke so quietly of what
he had done for the sick woman, and went on with his work.Sidney arrived a little after six, and from that moment the confusion in
the sick-room was at an end.She moved Christine from the stairs,
where Katie on her numerous errands must crawl over her; set Harriet to
warming her mother's bed and getting it ready; opened windows, brought
order and quiet.And then, with death in her eyes, she took up her
position beside her mother.This was no time for weeping; that would
come later.Once she turned to K., standing watchfully beside her."I think you have known this for a long time," she said.And, when he
did not answer: "Why did you let me stay away from her?It would have
been such a little time!""We were trying to do our best for both of you," he replied.It came as a cry from the depths of the
girl's new experience."She has had so little of life," she said, over and over."After all, Sidney," he said, "the Street IS life: the world is only
many streets.She had love and content, and she
had you."Anna died a little after midnight, a quiet passing, so that only Sidney
and the two men knew when she went away.During all that long evening she had sat looking back over years of
small unkindnesses.The thorn of Anna's inefficiency had always rankled
in her flesh.She had been hard, uncompromising, thwarted.Once he thought she was fainting, and
went to her.Do you think you could get them all out of the room and
let me have her alone for just a few minutes?"He cleared the room, and took up his vigil outside the door.And, as he
stood there, he thought of what he had said to Sidney about the Street.Here in this very house were death and
separation; Harriet's starved life; Christine and Palmer beginning a
long and doubtful future together; himself, a failure, and an impostor.When he opened the door again, Sidney was standing by her mother's bed.He went to her, and she turned and put her head against his shoulder
like a tired child."Take me away, K.," she said pitifully.And, with his arm around her, he led her out of the room.Outside of her small immediate circle Anna's death was hardly felt.Harriet carried back to her
business a heaviness of spirit that made it difficult to bear with
the small irritations of her day.Perhaps Anna's incapacity, which had
always annoyed her, had been physical.She must have had her trouble a
longtime.She remembered other women of the Street who had crept through
inefficient days, and had at last laid down their burdens and closed
their mild eyes, to the lasting astonishment of their families.What did
they think about, these women, as they pottered about?Did they resent
the impatience that met their lagging movements, the indifference
that would not see how they were failing?Hot tears fell on Harriet's
fashion-book as it lay on her knee.Not only for Anna--for Anna's
prototypes everywhere.On Sidney--and in less measure, of course, on K.--fell the real brunt of
the disaster.Sidney kept up well until after the funeral, but went down
the next day with a low fever.Ed said, and sternly forbade the hospital
again until Christmas.Morning and evening K. stopped at her door and
inquired for her, and morning and evening came Sidney's reply:--

"Much better.But the days dragged on and she did not get about.Downstairs, Christine and Palmer had entered on the round of midwinter
gayeties.Palmer's "crowd" was a lively one.There were dinners
and dances, week-end excursions to country-houses.The Street grew
accustomed to seeing automobiles stop before the little house at all
hours of the night.Johnny Rosenfeld, driving Palmer's car, took to
falling asleep at the wheel in broad daylight, and voiced his discontent
to his mother."You never know where you are with them guys," he said briefly."We
start out for half an hour's run in the evening, and get home with the
milk-wagons.And the more some of them have had to drink, the more they
want to drive the machine.If I get a chance, I'm going to beat it while
the wind's my way."But, talk as he might, in Johnny Rosenfeld's loyal heart there was no
thought of desertion.Palmer had given him a man's job, and he would
stick by it, no matter what came.There were some things that Johnny Rosenfeld did not tell his mother.There were evenings when the Howe car was filled, not with Christine
and her friends, but with women of a different world; evenings when the
destination was not a country estate, but a road-house; evenings when
Johnny Rosenfeld, ousted from the driver's seat by some drunken youth,
would hold tight to the swinging car and say such fragments of prayers
as he could remember.Johnny Rosenfeld, who had started life with few
illusions, was in danger of losing such as he had.One such night Christine put in, lying wakefully in her bed, while the
clock on the mantel tolled hour after hour into the night.Palmer did
not come home at all.He sent a note from the office in the morning:

"I hope you are not worried, darling.The car broke down near the
Country Club last night, and there was nothing to do but to spend the
night there.I would have sent you word, but I did not want to rouse
you.What do you say to the theater to-night and supper afterward?"She telephoned the Country Club that morning,
and found that Palmer had not been there.But, although she knew now
that he was deceiving her, as he always had deceived her, as probably
he always would, she hesitated to confront him with what she knew.She
shrank, as many a woman has shrunk before, from confronting him with his
lie.But the second time it happened, she was roused.It was almost Christmas
then, and Sidney was well on the way to recovery, thinner and very
white, but going slowly up and down the staircase on K.'s arm, and
sitting with Harriet and K. at the dinner table.She was begging to be
back on duty for Christmas, and K. felt that he would have to give her
up soon.At three o'clock one morning Sidney roused from a light sleep to hear a
rapping on her door.She carried a
candle, and before she spoke she looked at Sidney's watch on the bedside
table."I hoped my clock was wrong," she said."I am sorry to waken you,
Sidney, but I don't know what to do."Sidney had lighted the gas and was throwing on her dressing-gown."When he went out did he say--"

"He said nothing.Sidney, I am going home in the
morning.""You don't mean that, do you?""Don't I look as if I mean it?How much of this sort of thing is a woman
supposed to endure?"These things always seem terrible in the
middle of the night, but by morning--"

Christine whirled on her.You remember the letter I got on my wedding
day?""Believe it or not," said Christine doggedly, "that's exactly what has
happened.I got something out of that little rat of a Rosenfeld boy, and
the rest I know because I know Palmer.The hospital had taught Sidney one thing: that it took many people to
make a world, and that out of these some were inevitably vicious.But
vice had remained for her a clear abstraction.There were such people,
and because one was in the world for service one cared for them.Even
the Saviour had been kind to the woman of the streets.But here abruptly Sidney found the great injustice of the world--that
because of this vice the good suffer more than the wicked."It makes me hate all the men in the world.Palmer cares for you, and yet he can do a thing like this!"Christine was pacing nervously up and down the room.Mere companionship
had soothed her.She was now, on the surface at least, less excited than
Sidney."They are not all like Palmer, thank Heaven," she said.My father is one, and your K., here in the house, is
another."At four o'clock in the morning Palmer Howe came home.Christine met
him in the lower hall.She
confronted him in her straight white gown and waited for him to speak."I am sorry to be so late, Chris," he said."The fact is, I am all in.I
was driving the car out Seven Mile Run.We blew out a tire and the thing
turned over."Christine noticed then that his right arm was hanging inert by his side.CHAPTER XVI


Young Howe had been firmly resolved to give up all his bachelor habits
with his wedding day.In his indolent, rather selfish way, he was much
in love with his wife.But with the inevitable misunderstandings of the first months of
marriage had come a desire to be appreciated once again at his face
value.Grace had taken him, not for what he was, but for what he seemed
to be.She knew him now--all his small
indolences, his affectations, his weaknesses.Later on, like other
women since the world began, she would learn to dissemble, to affect to
believe him what he was not.And so, back to Grace six weeks after his wedding day came Palmer
Howe, not with a suggestion to renew the old relationship, but for
comradeship.Christine sulked--he wanted good cheer; Christine was intolerant--he
wanted tolerance; she disapproved of him and showed her disapproval--he
wanted approval.He wanted life to be comfortable and cheerful, without
recriminations, a little work and much play, a drink when one was
thirsty.Distorted though it was, and founded on a wrong basis, perhaps,
deep in his heart Palmer's only longing was for happiness; but this
happiness must be of an active sort--not content, which is passive, but
enjoyment.No taxi working its head
off for us.Just a little run over the country roads, eh?"It was the afternoon of the day before Christine's night visit to
Sidney.The office had been closed, owing to a death, and Palmer was in
possession of a holiday."We'll go out to the Climbing Rose and have
supper.""That's not true, Grace, and you know it."The roads are frozen hard; an hour's run
into the country will bring your color back."Go and ride with your wife," said the girl,
and flung away from him.The last few weeks had filled out her thin figure, but she still bore
traces of her illness.She
looked curiously boyish, almost sexless.Because she saw him wince when she mentioned Christine, her ill temper
increased."You get out of here," she said suddenly."I didn't ask you to come
back.You always knew I would have to marry some day."I didn't hear any reports of you hanging
around the hospital to learn how I was getting along."Besides, one of--" He hesitated over his wife's name."A
girl I know very well was in the training-school.There would have been
the devil to pay if I'd as much as called up.""You never told me you were going to get married."Cornered, he slipped an arm around her."I meant to tell you, honey; but you got sick.Anyhow, I--I hated to
tell you, honey."There was a comfortable feeling of
coming home about going there again.And, now that the worst minute of
their meeting was over, he was visibly happier.But Grace continued to
stand eyeing him somberly."I've got something to tell you," she said."Don't have a fit, and don't
laugh.If you do, I'll--I'll jump out of the window.I've got a place in
a store.She was a nice girl and he was fond of her.And he was not unselfish about it.He did not want her to belong to any one else."One of the nurses in the hospital, a Miss Page, has got me something to
do at Lipton and Homburg's.I am going on for the January white sale.If
I make good they will keep me."He had put her aside without a qualm; and now he met her announcement
with approval.They would have a holiday
together, and then they would say good-bye.He was getting off well, all things considered.But that isn't any
reason why we shouldn't be friends, is it?I would like to feel that I can stop in now and then and say how do you
do."The mention of Sidney's name brought up in his mind Christine as he had
left her that morning.She used to be a good sport,
but she had never been the same since the day of the wedding.He thought
her attitude toward him was one of suspicion.But any attempt on his part to fathom it only met with cold silence."I'll tell you what we'll do," he said."We won't go to any of the old
places.I've found a new roadhouse in the country that's respectable
enough to suit anybody.We'll go out to Schwitter's and get some dinner.And on the way out he lived up to the letter of
their agreement.The situation exhilarated him: Grace with her new air
of virtue, her new aloofness; his comfortable car; Johnny Rosenfeld's
discreet back and alert ears.The adventure had all the thrill of a new conquest in it.He treated the
girl with deference, did not insist when she refused a cigarette, felt
glowingly virtuous and exultant at the same time.When the car drew up before the Schwitter place, he slipped a
five-dollar bill into Johnny Rosenfeld's not over-clean hand."I don't mind the ears," he said.And
Johnny stalled his engine in sheer surprise."There's just enough of the Jew in me," said Johnny, "to know how to
talk a lot and say nothing, Mr.He crawled stiffly out of the car and prepared to crank it."I'll just give her the 'once over' now and then," he said."She'll
freeze solid if I let her stand."Grace had gone up the narrow path to the house.She had the gift of
looking well in her clothes, and her small hat with its long quill
and her motor-coat were chic and becoming.She never overdressed, as
Christine was inclined to do.Fortunately for Palmer, Tillie did not see him.A heavy German maid
waited at the table in the dining-room, while Tillie baked waffles in
the kitchen.Johnny Rosenfeld, going around the side path to the kitchen door with
visions of hot coffee and a country supper for his frozen stomach, saw
her through the window bending flushed over the stove, and hesitated.Then, without a word, he tiptoed back to the car again, and, crawling
into the tonneau, covered himself with rugs.In his untutored mind were
certain great qualities, and loyalty to his employer was one.The five
dollars in his pocket had nothing whatever to do with it.At eighteen he had developed a philosophy of four words.It took the
place of the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism.It
was: "Mind your own business."The discovery of Tillie's hiding-place interested but did not thrill
him.If she wanted to do the sort of thing she
was doing, that was her affair.Tillie and her middle-aged lover, Palmer
Howe and Grace--the alley was not unfamiliar with such relationships.It
viewed them with tolerance until they were found out, when it raised its
hands.True to his promise, Palmer wakened the sleeping boy before nine
o'clock.Grace had eaten little and drunk nothing; but Howe was slightly
stimulated."Give her the 'once over,'" he told Johnny, "and then go back and crawl
into the rugs again.Their progress was slow and rough over the
country roads, but when they reached the State road Howe threw open the
throttle.He took chances
and got away with them, laughing at the girl's gasps of dismay."Wait until I get beyond Simkinsville," he said, "and I'll let her out.The girl sat beside him with her eyes fixed ahead.He had been drinking,
and the warmth of the liquor was in his voice.She was going to make him live up to the letter of his promise to
go away at the house door; and more and more she realized that it would
be difficult.Instead of laughing when
she drew back from a proffered caress, he turned surly.Obstinate lines
that she remembered appeared from his nostrils to the corners of his
mouth.Finally she hit on a plan to make him stop somewhere in her neighborhood
and let her get out of the car.Now it passed them, and as
often they passed it.Palmer's car lost on
the hills, but gained on the long level stretches, which gleamed with a
coating of thin ice."I wish you'd let them get ahead, Palmer."I told you we'd travel to-night."What the deuce was the matter with
women, anyhow?Here was Grace as
sober as Christine.His light car skidded and struck the big car heavily.On a smooth road
perhaps nothing more serious than broken mudguards would have been the
result.But on the ice the small car slewed around and slid over the
edge of the bank.At the bottom of the declivity it turned over.Howe freed himself and stood
erect, with one arm hanging at his side.There was no sound at all from
the boy under the tonneau.Down the bank plunged a heavy, gorilla-like
figure, long arms pushing aside the frozen branches of trees.When he
reached the car, O'Hara found Grace sitting unhurt on the ground.In the
wreck of the car the lamps had not been extinguished, and by their light
he made out Howe, swaying dizzily.The other members of O'Hara's party had crawled down the bank by that
time.With the aid of a jack, they got the car up.Johnny Rosenfeld lay
doubled on his face underneath.When he came to and opened his eyes,
Grace almost shrieked with relief."I'm all right," said Johnny Rosenfeld.And, when they offered him
whiskey: "Away with the fire-water.I--I--" A spasm of
pain twisted his face.With his arms he lifted
himself to a sitting position, and fell back again.CHAPTER XVII


By Christmas Day Sidney was back in the hospital, a little wan, but
valiantly determined to keep her life to its mark of service.She had a
talk with K. the night before she left.Katie was out, and Sidney had put the dining-room in order.K. sat by
the table and watched her as she moved about the room.The past few weeks had been very wonderful to him: to help her up and
down the stairs, to read to her in the evenings as she lay on the couch
in the sewing-room; later, as she improved, to bring small dainties home
for her tray, and, having stood over Katie while she cooked them, to
bear them in triumph to that upper room--he had not been so happy in
years."I hope you don't feel as if you must stay on," she said anxiously."Not
that we don't want you--you know better than that.""There is no place else in the whole world that I want to go to," he
said simply."I seem to be always relying on somebody's kindness to--to keep things
together.First, for years and years, it was Aunt Harriet; now it is
you.""Don't you realize that, instead of your being grateful to me, it is
I who am undeniably grateful to you?I have lived
around--in different places and in different ways.I would rather be
here than anywhere else in the world."There was so much that was hopeless in his
eyes that he did not want her to see.She would be quite capable, he
told himself savagely, of marrying him out of sheer pity if she ever
guessed.And he was afraid--afraid, since he wanted her so much--that he
would be fool and weakling enough to take her even on those terms.Everything was ready for her return to the hospital.She had been out
that day to put flowers on the quiet grave where Anna lay with folded
hands; she had made her round of little visits on the Street; and now
her suit-case, packed, was in the hall."In one way, it will be a little better for you than if Christine and
Palmer were not in the house."She likes you, K. She depends on you, too, especially since that night
when you took care of Palmer's arm before we got Dr.I often think,
K., what a good doctor you would have been.You knew so well what to do
for mother."She still could not trust her voice about her mother."Palmer's arm is going to be quite straight.Ed is so proud of Max
over it.Once at least, whenever they were
together, she brought Max into the conversation.He is
interesting, don't you think?""Very," said K.

To save his life, he could not put any warmth into his voice.It was not in human nature to expect more of him."Those long talks you have, shut in your room--what in the world do you
talk about?She was a little jealous of those evenings, when she sat alone, or
when Harriet, sitting with her, made sketches under the lamp to the
accompaniment of a steady hum of masculine voices from across the hall.Max came in always, before he went,
and, leaning over the back of a chair, would inform her of the absolute
blankness of life in the hospital without her."I go every day because I must," he would assure her gayly; "but, I tell
you, the snap is gone out of it.When there was a chance that every cap
was YOUR cap, the mere progress along a corridor became thrilling."He
had a foreign trick of throwing out his hands, with a little shrug of
the shoulders.he said--which, being translated, means:
"What the devil's the use!"And K. would stand in the doorway, quietly smoking, or go back to his
room and lock away in his trunk the great German books on surgery with
which he and Max had been working out a case.So K. sat by the dining-room table and listened to her talk of Max that
last evening together.Rosenfeld to-day not to be too much discouraged about
Johnny.Now that you are
such friends,"--she eyed him wistfully,--"perhaps some day you will come
to one of his operations.Even if you didn't understand exactly, I know
it would thrill you.And--I'd like you to see me in my uniform, K. You
never have."She grew a little sad as the evening went on.She was going to miss K.
very much.While she was ill she had watched the clock for the time to
listen for him.She knew the way he slammed the front door.Palmer never
slammed the door.She knew too that, just after a bang that threatened
the very glass in the transom, K. would come to the foot of the stairs
and call:--

"Ahoy, there!""Aye, aye," she would answer--which was, he assured her, the proper
response.Whether he came up the stairs at once or took his way back to Katie had
depended on whether his tribute for the day was fruit or sweetbreads.He would miss her,
too; but he would have Harriet and Christine and--Max.Back in a circle
to Max, of course.She insisted, that last evening, on sitting up with him until midnight
ushered in Christmas Day.Christine and Palmer were out; Harriet, having
presented Sidney with a blouse that had been left over in the shop from
the autumn's business, had yawned herself to bed.When the bells announced midnight, Sidney roused with a start.She
realized that neither of them had spoken, and that K.The little clock on the shelf took up the burden of the
churches, and struck the hour in quick staccato notes.Sidney rose and went over to K., her black dress in soft folds about
her.Sidney left the little house at
six, with the street light still burning through a mist of falling snow.The hospital wards and corridors were still lighted when she went on
duty at seven o'clock.She had been assigned to the men's surgical ward,
and went there at once.She had not seen Carlotta Harrison since her
mother's death; but she found her on duty in the surgical ward.For the
second time in four months, the two girls were working side by side.Sidney's recollection of her previous service under Carlotta made her
nervous."We were all sorry to hear of your trouble," she said."I hope we shall
get on nicely."Sidney surveyed the ward, full to overflowing.At the far end two cots
had been placed."The ward is heavy, isn't it?"There are three of
us--you, myself, and a probationer."The first light of the Christmas morning was coming through the windows.Carlotta put out the lights and turned in a business-like way to her
records."The probationer's name is Wardwell," she said."Perhaps you'd better
help her with the breakfasts.If there's any way to make a mistake, she
makes it."It was after eight when Sidney found Johnny Rosenfeld.Suffering had refined the boy's features.His dark, heavily fringed eyes
looked at her from a pale face."I was in a private room; but it cost thirty plunks a week, so I moved.Sidney had not seen him since his accident.She had wished to go, but K.
had urged against it.She was not strong, and she had already suffered
much.And now the work of the ward pressed hard.She stood beside him and stroked his hand.He pretended to think that her sympathy was for his fall from the estate
of a private patient to the free ward."Oh, I'm all right, Miss Sidney," he said.Howe is paying six
dollars a week for me.The difference between me and the other fellows
around here is that I get a napkin on my tray and they don't.""Six dollars a week for a napkin is going some.I'm no bloated
aristocrat; I don't have to have a napkin.""Have they told you what the trouble is?"Max Wilson is going to
operate on me.What a thing it was
to be able to take this life-in-death of Johnny Rosenfeld's and make it
life again!All sorts of men made up Sidney's world: the derelicts who wandered
through the ward in flapping slippers, listlessly carrying trays; the
unshaven men in the beds, looking forward to another day of boredom, if
not of pain; Palmer Howe with his broken arm; K., tender and strong, but
filling no especial place in the world.Towering over them all was the
younger Wilson.He meant for her, that Christmas morning, all that the
other men were not--to their weakness strength, courage, daring, power.Johnny Rosenfeld lay back on the pillows and watched her face."When I was a kid," he said, "and ran along the Street, calling Dr.Max
a dude, I never thought I'd lie here watching that door to see him come
in.Ain't it the hell of a world, anyhow?It
ain't much of a Christmas to you, either."Sidney fed him his morning beef tea, and, because her eyes filled up
with tears now and then at his helplessness, she was not so skillful as
she might have been.When one spoonful had gone down his neck, he smiled
up at her whimsically.As much as was possible, the hospital rested on that Christmas Day.The
internes went about in fresh white ducks with sprays of mistletoe in
their buttonholes, doing few dressings.Over the upper floors, where the
kitchens were located, spread toward noon the insidious odor of roasting
turkeys.Every ward had its vase of holly.In the afternoon, services
were held in the chapel downstairs.Wheel-chairs made their slow progress along corridors and down
elevators.Convalescents who were able to walk flapped along in carpet
slippers.Outside the wide doors of the corridor
the wheel-chairs were arranged in a semicircle.Behind them, dressed for
the occasion, were the elevator-men, the orderlies, and Big John, who
drove the ambulance.On one side of the aisle, near the front, sat the nurses in rows, in
crisp caps and fresh uniforms.On the other side had been reserved a
place for the staff.The internes stood back against the wall, ready to
run out between rejoicings, as it were--for a cigarette or an ambulance
call, as the case might be.Over everything brooded the after-dinner peace of Christmas afternoon.The nurses sang, and Sidney sang with them, her fresh young voice rising
above the rest.Yellow winter sunlight came through the stained-glass
windows and shone on her lovely flushed face, her smooth kerchief, her
cap, always just a little awry.Max, lounging against the wall, across the chapel, found his eyes
straying toward her constantly.What
a zest for living and for happiness she had!The Episcopal clergyman read the Epistle:

"Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."She was good, and she had been anointed with the oil of
gladness.And he--

His brother was singing.His deep bass voice, not always true, boomed
out above the sound of the small organ.Ed had been a good brother to
him; he had been a good son.Max's vagrant mind wandered away from the service to the picture of his
mother over his brother's littered desk, to the Street, to K., to the
girl who had refused to marry him because she did not trust him, to
Carlotta last of all.He turned a little and ran his eyes along the line
of nurses.As if she were conscious of his scrutiny, she lifted
her head and glanced toward him.The nurses sang:--

     "O holy Child of Bethlehem!Descend to us, we pray;
      Cast out our sin, and enter in,
      Be born in us to-day."The wheel-chairs and convalescents quavered the familiar words.Ed's
heavy throat shook with earnestness.The Head, sitting a little apart with her hands folded in her lap and
weary with the suffering of the world, closed her eyes and listened.The Christmas morning had brought Sidney half a dozen gifts.K. sent her
a silver thermometer case with her monogram, Christine a toilet mirror.But the gift of gifts, over which Sidney's eyes had glowed, was a
great box of roses marked in Dr.Max's copper-plate writing, "From a
neighbor."Tucked in the soft folds of her kerchief was one of the roses that
afternoon.Max was waiting for Sidney in the
corridor.--she glanced down to the rose
she wore."The others make the most splendid bit of color in the ward.""They are not any the less mine because I am letting other people have a
chance to enjoy them."Under all his gayety he was curiously diffident with her.All the pretty
speeches he would have made to Carlotta under the circumstances died
before her frank glance.There were many things he wanted to say to her.He wanted to tell her
that he was sorry her mother had died; that the Street was empty without
her; that he looked forward to these daily meetings with her as a holy
man to his hour before his saint.What he really said was to inquire
politely whether she had had her Christmas dinner.Sidney eyed him, half amused, half hurt.Is it bad for discipline for us to be good
friends?"Something in her eyes roused
the devil of mischief that always slumbered in him."My car's been stalled in a snowdrift downtown since early this morning,
and I have Ed's Peggy in a sleigh.Put on your things and come for a
ride."He hoped Carlotta could hear what he said; to be certain of it, he
maliciously raised his voice a trifle.She was to be free that afternoon until six o'clock;
but she had promised to go home.Ten to one, he's with her now."The
heavy odor of the hospital, mingled with the scent of pine and evergreen
in the chapel; made her dizzy.And,
besides, if K. were with Christine--

"It's forbidden, isn't it?""And yet, you continue to tempt me and expect me to yield!""One of the most delightful things about temptation is yielding now and
then."Here was her old friend and
neighbor asking to take her out for a daylight ride.The swift rebellion
of youth against authority surged up in Sidney.Carlotta had gone by that time--gone with hate in her heart and black
despair.She knew very well what the issue would be.Sidney would drive
with him, and he would tell her how lovely she looked with the air on
her face and the snow about her.The jerky motion of the little sleigh
would throw them close together.He would
touch Sidney's hand daringly and smile in her eyes.That was his method:
to play at love-making like an audacious boy, until quite suddenly the
cloak dropped and the danger was there.The Christmas excitement had not died out in the ward when Carlotta went
back to it.On each bedside table was an orange, and beside it a pair
of woolen gloves and a folded white handkerchief.There were sprays of
holly scattered about, too, and the after-dinner content of roast turkey
and ice-cream.The lame girl who played the violin limped down the corridor into the
ward.She was greeted with silence, that truest tribute, and with the
instant composing of the restless ward to peace.She was pretty in a young, pathetic way, and because to her Christmas
was a festival and meant hope and the promise of the young Lord, she
played cheerful things.The ward sat up, remembered that it was not the Sabbath, smiled across
from bed to bed.The probationer, whose name was Wardwell, was a tall, lean girl with a
long, pointed nose.She kept up a running accompaniment of small talk to
the music."Last Christmas," she said plaintively, "we went out into the country
in a hay-wagon and had a real time.I don't know what I am here for,
anyhow."Turkey and goose, mince pie and pumpkin pie, four kinds of cake; that's
the sort of spread we have up in our part of the world.When I think of
what I sat down to to-day--!"She had a profound respect for Carlotta, and her motto in the hospital
differed from Sidney's in that it was to placate her superiors, while
Sidney's had been to care for her patients.Seeing Carlotta bored, she ventured a little gossip.She had idly
glued the label of a medicine bottle on the back of her hand, and was
scratching a skull and cross-bones on it."I wonder if you have noticed something," she said, eyes on the label."I have noticed that the three-o'clock medicines are not given," said
Carlotta sharply; and Miss Wardwell, still labeled and adorned, made the
rounds of the ward."I'm no gossip," she said, putting the tray on the table."If you won't
see, you won't.As it was not required that tears be recorded on the record, Carlotta
paid no attention to this.Miss Wardwell swelled with importance
and let her superior ask her twice.A hand seemed to catch Carlotta's heart and hold it.Being an old friend doesn't make you look at a girl as if you
wanted to take a bite out of her.Mark my word, Miss Harrison, she'll
never finish her training; she'll marry him.I wish," concluded the
probationer plaintively, "that some good-looking fellow like that would
take a fancy to me.I am as ugly as a mud fence, but
I've got style."She was long and sinuous, but she wore her
lanky, ill-fitting clothes with a certain distinction.Harriet Kennedy
would have dressed her in jade green to match her eyes, and with long
jade earrings, and made her a fashion.The violinist had seen the tears on Johnny
Rosenfeld's white cheeks, and had rushed into rollicking, joyous music."I'm twenty-one and she's eighteen," hummed the
ward under its breath."Lord, how I'd like to dance!If I ever get out of this charnel-house!"The medicine-tray lay at Carlotta's elbow; beside it the box of labels.Carlotta knew it down to the depths of
her tortured brain.As inevitably as the night followed the day, she was
losing her game.She had lost already, unless--

If she could get Sidney out of the hospital, it would simplify things.She surmised shrewdly that on the Street their interests were wide
apart.It was here that they met on common ground.The lame violin-player limped out of the ward; the shadows of the
early winter twilight settled down.At five o'clock Carlotta sent Miss
Wardwell to first supper, to the surprise of that seldom surprised
person.The ward lay still or shuffled abut quietly.Christmas was over,
and there were no evening papers to look forward to.Carlotta gave the five-o'clock medicines.Then she sat down at the table
near the door, with the tray in front of her.There are certain thoughts
that are at first functions of the brain; after a long time the spinal
cord takes them up and converts them into acts almost automatically.Perhaps because for the last month she had done the thing so often in
her mind, its actual performance was almost without conscious thought.Carlotta took a bottle from her medicine cupboard, and, writing a new
label for it, pasted it over the old one.Then she exchanged it for one
of the same size on the medicine tray.In the dining-room, at the probationers' table, Miss Wardwell was
talking."Believe me," she said, "me for the country and the simple life after
this.They think I'm only a probationer and don't see anything, but I've
got eyes in my head.Wilson, and she
thinks I don't see it.But never mind; I paid, her up to-day for a few
of the jolts she has given me."Throughout the dining-room busy and competent young women came and ate,
hastily or leisurely as their opportunity was, and went on their way
again.In their hands they held the keys, not always of life and death
perhaps, but of ease from pain, of tenderness, of smooth pillows, and
cups of water to thirsty lips.In their eyes, as in Sidney's, burned the
light of service.But here and there one found women, like Carlotta and Miss Wardwell,
who had mistaken their vocation, who railed against the monotony of the
life, its limitations, its endless sacrifices.Fifty or so against two--fifty who looked out on the world with the
fearless glance of those who have seen life to its depths, and, with the
broad understanding of actual contact, still found it good.Fifty who
were learning or had learned not to draw aside their clean starched
skirts from the drab of the streets.And the fifty, who found the very
scum of the gutters not too filthy for tenderness and care, let Carlotta
and, in lesser measure, the new probationer alone.They could not have
voiced their reasons.The supper-room was filled with their soft voices, the rustle of their
skirts, the gleam of their stiff white caps.When Carlotta came in, she greeted none of them.They did not like her,
and she knew it.Before her, instead of the tidy supper-table, she was seeing the
medicine-tray as she had left it."I guess I've fixed her," she said to herself.Her very soul was sick with fear of what she had done.CHAPTER XVIII


K. saw Sidney for only a moment on Christmas Day.This was when the gay
little sleigh had stopped in front of the house.Sidney had hurried radiantly in for a moment.Christine's parlor was
gay with firelight and noisy with chatter and with the clatter of her
tea-cups.K., lounging indolently in front of the fire, had turned to see Sidney
in the doorway, and leaped to his feet."I can't come in," she cried.I am out
sleigh-riding with Dr."Ask him in for a cup of tea," Christine called out."Here's Aunt
Harriet and mother and even Palmer!"Christine had aged during the last weeks, but she was putting up a brave
front.Sidney ran to the front door and called: "Will you come in for a cup of
tea?"As Sidney turned back into the house, she met Palmer.He had come out
in the hall, and had closed the door into the parlor behind him.His arm
was still in splints, and swung suspended in a gay silk sling.The sound of laughter came through the door faintly.The boy's face was
always with him."Better in some ways, but of course--"

"When are they going to operate?""He doesn't seem to blame you; he says it's all in the game.""Sidney, does Christine know that I was not alone that night?""If she guesses, it is not because of anything the boy has said.Out of the firelight, away from the chatter and the laughter, Palmer's
face showed worn and haggard.He put his free hand on Sidney's shoulder."I was thinking that perhaps if I went away--"

"That would be cowardly, wouldn't it?""If Christine would only say something and get it over with!She doesn't
sulk; I think she's really trying to be kind.She turns pale every time I touch her hand."All the light had died out of Sidney's face.Life was terrible, after
all--overwhelming.One did wrong things, and other people suffered; or
one was good, as her mother had been, and was left lonely, a widow, or
like Aunt Harriet.Things were so different from
what they seemed to be: Christine beyond the door, pouring tea and
laughing with her heart in ashes; Palmer beside her, faultlessly dressed
and wretched.The only one she thought really contented was K. He seemed
to move so calmly in his little orbit.He was always so steady, so
balanced.If life held no heights for him, at least it held no depths."There's only one thing, Palmer," she said gravely."Johnny Rosenfeld
is going to have his chance.If anybody in the world can save him, Max
Wilson can."The light of that speech was in her eyes when she went out to the sleigh
again.K. followed her out and tucked the robes in carefully about her.Is there any chance of having you home for supper?"I am to go on duty at six again."He waved them
off smilingly from the pavement, and went rather heavily back into the
house."Just how many men are in love with you, Sidney?"asked Max, as Peggy
started up the Street."No one that I know of, unless--"

"Exactly.Unless--"

"What I meant," she said with dignity, "is that unless one counts very
young men, and that isn't really love.""We'll leave out Joe Drummond and myself--for, of course, I am very
young.Who is in love with you besides Le Moyne?Any of the internes at
the hospital?"Le Moyne is not in love with me."There was such sincerity in her voice that Wilson was relieved.K., older than himself and more grave, had always had an odd attraction
for women.He had been frankly bored by them, but the fact had remained.And Max more than suspected that now, at last, he had been caught."Don't you really mean that you are in love with Le Moyne?"I am not in love with anybody; I haven't time
to be in love.So warm did the argument become that
they passed without seeing a middle-aged gentleman, short and rather
heavy set, struggling through a snowdrift on foot, and carrying in his
hand a dilapidated leather bag.But the cutter slipped by and left him knee-deep,
looking ruefully after them.Ed's mind, only a vague and
inarticulate regret.These things that came so easily to Max, the
affection of women, gay little irresponsibilities like the stealing
of Peggy and the sleigh, had never been his.If there was any faint
resentment, it was at himself.He had raised the boy wrong--he had
taught him to be selfish.Holding the bag high out of the drifts, he
made his slow progress up the Street.At something after two o'clock that night, K. put down his pipe
and listened.He had not been able to sleep since midnight.In his
dressing-gown he had sat by the small fire, thinking.The content of his
first few months on the Street was rapidly giving way to unrest.He
who had meant to cut himself off from life found himself again in close
touch with it; his eddy was deep with it.For the first time, he had begun to question the wisdom of what he had
done.It had taken courage, God knew,
to give up everything and come away.In a way, it would have taken more
courage to have stayed.He had thought, at first, that he could
fight down this love for Sidney.The
innocent touch of her hand on his arm, the moment when he had held her
in his arms after her mother's death, the thousand small contacts of her
returns to the little house--all these set his blood on fire.Under his quiet exterior K. fought many conflicts those winter
days--over his desk and ledger at the office, in his room alone,
with Harriet planning fresh triumphs beyond the partition, even by
Christine's fire, with Christine just across, sitting in silence and
watching his grave profile and steady eyes.He had a little picture of Sidney--a snap-shot that he had taken
himself.It showed Sidney minus a hand, which had been out of range when
the camera had been snapped, and standing on a steep declivity
which would have been quite a level had he held the camera straight.Nevertheless it was Sidney, her hair blowing about her, eyes looking
out, tender lips smiling.When she was not at home, it sat on K.'s
dresser, propped against his collar-box.When she was in the house, it
lay under the pin-cushion.Two o'clock in the morning, then, and K. in his dressing-gown, with the
picture propped, not against the collar-box, but against his lamp, where
he could see it.He sat forward in his chair, his hands folded around his knee, and
looked at it.He was trying to picture the Sidney of the photograph
in his old life--trying to find a place for her.There had been few women in his old life.There had been women who had cared for him, but he put them
impatiently out of his mind.Almost
before he had heaved his long legs out of the chair, she was tapping at
his door outside.Rosenfeld was standing in the lower hall,
a shawl about her shoulders."I've had word to go to the hospital," she said."I thought maybe you'd
go with me.It seems as if I can't stand it alone."Are you afraid to stay in the house alone?"He ran up the staircase to his room and flung on some clothing.Rosenfeld's sobs had become low moans; Christine stood
helplessly over her."I am terribly sorry," she said--"terribly sorry!When I think whose
fault all this is!"Rosenfeld put out a work-hardened hand and caught Christine's
fingers.I guess you and I
understand each other.K. never forgot the scene in the small emergency ward to which Johnny
had been taken.Under the white lights his boyish figure looked
strangely long.There was a group around the bed--Max Wilson, two or
three internes, the night nurse on duty, and the Head.Sitting just inside the door on a straight chair was Sidney--such a
Sidney as he never had seen before, her face colorless, her eyes wide
and unseeing, her hands clenched in her lap.When he stood beside her,
she did not move or look up.The group around the bed had parted to
admit Mrs.Only Sidney and K. remained by
the door, isolated, alone."You must not take it like that, dear.But, after
all, in that condition--"

It was her first knowledge that he was there.Her voice was dreary, inflectionless."They say I gave him the wrong medicine; that he's dying; that I
murdered him."I came on duty at six o'clock and gave the
medicines.When the night nurse came on at seven, everything was all
right.The medicine-tray was just as it should be.I
went to say good-night to him and he--he was asleep.I didn't give him
anything but what was on the tray," she finished piteously."I looked at
the label; I always look."By a shifting of the group around the bed, K.'s eyes looked for a moment
directly into Carlotta's.Just for a moment; then the crowd closed up
again.It was well for Carlotta that it did.She looked as if she had
seen a ghost--closed her eyes, even reeled."Get some one to
take her place."After all, the presence of this man in this room
at such a time meant nothing.He was Sidney's friend, that was all.It was the boy's weakened condition that was turning her
revenge into tragedy."I am all right," she pleaded across the bed to the Head.He had done everything he knew without
result.The boy, rousing for an instant, would lapse again into stupor.With a healthy man they could have tried more vigorous measures--could
have forced him to his feet and walked him about, could have beaten him
with knotted towels dipped in ice-water.But the wrecked body on the bed
could stand no such heroic treatment.It was Le Moyne, after all, who saved Johnny Rosenfeld's life.For, when
staff and nurses had exhausted all their resources, he stepped forward
with a quiet word that brought the internes to their feet astonished.There was a new treatment for such cases--it had been tried abroad."Try it, for Heaven's sake," he said.The apparatus was not in the house--must be extemporized, indeed, at
last, of odds and ends from the operating-room.K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?Mary travelled to the garden.She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now, with the tree shadows playing over
her.Now it was another and older man, daring,
intelligent, unscrupulous.And this time he had lost her absolutely,
lost her without a struggle to keep her.His only struggle had been with
himself, to remember that he had nothing to offer but failure."Do you know," said Sidney suddenly, "that it is almost a year since
that night you came up the Street, and I was here on the steps?""That's a fact, isn't it!"He managed to get some surprise into his
voice."Because--well, you know, K. Why do men always hate a woman who just
happens not to love them?"It would be much better for them if they
could.As a matter of fact, there are poor devils who go through life
trying to do that very thing, and failing."Sidney's eyes were on the tall house across.Ed's evening
office hour, and through the open window she could see a line of people
waiting their turn.They sat immobile, inert, doggedly patient, until
the opening of the back office door promoted them all one chair toward
the consulting-room."I shall be just across the Street," she said at last."Nearer than I am
at the hospital.""But we will still be friends, K.?"But, after another silence, he astounded her.She had fallen into the
way of thinking of him as always belonging to the house, even, in a
sense, belonging to her.And now--

"Shall you mind very much if I tell you that I am thinking of going
away?""My dear child, you do not need a roomer here any more.I have always
received infinitely more than I have paid for, even in the small
services I have been able to render.You are away, and some day you are going to be married.Don't you see--I
am not needed?""That does not mean you are not wanted."I'll always be near enough, so that I can see
you"--he changed this hastily--"so that we can still meet and talk
things over.Old friends ought to be like that, not too near, but to be
turned on when needed, like a tap.""The Rosenfelds are rather in straits.I thought of helping them to get
a small house somewhere and of taking a room with them.If they could furnish it even plainly, it could be
done."Have you always gone
through life helping people, K.?She bent over and put her hand on his shoulder."It will not be home without you, K."To save him, he could not have spoken just then.A riot of rebellion
surged up in him, that he must let this best thing in his life go out
of it.To go empty of heart through the rest of his days, while his very
arms ached to hold her!And she was so near--just above, with her hand
on his shoulder, her wistful face so close that, without moving, he
could have brushed her hair."You have not wished me happiness, K. Do you remember, when I was going
to the hospital and you gave me the little watch--do you remember what
you said?"You are going to leave us, and I--say it, K.""Good-bye, dear, and--God bless you."CHAPTER XXIII


The announcement of Sidney's engagement was not to be made for a year.Wilson, chafing under the delay, was obliged to admit to himself that
it was best.Carlotta would have
finished her training, and by that time would probably be reconciled to
the ending of their relationship.He had meant every word of what he had sworn to
Sidney.He was genuinely in love, even unselfishly--as far as he could
be unselfish.The secret was to be carefully kept also for Sidney's
sake.The hospital did not approve of engagements between nurses and the
staff.It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.The plants made
about the same growth on the two plats and suffered equally from bugs; but
when it came to digging, those from new seed yielded two bushels of large
potatoes for every one that could be secured on the land planted with seed
of our own growing.This difference in yield could be accounted for on no
other theory than the change in seed, as the quality of seed, soil, and
culture were the same.This leads to the belief that simply procuring seed
of favorite varieties from a distance would insure us good crops at much
less expense than can be done experimenting with new, high-priced seeds.In another column a Kansas correspondent speaks of the crab grass in an
exceedingly favorable way.We find the following regarding this grass in a
late New York Times: Every Northern farmer knows the common coarse grass
called door-yard grass, which has long, broad leaves, a tough, bunchy
root, and a three-fingered spreading head, which contains large, round
seeds.It is known as Eleusine Indica, and grows luxuriously in open
drains and moist places.This is an
extremely valuable grass in the South.A friend who went to Georgia soon
after the war bought an abandoned plantation on account of the grass
growing upon it.He pastured sheep upon it
and cut some for hay.Northern baled hay was selling at $30 a ton at that
time.He wrote asking me to buy him two mowers and a baling press, and
went to baling hay for the Southern market, selling his sheep and living
an easy life except in haying time.His three hundred acres of cleared
land has produced an average of 200 tons of hay every year which gives him
about four times as much profit as an acre of cotton would do.Perhaps
there may come an end to this business, and the grass will run out for
want of fresh seed, but with a yearly dressing of Charleston phosphate the
grass has kept up its original vigor.Now why could we not make some use
of this grass, and of others, such as quack-grass, which defy so
persistently all our efforts to destroy them?[Illustration: Entomological]


Insects in Illinois.Forbes, State Entomologist, makes the following report to the State
Board of Agriculture:

"Now that our year's entomological campaign is completed, a brief review
of some of its most important features and results will doubtless be of
interest.Early attention was given to the insects attacking corn in the
ground, before the sprout has appeared above the surface.A surprising
number were found to infest it at this period, the results of their
injuries being usually attributed by farmers to the weather, defective
seed, etc.Among these the seed corn maggot (Anthomyia zeae) was frequently
noted, and was received from many parts of the State.A small,
black-headed maggot, the larva of a very abundant, gnat-like fly (Seiara),
was excessively common in ground which had been previously in grass, and
attacked the seed corn if it did not germinate promptly and vigorously,
but apparently did not injure perfectly sound and healthy grains.A minute
yellow ant (Solenopsis fugax) was seen actually gnawing and licking away
the substance of the sound kernels in the ground, both before and after
they had sprouted.The corn plant-louse (Aphis maidis) was an early and
destructive enemy of the crop, often throttling the young shoot before it
had broken ground.It was chiefly confined to fields which had been just
previously in corn or grass."The chinch-bug was found in spring depositing the eggs for its first
brood of young about the roots of the corn, a habit not hitherto reported."With the increasing attention to the culture of sorghum, its insect
enemies are coming rapidly to the front.Four species of plant-lice, two
of them new, made a vigorous attack upon this crop in the vicinity of
Champaign, and two of them were likewise abundant in broom-corn."The corn root-worm (Diabrotica longicornis) was occasionally met with in
sorghum, but does not seem likely to do any great mischief to that plant.It could not be found in broom-corn.In fields of maize, however, it was
again very destructive, where corn had been raised on the same ground a
year or two before.The Hessian Fly did great damage throughout the winter
wheat region of the State, many fields not being worth harvesting in
consequence of its ravages.Several facts were collected tending to show
that it is three brooded in the southern part of the State.Nearly or
quite all the last brood passed the summer as "flax seeds" in the stubble,
where they might easily have been destroyed by general and concerted
action.Fortunately, the summer weather was unfavorable to their
development; and the drouth conspired with their parasites to greatly
diminish their numbers.In the regions under our observation, not one in a
thousand emerged from the midsummer pupa-cases, and numbers of the larvae
were found completely dried up."The wheat straw-worm (Isosoma tritici), a minute, slender, yellow grub,
which burrows inside the growing stem, dwarfing or blighting the forming
head, was abundant throughout the winter wheat region of Southern
Illinois, causing, in some places, a loss scarcely exceeded by that due to
the Hessian Fly.Our breeding experiments demonstrate that this insect
winters in the straw as larvae or pupa, emerging as an adult fly early in
spring, these flies laying their eggs upon the stems after they commence
to joint.As the flies are very minute, and nearly all are wingless, their
spread from field to field is slow, and it seems entirely within the power
of the individual farmer to control this insect by burning or otherwise
destroying the stubble in summer or autumn, and burning the surplus of the
straw not fed to stock early in spring.A simple rotation of crops,
devoting land previously in wheat to some other grain or to grass, will
answer instead of burning the stubble."The life history of the wheat bulb-worm (Meromyza Americana) was
completed this year.The second or summer brood did decided injury to
wheat in Fulton county, so many of the heads being killed that some of the
fields looked gray at a little distance.This species was also injurious
to rye, but much less so than to wheat.It certainly does not attack oats
at all; fields of that grain raised where winter wheat had been destroyed
by it, and plowed up, being entirely free from it, while wheat fields
adjacent were badly damaged.We have good evidence that postponement of
sowing to as late a date as possible prevents the ravages of this insect,
in the same way as it does those of the Hessian Fly."The common rose chafer (Macrodactylus subspinosus) greatly injured some
fields of corn in Will county, the adult beetle devouring the leaves."The 'flea <DW64>-bug' (Thyreocoris pulicarius) was found injurious to
wheat in Montgomery county, draining the sap from the heads before
maturity, so that the kernel shriveled and ripened prematurely.In parts
of some fields the crop was thus almost wholly destroyed."The entomological record of the orchard and the fruit garden is not less
eventful than that of the farm.In extreme Southern Illinois, the forest
tent caterpillar (Clislocampa sylvatica) made a frightful inroad upon the
apple orchard, absolutely defoliating every tree in large districts.It
also did great mischief to many forest trees.Its injuries to fruit might
have been almost wholly prevented, either by destroying the eggs upon the
twigs of the trees in autumn, as was successfully done by many, or by
spraying the foliage of infested trees in spring with Paris green, or
similar poison, as was done with the best effect and at but slight expense
by Mr.Great numbers of these caterpillars
were killed by a contagious disease, which swept them off just as they
were ready to transform to the chrysalis; but vast quantities of the eggs
are now upon the trees, ready to hatch in spring."A large apple orchard in Hancock county dropped a great part of its crop
on account of injuries done to the fruit by the plum curculio
(Conotrachelus nenuphar).There is little question that these insects were
forced to scatter through the apple orchard by the destruction, the
previous autumn, of an old peach orchard which had been badly infested by
them."In Southern strawberry fields, very serious loss was occasioned by the
tarnished plant-bug (Lygus lineolaris), which I have demonstrated to be at
least a part of the cause of the damage known as the 'buttoning' of the
berry.The dusky plant-bug (Deraecoris rapidus) worked upon the
strawberries in precisely the same manner and at the same time, in some
fields being scarcely less abundant than the other.I have found that both
these species may be promptly and cheaply killed by pyrethrum, either
diluted with flour or suspended in water, and also by an emulsion of
kerosene, so diluted with water that the mixture shall contain about 3 per
cent of kerosene."The so-called'strawberry root-worm' of Southern Illinois proves to be
not one species merely, but three--the larvae of Colaspsis brunnae, Paria
aterrima and Scelodonta pubescens.The periods and life histories of these
three species are curiously different, so that they succeed each other in
their attacks upon the strawberry roots, instead of competing for food at
the same time.The three together infest the plant during nearly the whole
growing season--Colaspsis first, Paria next, and Scelodonta last.The
beetles all feed upon the leaves in July and August, and may then be
poisoned with Paris green."The season has been specially characterized by the occurrence of several
widespread and destructive contagious diseases among insects.Elaborate
studies of these have demonstrated that they are due to bacteria and other
parasitic fungi, that these disease germs may be artificially cultivated
outside the bodies of the insects, and that when sown or sprinkled upon
the food of healthy individuals, the disease follows as a consequence.We
have in this the beginning of a new method of combating insect injuries
which promises some useful results."The elegant equipment of coaches and sleepers being added to its various
through routes is gaining it many friends.Sandra went to the kitchen.Its perfect track of steel, and solid road-bed, are a guarantee against

[Illustration: LIVE STOCK DEPARTMENT]

Stockmen, Write for Your Paper.Well-informed live stock men estimate the drive from Texas the coming
spring at 325,000 head, unless shipping rates are unusually favorable,
when it may go above 400,000 head.A careful estimate of the stock on the range near the Black Hills is as
follows: Cattle, 383,900 head; horses, 2,200; sheep, 8,700.It is asserted
that the stock has wintered remarkably well, the loss not exceeding 1-1/2
per cent.A virulent disease resembling blind staggers has appeared among the horses
of Oregon, and a large number of valuable animals have succumbed to it.So far the veterinarians have been
unable to stay its progress.The period of gestation in the mare is in general forty-eight weeks; the
cow forty six weeks; the ewe twenty-one weeks, and the sow sixteen weeks.Having the date of service, the date at which birth is due may be easily
ascertained.Careful breeders always keep strict record of each animal.The Illinois State Board of Agriculture has adopted a rule requiring the
slaughter of all sweepstakes animals at the next Fat Stock Show, in order
that the judgment of the committees may be verified as to the quality of
the animals.The premiums for dressed carcasses have been largely
increased over last year.The subject of our 1st page illustration, Black Prince, is a
representative of that black, hornless race, which had its foundation in
Scotland several hundred years ago, known as Polled Aberdeen-Angus Cattle.This breed of cattle has grown into very high favor in America during the
last five or six years; so much so, that, while in 1879 the number of
representatives of this race in America were very few, now the demand for
them is so great that the number imported yearly is easily disposed of at
prices ranging from $250 to $2,000.Geary Bros., London, Ont., say
that the demand for such cattle during the past winter has never been
equaled in their long experience.As the prevalence of the foot-and-mouth
disease in Great Britain, will, without a doubt cause the importation of
cattle from that country to be prohibited at an early day, it is safe to
say that the value of such stock must rise, as the number of its
representatives in America is limited, and those who have such stock in
their possession fully appreciate their value; and not being under the
necessity of selling, will hold their Aberdeen-Angus cattle unless enticed
by a very high price.Therefore, the coming public sale of Aberdeen-Angus
cattle in Chicago may be looked forward to as going to show unequaled
average prices and especially of individual prize animals.Geary Bros., London, Ont., in Scotland,
and brought to America last year.In him are to be found all the fine
characteristics of his race.He took the second place at the Smithfield
Fat Stock Show of 1883; at the Kansas Fat Stock Show of the same year he
was placed second to the Short-horn steer Starlight; and at the last Fat
Stock Show of Chicago he took first place among the best three-year-olds
of the country.At the time of entry for the Chicago Show he was 1,380
days old, and his weight 2,330 pounds, almost 175 pounds less than he
weighed before leaving Scotland for this country.Besides the prizes above
mentioned, Black Prince won numerous honors in his own country before
coming here.Their black, glossy, thick coats, their hornless heads, and particularly
their low-set, smooth, round and lengthy bodies are the principal features
of this breed.Beef consumers will find them in the front rank for yielding wholesome,
nourishing food, juicy, tender, and of the best flavor, free from all
unpalatable masses of fat or tallow.It is these favorable characteristics
which have gained such an excellent, and widespread reputation for the
Aberdeen-Angus cattle.The growing belief that the best breed of beeves is
the one that for a given quantity of food, and in the shortest time will
produce the greatest weight of nutritious food combined with the smallest
amount of bone, tallow, and other waste is going to make these cattle as
popular with our beef consumers and producers generally as they have been
with those who have long been familiar with their many superior qualities.With plenty of milk and mill-feed to mix with the corn, good hogs may be
grown without grass.But with corn alone, the task of growing and
fattening a hog without grass costs more than the hog is worth.To make hog-growing profitable to the farmer, he must have grass.In the
older States where the tame grasses are plenty, it is a very thoughtless
farmer who has not his hog pasture.But out here in Kansas and Nebraska,
where we have plenty of corn, but no grass, except the wild varieties, the
most enterprising of us are at our wits' ends.Hogs will eat these wild
grasses while tender in the spring, and, even without corn, will grow
long, tall, and wonderfully lean, and in the fall will fatten much more
readily than hogs grown on corn.But fattening the lean hogs takes too
much corn.We must have a grass that the hogs will relish, and on which
they will both grow and fatten.They will do this on clover, orchard
grass, bluegrass, and other tame grasses.But we have not got any of
these, nor do we know how to get them.Hundreds of bushels of tame grass
seeds are sold every spring by our implement dealers.A few have succeeded
in getting some grass, but nine out of ten lose their seed.We either do
not know how to grow it, or the seed is not good, or the soil is too new.The truth, perhaps, lies a little in all three.Our agricultural colleges
are claiming to have success with these grasses, and their experience
would be of value to the farmers if these reports could ever reach them.Not one farmer in a hundred ever sees them.I know of but one farmer of
sufficient political influence to receive these reports through the mails.The rest of us can get them for the asking.But not many of us know this,
fewer know whom to ask, and still fewer ask.I do not know a farmer that
orders a single copy.Farmers, living about our county towns, and doing
their trading there, and having leisure enough to loaf about the public
offices, and curiosity enough to scratch through the dust-covered piles of
old papers and rubbish in the corner, are usually rewarded by finding a
copy of these valuable reports.But we, who live far away from the county
seat, do our farming without this aid, and mostly without any knowledge of
their existence.This looks like a lamentable state of agricultural
stupidity.Notwithstanding this dark picture we would all read, and be
greatly profited by these reports, if they were laid on our tables.If it pays to expend so much labor and money in preparing these reports
and sending them half way to the people, would it not be wise to expend a
little more and complete the journey, by making it the duty of the
assessor to leave a copy on every farmer's table?As an explanation of much of the above, it must be remembered that we are
nearly all recently from the East, that we have brought with us our
Eastern experience, education, literature, and household gods; and that
not until we have tried things in our old Eastern ways and failed, do we
realize that we exist under a new and different state of things and slowly
begin to open our eyes to the existence of Western agricultural reports
and papers giving us the conditions on which the best results have been
obtained.There will be more grass seed planted this spring than ever before, and
the farmers will be guided by the conditions on which the best successes
seem to have been obtained.But this seeding will not give us much grass
for this coming summer.I write for our Western farmers
who have no clover, orchard grass, blue grass, but have in their
cultivated fields.This grass, the most troublesome weed of the West, smothering our gardens
and converting our growing corn-fields into dense meadows, makes the best
hog pasture in the world, while it lasts.Put hogs into a pasture
containing all the tame grasses, with one corner in crab grass, and the
last named grass will all be consumed before the other grasses are
touched.Not only do they prefer it to any other grass, but on no grass will they
thrive and fatten so well.Last spring I fenced twelve acres of old stalk
ground well seeded to crab grass.With the first of June the field was
green, and from then until frost pastured sixty large hogs, which, with
one ear of corn each, morning and evening, became thoroughly fat.These
were the finest and cheapest hogs I ever grew.This grass is in its glory from June till frosts.By sowing the ground
early in oats, this will pasture the hogs until June, when the crab grass
will occupy all the ground, and carry them through in splendid condition,
and fat them, with an ear or corn morning and evening.NOTE.--Many of our readers may be unfamiliar with the variety of grass
spoken of by our correspondent.It is known as crop grass, crab grass,
wire grass, and crow's foot (_Eleusine Indica_).Flint describes it as
follows: Stems ascending, flattened, branching at the base; spikes, two to
five, greenish.It is an annual and flowers through the season, growing
from eight to fifteen inches high, and forming a fine green carpeting in
lawns and yards.It is indigenous in Mississippi, Alabama, and adjoining
States, and serves for hay, grazing, and turning under as a fertilizer.It
grows there with such luxuriance, in many sections, as never to require
sowing, and yields a good crop where many of the more Northern grasses
would fail.--[ED.J. B. Turner, of Jacksonville, Ill., whom almost
every reader of THE PRAIRIE FARMER in days gone by knows, personally, or
by his writings, in company with one of his sons conceived the idea of
running an Illinois stock farm in connection with a ranch in Texas.The
young animals were to be reared on the cheap lands in the latter State
where care and attention amount to a trifle, and to ship them North to
finish them off for market on the blue grass and corn of the Illinois
farm.To carry out this purpose they purchased nearly 10,000 acres in
Coleman county, Texas, and they converted 1,000 acres in a body in
Montgomery county, Illinois, into a home stock farm.Unfortunately, just
as all things were in readiness for extensive operations, the son died,
leaving the business to Prof.Turner, now nearly an octogenarian and
entirely unable to bear the burden thus forced upon him.As a consequence,
he desires to sell these large and desirable possessions, separate or
together, as purchasers may offer.The Illinois farm is well fenced and in a high state of cultivation.There
are growing upon it more than 2,000 large evergreens, giving at once
protection to stock and beauty to the landscape.There are also 1,500
bearing fruit trees, a vineyard, and a large quantity of raspberries,
blackberries, currants, etc.Besides a good farm-house, there is a large barn, in which there are often
fed at one time 150 head of horses, with plenty of room for each animal;
and an abundance of storage room in proportion for grain and hay.Also a
large sheep shed, the feeding capacity of which is 3,000 head.Also a
large hog house, conveniently divided into pens with bins for grain.Other
numerous out-buildings, granary, hay sheds, stock and hay scales, etc.,
etc.There are on the farm twelve miles of Osage orange hedge, the best
kind of fence in the world, in perfect trim and full growth; and four
miles of good rail fence, dividing the farm off into conveniently sized
fields of forty, eighty and one hundred and sixty acres each, access to
which is easily obtained by means of gates which open from each field into
a private central road belonging to the farm, and directly connected with
the stock yards near the house, so that it is not necessary to pass over
other fields in the handling of stock.Stockmen will appreciate this
arrangement.Owing to its special advantages for handling stock, it has
become widely known as a "Model Stock Farm."The lands are all naturally
well drained; no flat or wet land, and by means of natural branches, which
run through every eighty acres, the whole farm is conveniently and easily
watered, by an unfailing supply.There are besides three large wind mills,
with connecting troughs for watering the stock yards and remotest field.It is therefore specially
adapted for all kinds of stock raising, and is well stocked.It has on it
a fine drove of Hereford cattle and Norman horses, and is otherwise fully
equipped with all the recent improvements in farming implements.This farm
is only about fifty miles from St.Louis, Mo., two miles from a railroad
station, and six miles from Litchfield, Illinois.Besides its location
commercially, and its advantages for handling stock, this farm is in one
of the best wheat and fruit producing sections of Illinois, and has now on
it 200 acres of fine wheat.The ranch in Texas consists of one body of 9,136 acres of choice land.By
means of an unfailing supply of living water the whole ranch is well
watered, and has besides a very large cistern.The soil is covered with
the Curly Mesquite grass, the richest and most nutritious native stock
grass known in Texas.There is also on the ranch a splendid growth of live
oak trees, the leaves of which remain green the year round, furnishing
shade in summer, and an ample protection for stock in winter.There is on the ranch a large well built stone house, and also a fine
sheep shed, with bins for 5,000 bushels of grain.This shed is covered
with Florida Cypress shingles and affords protection for 2,000 head of
sheep, and can be used just as well for other kinds of stock.Here can be
bred and raised to maturity at a mere nominal cost, all kinds of cattle,
horses, mules, and other stock, no feed in winter being required beyond
the natural supply of grass.After the stock reaches maturity they can be
shipped to the Illinois Farm; and while all the cattle easily fatten in
Texas enough for the market, still as they are generally shipped to St.Louis or Chicago, it costs but little more, and greatly increases the
profits, to first ship them to the Illinois Farm, and put them in prime
condition, besides being near the markets, and placing the owner in
position to take advantage of desirable prices at any time.With horses
and mules this is a special advantage readily apparent to every one.It will be seen at once that any individual with capital, or a stock
company, or partnership of two or more men, could run this farm and ranch
together at a great profit.All the improvements on both being made solely
for convenience and profit and not anything expended for useless show.I do not write this communication from any selfish motive, for I have not
a penny's worth of interest in either farm or ranch, but I want to let
people who are looking for stock farms know that here is one at hand such
as is seldom found, and at the same time to do my life-long friend and
yours a slight favor in return for the great and lasting benefits he has,
in the past, so freely conferred upon the farmers of the State and
country.I know these lands can be bought far below their real value, and the
purchaser will secure a rare bargain.I presume the Professor will be glad
to correspond with parties, giving full particulars as to terms.The Western wool-growers, in convention at Denver, Colorado, March 13th,
unanimously adopted the following memorial to Congress:

     Whereas, The wool-growers of Colorado, Kansas, Utah,
     Wyoming, Nebraska, Idaho, New Mexico, and Minnesota,
     assembled in convention in the city of Denver, the 13th of
     March, 1884, representing 7,500,000 head of sheep,
     $50,000,000 invested capital, and an annual yield of
     35,000,000 pounds of wool, and

     Whereas, Said Industry having been greatly injured by the
     reduction of the tariff bill of May, 1883, and being
     threatened with total destruction by the reduction of 20
     per cent, as proposed by the Morrison tariff bill just
     reported to the House of Representatives by the Committee
     on Ways and Means; therefore

     Resolved, That we, the wool-growers in convention
     assembled, are opposed to the provisions of the Morrison
     bill now before Congress which aim to make a further
     reduction of 20 per cent on foreign wools and woolens, and
     that we ask a restoration of the tariff of 1867 in its
     entirety as relates to wools and woolens, by which, for the
     first time in the industrial history of the country,
     equitable relations were established between the duties on
     wool and those on woolen goods.Resolved, That we pledge ourselves to work for and to aid
     in the restoration of the tariff of 1867 on wools and
     woolens, and request all persons engaged or interested in
     the wool-growing industry to co-operate with us.Resolved, That we as wool-growers and citizens pledge
     ourselves to stand by all committees and associations in
     giving full and complete protection to all American
     industries in need of the same, and cordially invite their
     co-operation in this matter.The memorial concludes with an appeal to Western Senators and
Representatives in Congress to do all in their power to restore the tariff
of 1867.Saturday, March 15, I visited the herds of Messrs.Du Brouck, Schooley and
Fannce northeast of Effingham, Illinois, and carefully examined them with
Mr.F. F. Hunt, of the university, as they were reported affected with
foot-and-mouth disease.In each herd diseased cattle were found; about 20
distinctly marked cases, a few others having symptoms.The disease is
unlike anything I have known, but does not resemble foot-and-mouth disease
as described by any authority.Only the hind feet are affected, and these
without ulceration.In most cases "scouring" was first noticed, followed
by swelling above the hoofs.In the most severe cases, the skin cracked
about the pastern joint or at the coronet.In four cases one foot had come
off.Swelling of pastern and "scouring" were the only symptoms in several
cases.The mouth and udders were healthful; appetites good.In one case
there was slight vesicle on nostril and slight inflammation of gum.Some
animals in contact with diseased ones for weeks remained healthful.Others
were attacked after five weeks' isolation.The most marked cases were of
eight to ten weeks standing.What we saw is not foot and mouth disease as known abroad, nor is the
contagious character of the disease proven from the cases in these herds.G. E. MORROW, UNIVERSITY, CHAMPAIGN, ILL.[Illustration: The Dairy]

Dairymen, Write for Your Paper.The Camembert is one of the variety of French cheeses that find ready sale
in England at high prices.Jenkins describes the process of making
this cheese in a late number of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural
Society of England which information we find condensed in the Dublin
Farmer's Gazette:

The cows are milked three times a day, at 4.30 and 11.30 a. m., and at 6
p. m. In most dairies the evening's milk is highly skimmed in the morning,
butter being made from the cream, and the milk divided into two portions
one of which is added to the morning's and the other to the midday's
milking.The mixture is immediately put into earthen vessels holding
twelve to fifteen gallons each, and after it has been raised to the
temperature of about 86 deg.Fahr., a sufficient quantity of rennet is
added to make the curd fit to be transferred to the cheese moulds in three
or four hours, or, perhaps, a longer interval in winter.The mixture of
the rennet with the milk is insured by gentle stirring, and the pots are
then covered with a square board.The curd is ready for removal when it
does not adhere to the back of the finger placed gently upon it, and when
the liquid that runs from the fingers is as nearly as possible colorless.The curd is transferred, without breaking it more than can be avoided, to
perforated moulds four inches in diameter.The moulds are placed on reed
mats resting on slightly inclined slabs, made of slate, cement, or other
hard material, and having a gutter near the outer edge.The curd remains
in the moulds twenty-four or even forty-eight hours, according to the
season, being turned upside down after twelve or twenty-four hours; that
is, when sufficiently drained at the bottom.After turning the face of the
cheese, the inside of the mould is sprinkled with salt, and twelve hours
afterward the opposite face and the rim of the cheeses are treated in the
same way.The cheeses are then placed on movable shelves round the walls
of the dairy for a day or two, after which the curing process commences by
the cheeses being transferred to the "drying-room," and there placed on
shelves made of narrow strips of wood with narrow intervals between them,
or of ordinary planks with reed mats or clean rye straw.Here the greatest
ingenuity is exerted to secure as dry an atmosphere and as equable a
temperature as possible--the windows being numerous and small, and fitted
with glass, to exclude air, but not light, when the glass is shut, with a
wooden shutter to exclude both light and air; and with wire gauze to admit
light and air, and exclude flies and winged insects, which are troublesome
to the makers of soft cheese.The cheeses are turned at first once a day, and afterward every second
day, unless in damp weather, when daily turning is absolutely necessary.In three or four days after the cheeses are placed in the drying-room they
become speckled; in another week they are covered with a thick crop of
white mold, which by degrees deepens to a dark yellow, the outside of the
cheese becoming less and less sticky.At the end of about a month, when
the cheese no longer sticks to the fingers, it is taken to the finishing
room, where light is nearly excluded, and the atmosphere is kept very
still and slightly damp.Here they remain three or four weeks, being
turned every day or every second day, according to the season, and
carefully examined periodically.When ready for market--that is to say, in
winter, when ripe, and in summer, when half ripe--they are made up in
packets of six, by means of straw and paper, with great skill and
neatness.The Wisconsin Dairymen's Association last year offered prizes for the best
essays on butter-making, the essays not to exceed 250 words.Competition
was active, and many valuable little treatises was the result.The first
prize was won by D. W. Curtis, of Fort Atkinson, and reads as follows.We
commend it to all butter-makers and to all writers of essays as a model of
the boiled-down essence of brevity:

COWS.Pastures should be dry, free from slough-holes, well seeded with different
kinds of tame grasses, so that good feed is assured.If timothy or clover,
cut early and cure properly.Feed corn, stalks, pumpkins, ensilage and
plenty of vegetables in winter.Corn and oats, corn and bran, oil meal in small quantities.Let cows drink only such water as you would yourself.Brush the udder to free it from impurities.Milk in a clean barn, well
ventilated, quickly, cheerfully, with clean hands and pail.Strain while warm; submerge in water 48 degrees.Skim at twelve hours; at twenty-four hours.Care must be exercised to ripen cream by frequent stirrings, keeping at 60
degrees until slightly sour.Better have one cow less than be without a thermometer.Stir the cream thoroughly; temper to 60 degrees; warm or cool with water.Churn immediately when properly soured, slowly at first, with regular
motion, in 40 to 60 minutes.When butter is formed in granules the size of
wheat kernels, draw off the buttermilk; wash with cold water and brine
until no trace of buttermilk is left.Let the water drain out; weigh the butter; salt, one ounce to the pound;
sift salt on the butter, and work with lever worker.Set away two to four
hours; lightly re-work and pack.A MACHINE that can take hay, corn fodder, grass, and grain and manufacture
them into good, rich milk at the rate of a quart per hour for every hour
in the twenty-four, is a valuable one and should be well cared for.There
are machines--cows--which have done this.There are many thousands of them
that will come well up to this figure for several months in the year, and
which will, besides, through another system of organisms, turn out a calf
every year to perpetuate the race of machines.Man has it in his power to
increase the capacity of the cow for milk and the milk for cream.He must
furnish the motive power, the belts, and the oil in the form of proper
food, shelter, and kindly treatment.By withholding these he throws the
entire machinery out of gear and robs himself.KANE COUNTY, MARCH 17.--Snow is nearly all gone.There is but little frost
in the ground.Hay is plenty, winter wheat and
winter rye look green, and have not been winter-killed to any great
extent.Cattle and horses are looking well and are free from disease.We
fear the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease.Every effort should be made
to confine it within its present limits.Its spread in this county of so
great dairy interests would be a great calamity.Our factory men will make
full cream cheese during the summer months.The hard, skim cheese made
last season, and sold at 2 cts per pound, paid the patrons nothing.We
hear of factory dividends for January of $1.60 to $1.66.J. P. B.

Symptoms of Foot-and-Mouth Disease.This disease, which is one of the most easily transmitted of contagious
and infectious diseases of domestic animals, is characterized by the
appearance of vesicles or small bladders on the mucous surfaces and those
parts of the skin uncovered by hair, such as in the mouth, on the gums and
palate, on the tongue, and the internal surface of the lips and cheeks; on
the surface of the udder and teats, and between the claws.The disease
passes through four different stages or periods; but for present purposes
it will be sufficient to merely mention the most prominent of the
successive changes and appearances, as they occur to the ordinary
observer.The incubatory stage, or the time between contamination and the
development of the disease, is very short (from twenty-four hours to one
or two weeks), and the disease is ushered in by the general symptoms of
fever, such as shivering, increased temperature, staring coat, dry muzzle,
dullness and loss of appetite.The animals seek seclusion, preferably in
sheltered places, where they assume a crouched position, or lie down, and
there is more or less stiffness and unwillingness to move.The mouth
becomes hot and inflamed looking, and covered with slime, the breath
fetid; the animal grinds the teeth, smacks with mouth, and has difficulty
in swallowing.There is more or less tenderness of feet and lameness, and
in cows the udder becomes red and tender, the teats swollen, and they
refuse to be milked.Depending upon the intensity of the fever and the
extent to which the udder is affected, the milk secretion will be more or
less diminished, or entirely suspended; but throughout the disease the
quality or constituents of the milk become materially altered; its color
changes to a yellow; it has a tendency to rapid decomposition, and
possesses virulent properties.Soon yellowish-white blisters, of various
sizes, from that of a small pea to a small hickory nut, appear on the
mucous surface within the mouth, and which blisters often in the course of
development become confluent or coalesce.They generally break within two
to three days, and leave bright red, uneven, and ragged sores or ulcers,
to the edges of which adheres shreds of detached epithelial tissue.The
animal now constantly moves the tongue and smacks the mouth, while more or
less copious and viscid saliva continually dribbles from the mouth.The
lameness increases in proportion as the feet are affected, and if the fore
feet are most affected, the animal walks much like a floundered horse,
with the hinder limbs advanced far under the body, and with arched back.The coronet of the claws, especially toward the heels, becomes swollen,
hot, and tender, causing the animal to lie down most of the time.The
blisters, which appear at the interdigital space of the claws, and
especially at the heels, break in the course of a day and discharge a
thick, straw- fluid; the ulcers, which are of intensely red or
scarlet color, soon become covered with exudating lymph, which dries and
forms scabs.On the udder, the blisters appear more or less scattered and
variable, and they are most numerous at the base and on the teats.Ordinarily, the disease terminates in two or three weeks, while the
animal, which during its progress refuses to partake of any other than
sloppy food, gradually regains strength and flesh, and the udder resumes
its normal functions.The mortality at times has proved very great in this
disease when it has appeared with unusual virulency.In common "horse language," these propensities are confounded one with the
other or else no proper and right distinction is made between them.A
horse may be timid without being shy, though he can hardly be said to be
shy without being timid.Young horses in their breaking are timid,
frightened at every fresh or strange object they see.They stand gazing
and staring at objects they have not seen before, fearful to approach
them; but they do not run away from, or shy at them; on the contrary, the
moment they are convinced there is nothing hurtful in them, they refuse
not to approach or even trample upon them.He can not be persuaded to turn toward or even to look at the object he
shies at; much less to approach it.Timid horses, through usage and experience, get the better of their
timidity, and in time become very opposite to fearful; but shy horses,
unless worked down to fatigue and broken-spiritedness, rarely forget their
old sins.The best way to treat them is to work them, day by day,
moderately for hours together, taking no notice whatever of their shying
tricks, neither caressing nor chastising them, and on no account whatever
endeavoring to turn their heads either towards or away from the objects
shied at.With a view of shedding light on the important question of the
contagiousness of glanders, we will mention the following deductions from
facts brought forth by our own experience.That farcy and glanders, which constitute the same disease, are
propagable through the medium of stabling, and this we believe to be the
more usual way in which the disease is communicated from horse to horse.That infected stabling may harbor and retain the infection for months,
or even years; and though, by thoroughly cleansing and making use of
certain disinfecting means, the contagion may probably be destroyed, it
would not perhaps be wise to occupy such stables _immediately_ after such
supposed or alleged disinfection.That virus (or poison of glanders) may lie for months in a state of
incubation in the horse's constitution, before the disease breaks out.We
have had the most indubitable evidence of its lurking in one horse's
system for the space of fifteen weeks.That when a stud or stable of horses becomes contaminated, the disease
often makes fearful ravages among them before it quits them; and it is
only after a period of several months' exemption from all disease of the
kind that a clean bill of health can be safely rendered.A handsome book, beautifully Illustrated, with  diagrams, giving

[Illustration: HORTICULTURAL]

Horticulturists, Write for Your Paper.In THE PRAIRIE FARMER I notice the interesting note of "O."of Sheboygan
Falls, Wis., on the apparent benefit resulting from sand and manure
mulching of pear trees.In the very near future I expect to see much of this kind of work done by
commercial orchardists.Already we have many trees in Iowa mulched with
sand.I wish now to draw attention to the fact that on the rich black prairie
soils west of Saratov--about five hundred miles southeast of Moscow--every
tree in the profitable commercial orchards is mulched with pure river
sand.The crown of the tree when planted is placed about six inches lower
than usual with us in a sort of basin, about sixteen feet across.This
basin is then filled in with sand so that in the center, where the tree
stands, it is three or four inches higher than the general level of the
soil.The spaces between these slight depressions filled with sand are
seeded down to grass, which is not cut, but at time of fruit gathering is
flattened by brushing to make a soft bed for the dropping fruit and for a
winter mulch.The close observer will not fail to notice good reasons for this
treatment.The sand mulch maintains an even temperature and moisture
of the surface roots and soil and prevents a rapid evaporation of the
moisture coming up by capillary attraction from the sub soil.The soil under the sand will not freeze as deeply as on exposed
surfaces, and we were told that it would not freeze as deeply by two feet
or more as under the tramped grass in the interspaces.With the light  sand about the trees, and grass between, the
lower beds of air among the trees would not be as hot by several degrees
as the exposed surface, even when the soil was light  clay.A bed of sand around the trunks of the trees will close in with the
movement of the top by the summer and autumn winds, thus avoiding the
serious damage often resulting from the swaying of the trunk making an
opening in the soil for water to settle and freeze.Still another use is made of this sand in very dry seasons, which as with
us would often fail to carry the fruit to perfection.On the upper side of
large commercial orchards, large cisterns are constructed which are filled
by a small steam pump.When it is decided that watering is needed the sand
is drawn out, making a sort of circus ring around the trees which is run
full of water by putting on an extra length of V spouting for each tree.When one row is finished the conductors are passed over to next row as
needed.To water an orchard of 1,200 trees--after the handy fixtures are
once provided--seems but a small task.After the water settles away, the
sand is returned to its place.In the Province of Saratov we saw orchards with and without the sand, and
with and without the watering.We did not need to ask if the systematic
management paid.The great crops of smooth apples and pears, and the long
lived and perfect trees on the mulched and watered orchards told the whole
story of the needs of trees planted on black soil on an open plain subject
to extreme variations as to moisture and temperature of air and soil.BUDD., IOWA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.The mere "experience" of an individual, whether as a doctor of medicine,
horticulture, or agriculture--however extensive, is comparatively
worthless.Indeed the million "demonstrate it to be mischievous, judging
from the success of quacks and empyrics as to money.An unlimited number
of facts and certificates prove nothing, either as to cause or remedy."Sir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory "explained all the phenomena of
light, except one," and he actually assumed, for it "fits."Nevertheless
it will ever remain the most thinkable mode of teaching the laws of light,
and it is not probable that any more than this will ever be accomplished
as to any natural science--if that can be called science about which we
must admit that "it is not so; but it is as if it were so."Of more than 300 "Osband Summer" which I grafted on the Anger quince
successfully, one remains, and this one was transplanted after they had
fruited in a clay soil, to the same sort of soil between "the old
standard" and a stable, both of which have occupied the same locality and
within twenty yards, during much more than fifty years of my own
observation--this "Osband Summer" flourishes.It has borne fruit in its
present site, but grew so rapidly last year that the blossoms aborted thus
illustrating the large proportion of vital force necessary to the
production of fruit, as the site has a perennial supply of manure from the
old stable.A number of standard trees, of the same variety, developed
beautifully until they attained twenty or thirty feet, but then succumbed
to the blight, after the first effort at fruiting.So also the Beurre
Clairgean etc., etc.Their exposure to the same influences, and their
growth during several years did not occasion the blight, but the debility
which must inevitably attend fruiting seems the most prolific cause.All the phenomena of pear blight can be accounted for, and we are greatly
encouraged in protecting the trees therefrom if, we assume, it is only the
result of weakness and deficient vitality; if so, as in epidemics, all the
pear trees may be poisoned or ergotized, but only the weakest succumb; and
perhaps this debility may be confined to one limb.The practical value of
this view is manifest, as it is impracticable to avoid using the same
knife, and remove every blighted leaf from the orchard.Moreover, if the
limb is a large one, its prompt removal shocks the vitality of the whole
tree[1] and thus renders other parts more vulnerable.On the contrary
view, the limb may be allowed to drop by natural process, precisely as all
trees in a forest shed their lower limbs, leaving hardly a cicatrice or
scar, and this may be insured at any season by a cord of hemp twine,
firmly bound around the limb.The inevitable strangulation, and the
healing of the stump (without the mycelium of fungi which the knife or saw
inevitably propagates by exposing a denuded surface, if not more directly)
proceed more rapidly than the natural slough of limbs by starvation.Moreover the fruit may mature on such limbs during their strangulation, as
this may not be perfected before the subsequent winter.The next practical result of my view is the fundamental importance of all
those means which are calculated to husband the vital force of the tree
during its first effort to fruit; one of these is the use of a soil that
will not produce more than twenty bushels of corn without manure, thus a
large proportion of the setts will be aborted, but one half of what
remains should be removed, and subsequently the area beneath the limbs
should have a wheelbarrow of good compost.D. S.

  Footnote 1: NOTE.--The shock as to vital force is
     demonstrated by the fact that when young trees are not
     trimmed at all their girth increases more rapidly, and they
     bear fruit sooner.Moreover, when old trees are severely
     pruned (though not half the proportion of wood is removed)
     they fail to bear during the next year.I find that a hemp
     cord about the size of the stem of a tobacco pipe
     (one-fourth inch diameter) will soon become imbedded in the
     bark if firmly tied around a limb, and perhaps this size is
     more efficient than a thicker cord.The black walnut is without doubt the most valuable tree we have for the
rich lands of the "corn belt," West, and one which is very easily grown
everywhere if the farmer will only learn how to get it started.How few we
see growing on our prairies.Simply because to have it we must grow
it from the nuts.It is nearly impossible to transplant black walnut trees
of any size and have them live; although it is a fact that whenever a
non-professional attempts to grow them from the nuts he is almost sure to
fail, it is also a fact that there is no tree that is more easily grown
from the seed than this, if we only know how to do it.It is my purpose in this note to tell how to do it, and also how not to do
it.In the first instance we will suppose a man lives where he can gather the
nuts in the woods.When the nuts begin to fall let him plow deeply the
plot of ground he wishes to plant and furrow it off three or four inches
deep, the distance apart he wishes his rows to be.He will then go to the
woods and gather what nuts he wishes to plant, and plant them at once,
just as they come from the tree, covering them just out of sight in the
furrows.This is all there is of it; simple, is it not?But it will not do
to gather a great wagon box full, and let them stand in it until they
heat, or to throw them in a great heap on the ground and let them lay
there until they heat.It will not do, either, to hull them and let them
lay in the sun a week or two, or hull them, dry them and keep them until
spring, and then plant; none of these plans will do if you want trees.Of
course if the nuts are hulled and planted at once they will grow; but this
hulling is entirely unnecessary.Besides, the hulls seem to act as a
special manure for the young seedlings, causing them to grow more
vigorously.Next, we will suppose one wishes to plant walnuts where they can not be
had from the woods, but must be shipped in.There seems to be only one
plan by which this can be done safely every time, which is as follows:
Gather the nuts as they fall from the trees--of course when they begin to
fall naturally all may be shaken down at once--and spread them not over a
foot deep, on the bare ground under the shade of trees.Cover out of sight
with straw or leaves, with some sticks to hold in place called a "rot
heap;" then after they are frozen and will stay so, they may be shipped in
bags, boxes, barrels, or in bulk by the car-load, and then, again, placed
in "rot heaps," as above, until so early in the spring as the soil is in
workable condition.Then plant as directed in the fall, except the soil
should be firmly packed around the nuts.Keep free from weeds by good
cultivation, and in due time you will have a splendid grove.There was an immense crop of walnuts in this district last fall, and
thousands of bushels were put up carefully, in this way, all ready for
shipment before the weather became warm; many more thousands were planted
to grow seedlings from, for, notwithstanding the walnut transplants poorly
when of considerable size, the one year seedlings transplant with as
little loss as the average trees.There is no tree better adapted for planting to secure timber claims with
than the black walnut, and none more valuable when the timber is grown.For this purpose the land should be plowed deeply, then harrowed to
fineness and firmness, and furrowed out in rows four, six, eight, or ten
feet apart.It is best to plant
thickly in the rows, then if too thick they can be thinned out,
transplanting the thinnings, or selling them to the neighbors.They should
be thoroughly cultivated, until large enough to shade the ground, and
thinned out as necessary as they grow larger.A walnut grove thoroughly
cultivated the first ten years will grow at least twenty feet high, while
one not cultivated at all would only grow two to three feet in that time.WIER., LACON, ILL.Why can not Illinois have an Arbor Day as well as Nebraska, or any other
State.There ought to be ten millions of trees planted the coming spring
within its borders--saying nothing of orchard trees--by the roadside, on
lawns, for shade, for wind breaks, for shelter, for mechanical purposes,
and for climatic amelioration.Nearly all our towns and villages need more
trees along the streets or in parks; thousands of our farms are suffering
for them; hundreds of cemeteries would be beautified by them, and
numberless homes would be rendered more pleasant and homelike by an
addition of one, two, or a dozen, to their bleak places.Can not THE
PRAIRIE FARMER start a boom that will lead to the establishment of an
Arbor Day all over the State?For the benefit of those who can not command the usual appliances for
hot-beds, I will say that they can be made so as to answer a good purpose
very cheaply.Take a nice sunny spot that is covered with a sod, if to be
had.Dig off the sod in squares and pile them carefully on the north side
and the ends of the pit, to form the sides of the bed, with a proper
<DW72>.The soil thrown out from the bottom may be banked up against the
sods as a protection.After the bed is finished, the whole may be covered
with boards, to turn the water off.These answer in the place of glass
frames.As the main use for a hot-bed is to secure bottom heat, very good
results can be obtained in these cheaply constructed affairs.After the
seeds are up, and when the weather will permit, the boards must be removed
to give light and air--but replaced at night and before a rain.Of course,
where large quantities of plants are to be grown, of tender as well as
hardy sorts, it would be better and safer to go to the expense of board
frames and glass for covering.Of course, all the peach trees, and many of the other stone fruits, and
most of the blackberry and raspberry plants, will show discoloration of
wood when the spring opens--so much so that many will pronounce them
destroyed, and will proceed to cut them away.Peaches have
often been thus injured, and by judicious handling saved to bear crops for
years afterward.But they will need to be thoroughly cut back.Trees of
six or seven years old I have cut down so as to divest them of nearly all
their heads, when those heads seemed badly killed, and had them throw out
new heads, that made large growth and bore good crops the following
season.Cut them back judiciously, and feed them well, but don't destroy
them.Budd's articles on Russian Pears, can fail to be
interested and struck with the prospect of future successful pear culture
in the United States.It is highly probable that Russia is yet to give us
a class of that fruit that will withstand the rigors of our climate.Individual enterprise can, and doubtless
will, accomplish much in that direction; but the object seems to me to be
of sufficient importance to justify State or National action.The great
State of Illinois might possibly add millions to her resources by giving
material aid in the furtherance of this purpose--and a liberal expenditure
by the General Government, through the Department of Agriculture, or the
American Pomological Society, would be more usefully applied than many
other large sums annually voted.At all events, another season of fruitage
ought not to be allowed to pass without some concerted action for the
purpose of testing the question.Some of our strongest nurserymen will likely be moving in the work, but
that will not be enough.The propagator of that fruit, however, who will
succeed in procuring from the European regions a variety of pears that
will fill the bill required by the necessities of our soil and climate,
has a fortune at his command.OLD WINTER

lingers in the lap of spring, truly, this year of grace, 1884.Here it is
the 10th of March, and for over one hundred days we have had
winter--winter; but very few real mild and bright days, such as we had
"when I was a boy."The Mississippi is frozen over still, with no signs of
breaking up, and men, women, and children are sighing for sunshine and
showers, and daisies and violets.The wood and coal bills have been
enormous; the pigs squeal in the open pens, and cattle roam, as usual,
shivering in the lanes and along the streets.The song of a robin
to-morrow morning would be a joyous sound to hear.T. G.


Prunings.Tree-worship among the ancients had a most important influence on the
preservation of forests in circumscribed places.Beautiful groves, which
would otherwise have been sacrificed on the altar of immediate utility,
were preserved by the religious respect for trees.--Milwaukee Sentinel."Small trees have larger roots in proportion, (2) they cost
less, (3) expressage of freight is less--expressing small trees is usually
cheaper than freighting large ones, and then so much more speedy, (4) less
labor handling, digging holes, etc., (5) less exposed to high winds which
loosen roots, and kill many transplanted trees, (6) planters can form
heads and train them to their own liking, (7) with good care in, say five
years, they will overtake the common larger sized trees.Without good
care, better not plant any size."The coming currant is Fay's Prolific.It originated with Lincoln Fay, of
Chautauqua county, N. Y. For many years he endeavored to raise a currant
that would combine the size of the Cherry currant with the productiveness
of the Victoria.To this end he fertilized one with the pollen of the
other, and raised some thousands of seedlings, from out of which he
selected this as the one that most nearly realized his desires.It is now
sixteen years since this seedling was obtained.Fay tested this variety by the side of all the sorts in
cultivation, until becoming convinced of its superiority in several
particulars over any of these, he planted it extensively for his own
marketing.At a late meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the currant
worm came in for a good deal of talk.Satterthwaite said that
hellebore, as we have often printed, was the most effectual "remedy."He
mixed it with water and applied it with a brush or whisk of straw.If not
washed off by rain for twenty-four hours and used every year, the worms
were easily got rid of.Saunders, Superintendent of the Government
Gardens at Washington, and a gentleman thoroughly conversant with every
branch of horticulture, said that there was nothing so effectual with
insects as London purple, and, though equally poisonous as Paris green,
was much cheaper.Tobacco stems and refuse have also been found of great
value in fruit culture.Pyrethrum, he said, would also kill all sorts of
leaf-eating insects; it is now largely cultivated in California, and is
hardy at least as far north as Washington.JOSIAH HOOPES in New York Tribune: In Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
where, literally, no pears have been grown of late years, the Kieffer is
doing well.I ate specimens last season
finely flavored and delicious; again when they were weak and watery.This
fruit needs thinning on the trees and careful ripening in the house.Don't
understand me to say that Kieffer is "best of all."But here it is the
most profitable for market that I know of, as this is not a pear country,
as are portions of New York State.As we go further south the Kieffer
seems to improve, and I think Mr.Berckmans, of Georgia, will give it a
good name with him.Yes, the Kieffer will command a higher price in
Philadelphia than any other pear, and we think some people there know what
good fruit is.Don't imagine I have any axe on the grindstone in this
matter; pecuniarily the Kieffer is no more to me than the Bartlett or
dozens of other varieties.[Illustration: FLORICULTURE]

Some New Plants.ABUTILON THOMSONII PLENA.It is one of the peculiarities of plant culture, that after a certain
number of years of cultivation, any plant having the properties of
sporting freely, that is, changing greatly from the original wild
character of the plant, will become double.In most cases it first arises
from seed, but with the plant under notice it appears that it was what is
called a bud variation, that is, that from some freak of a particular
branch of a plant of the well-known A. Thomsonii, the ordinary single
flowers were found to be double.This happening on a plant under the eye
of a professional florist was taken off the plant and rooted, and at once
became its established character.This phenomena of variation being
"fixed" by separate propagation, is by no means rare, and not a few of our
choice fruits, flowers, and vegetables had their origin by the same means.It remains to be seen whether in this case it will be of much value except
as a curiosity, it having precisely the same leaf markings as the
original, which are a very distinct yellow mottling of the leaf in a field
of green, and for which the plant is valuable alone, the flowers being
quite of a secondary character.The flowers are said to be perfectly
double, resembling in form a double hollyhock, color deep orange, shaded
and streaked with crimson.This is the first year it has been sent out,
and we shall not be surprised if it is soon followed by others, for
usually, when the "double" condition of things has arrived no one has a
monopoly of the curiosity.ALTERNANTHERA AUREA NANA.This is a charming new plant of decided merit to the carpet style of
bedding or edging, being very compact in growth, easily kept to a line of
the finest character, and producing what is of great importance in the
summer, a line of golden yellow.At times the old kind, A. aurea, would
come very good, but more often it had far too much of a green shade to
furnish the contrast sought after, and, as a result, failed to bring out
the effect the planter studied to produce.It is a fitting companion to A.
amabilis, A. paronychioides, and A. versicolor, and will be hailed with
delight by our park florists and other scientific planters.BOUVARDIA THOMAS MEEHAN.Here we have a double scarlet bouvardia from the same raisers, Nanz and
Neuner, that astonished the floral world a few years back, with the double
white B. Alfred Neuner.This new addition, unlike the old, which was
another "bud variation," was secured by a cross between the old B.
leiantha, scarlet with a single flower, and Alfred Neuner, double white.If this is the real origin of the kind, which we somewhat doubt, for if
our theory is correct, that a certain amount of cultivation predisposes to
double variation, then it is not necessary to cross the double, which in
fact can not be done with a perfectly double flower--the organs of
fructification being wanting with that of a single and seed-producing
kind, to account for the origin of a new double.As is well known the old leiantha is one of the best scarlets yet, and
this new candidate for favor is said to unite the brilliant color and
profuse blooming qualities of the old favorite B. leiantha with the
perfect double flowers of B. Alfred Neuner.There are now of this class of plants the three colors--white, scarlet,
and pink--in double as well as single; for instance, a pink President
Garfield sported from and was "fixed" from the white A. Neuner, a year or
two ago.In this we have a right regal plant.We first heard of it from the German
catalogues, early in the past winter.This plant is now offered for sale
by the florists of this country.Its description from the catalogues is as
follows: "One of the finest novelties in the list of showy annuals lately
introduced.Its branching flower spikes, of a very bright rose, with a
crimson shade, appear successively from ten to fifteen on each plant, and
measure, each, fully fifteen to eighteen inches in height, and from
one-half to one inch in breadth; the foliage, laying flat on the ground,
is comparatively small, and completely hidden by the numerous flower
spikes, each leaf being five inches long, and from one-half to two inches
broad, undulated and glaucous.It is constantly in bloom during the summer
and autumn, and when in full bloom is a truly magnificent sight, being one
mass of flowers."This class of plants are great favorites, and we should
judge by the  flowers and description that this variety is a
decided novelty.TEA ROSES, WHITE BON SILENE.This is another new aspirant for favor, and comes out with the high
sounding character of being in a white what the old Bon Silene is as a red
winter tea rose.The description from the catalogue is: "The buds are
larger and more double than its parent (the red B.and will produce
more flower buds than any other white rose in cultivation."It was raised by Francis Morat, of Louisville, Ky., four years ago; it is
also a "sport," and from the old B. silene.Should it retain the good
flowering qualities, fragrance, and substance of the original kind, with a
pure white bud, it will very soon work its way into popular favor.Usually
a white variation has not the vitality that its  progenitor had, so
that we say, wait and see.[Illustration: OUR BOOK TABLE]

No city upon the American continent has a larger floating population than
Washington.It is estimated that during the sessions of Congress
twenty-five thousand people, whose homes are in various parts of this and
other countries, make this city their place of residence.Some come here,
attracted by the advantages the city offers for making the acquaintance of
public men; others have various claims which they wish to present, while
the great majority gather here, as crows flock to the carrion, for the
sole purpose of getting a morsel at the public crib.The latter class, as
a general thing, originate the many schemes which terminate in vicious
bills, all of which are either directed at the public treasury or toward
that revenue which the black-mailing of corporations or private
enterprises may bring.While walking down Pennsylvania avenue the other day I met Mr.William M.
Ashley, formerly of your city, whose long residence here has made him
unusually well acquainted with the operations of the lobby.Having made my wants in this particular direction known, in answer to an
interrogative, Mr.Ashley said:

"Yes, during my residence here I have become well acquainted with the
workings of the 'Third House,' as it is termed, and could tell you of
numerous jobs, which, like the 'Heathen Chinee,' are peculiar.""You do not regard the lobby, as a body, vicious, do you?""Not necessarily so, there are good and bad men comprising that body; yet
there have been times when it must be admitted that the combined power of
the 'Third House' has overridden the will of the people.The bad influence
of the lobby can be seen in the numerous blood-bills that are introduced
at every session.""Easily enough, to the person who has made the thing a study."Tell me, to what bills do you refer?""Well, take the annual gas bills, for instance.They are introduced for
the purpose of bleeding the Washington Gas Light company.They usually
result in an investigating committee which never amounts to anything more
than a draft upon the public treasury for the expenses of the
investigation.Another squeeze is the _abattoir_ bills, as they are
called.These, of course, are fought by the butchers and market-men.The
first attempt to force a bill of this description was in 1877, when a
prominent Washington politician offered a fabulous sum for the franchise.""Anything else in this line that you think of, Mr."Yes, there's the job to reclaim the Potomac flats, which, had it become a
law, would have resulted in an enormous steal.The work is now being done
by the Government itself, and will rid the place of that malarial
atmosphere of which we hear so much outside the city.""During your residence here have you experienced the bad results of living
in this climate?""Well, while I have not at all times enjoyed good health, I am certain
that the difficulty which laid me up so long was not malarial.It was
something that had troubled me for years.A shooting, stinging pain that
at times attacked different parts of my body.One day my right arm and leg
would torture me with pain, there would be great redness, heat and
swelling of the parts; and perhaps the next day the left arm and leg would
be similarly affected.Then again it would locate in some particular part
of my body and produce a tenderness which would well nigh drive me
frantic.There would be weeks at a time that I would be afflicted with an
intermitting kind of pain that would come on every afternoon and leave me
comparatively free from suffering during the balance of the twenty-four
hours.Then I would have terrible paroxysms of pain coming on at any time
during the day or night when I would be obliged to lie upon my back for
hours and keep as motionless as possible.Every time I attempted to move a
chilly sensation would pass over my body, or I would faint from hot
flashes.I suffered from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles and a
soreness of the back and bowels, and even my eyeballs become sore and
distressed me greatly whenever I wiped my face.I became ill-tempered,
peevish, fretful, irritable and desperately despondent.""Of course you consulted the doctors regarding your difficulty?"Some told me I had neuralgia;
others that I had inflammatory rheumatism, for which there was no cure,
that I would be afflicted all my life, and that time alone would mitigate
my sufferings.""But didn't they try to relieve your miseries?""Yes, they vomited and physicked me, blistered and bled me, plastered and
oiled me, sweat, steamed, and everything but froze me, but without avail.""I had a friend living in Michigan who had been afflicted in a similar way
and had been cured.He wrote me regarding his recovery and advised me to
try the remedy which cured him.I procured a bottle and commenced its use,
taking a teaspoonful after each meal and at bed-time.I had used it about
a week when I noticed a decrease of the soreness of the joints and a
general feeling of relief.I persevered in its use and finally got so I
could move around without limping, when I told my friends that it was
Warner's Safe Rheumatic Cure that had put me on my feet.""And do you regard your cure as permanent?""Certainly, I haven't been so well in years as I am now, and although I
have been subjected to frequent and severe changes of weather this winter,
I have not felt the first intimation of the return of my rheumatic
trouble.""Do you object to the publication of this interview, Mr.I look upon it as a duty I owe my fellow creatures to
alleviate their sufferings so far as I am able, and any communication
regarding my symptoms and cure that may be sent to me at 506 Maine avenue
will receive prompt and careful attention.""Judging from your recital, Mr.Ashley, there must be wonderful curative
properties about this medicine?""Indeed, there is, sir, for no man suffered more nor longer than did I
before this remedy gave me relief.""To go back to the original subject, Mr.Ashley, I suppose you see the
same familiar faces about the lobby session after session?""No, not so much so as you might think.New faces are constantly seen and
old ones disappear.The strain upon lobbyists is necessarily very great,
and when you add to this the demoralizing effect of late hours and
intemperate habits and the fact that they are after found out in their
steals, their disappearance can easily be accounted for.""What proportion of these blood-bills are successful?"Notwithstanding the power and influence of
the lobby, but few of these vicious measures pass.Were they successful it
would be a sad commentary upon our system of government, and would
virtually annihilate one branch of it.The great majority of them are
either reported adversely or smothered in committee by the watchfulness
and loyalty of our congressmen."J. E. D.

At the next American Fat Stock Show in Chicago, there promises to be an
extensive exhibit of dairy products.The Illinois Dairymen's Association
will have it in charge, and the State Board of Agriculture has decided to
appropriate $500 as a premium fund for the Dairymen's Association.It is
rather strange, yet nevertheless true, that Illinois has never yet had an
exhibition of dairy products at all commensurate with the importance of
the dairy interest of the State.It may now be reasonably predicted that
this remark will not remain true after November next.We have heard
nothing said about it, but it is to be presumed there will be no extra
charge to visit this exhibit.The managers of the Fat Stock Show have not
been satisfied, we believe, with experiments in this direction.*     *     *     *     *

Many years ago a young Scotch gardener brought from Mexico to Kenosha,
Wis., a specimen of the Century plant.It was then supposed to be about
twenty years old.For more than forty years this man cared for his pet
with unflagging faithfulness.Dying at the age of sixty-five he left it to
the care of a little daughter of a lady who had shown him kindness.This
girl grew to womanhood and to middle age caring tenderly for the plant.About two years ago the plant exhibiting signs of blooming, a gentleman
joined with the lady and erected a building for it near the Exposition
building, in this city.Here it has since been, but through carelessness
it was unduly exposed to the terrible freeze of the first week in January
last, and the plant is now past recovery.The lady had expended upon it
about all the means she possessed expecting to reap from admission fees to
see it a rich reward.Thus eighty years of care and constant expense came
to naught in a single night.A neglect to order coal resulted in the fire
going out just when the cold was the most intense.One can hardly imagine
the disappointment and regret of the lady who had nursed it with such care
for nearly a lifetime.The white pine lumber product of the Northwest last year was according to
latest returns, 7,624,789,786 feet against 3,993,780,000 in 1873, and more
than double what it was in 1874.In 1882 the production was nearly
100,000,000 feet less than last year.The smallest product of the decade
was in 1877--3,595,333,496 feet.What is termed the Chicago District,
including the points of Green Bay, Cheboygan, Manistee, Ludington, White
Lake, Muskegon, Grand Haven, and Spring Lake, and a few scattering mills
gave a product in 1883 of 2,111,070,076 feet.At Ludington and Grand Haven
there has been a decline in the product since 1873; at all the other
points the increase has been considerable, amounting to a total of nearly
800,000,000 feet.The largest cut is on the Mississippi river in what is
known as the West of Chicago District.Here in 1873 the product amounted
to 650,000,000 feet; last year it reached 1,290,062,690 feet.The Saginaw
Valley gives the next greatest yield 961,781,164 feet.The total Saginaw
district gave last year 1,439,852,067 feet against 792,358,000 ten years
ago.The total of the West of Chicago District was 3,134,331,793 against
1,353,000,000 in 1873.The Railroad and Interior Mills District has
increased something over 200,000,000 feet in this period.In shingles we have the grand product in all the Northwest of
3,964,736,639 against 2,277,433,550 in 1873.The greatest increase was in
the Chicago District as given above, and here Ludington and Grand Haven
come in for an increase at the former place of over 33,000,000, and the
latter of more than 100,000,000.The total production of shingles in 1882
was larger than last year by about 130,000,000, but with that exception
was the largest ever known.The census of 1880 placed the annual lumber product of the United States
at 18,000,000,000 feet.The Northwest then produced 5,651,295,000 feet or
nearly one-third the entire product of the country.If this ratio has been
uniform since we must now have a yield of over 20,000,000,000 feet.These
are figures of enormous magnitude and of varied import.They mean
employment to an army of men, a large shipping interest, vast investments
in mills and machinery, and vast incomes to owners of pine lands; they
mean houses and barns and fences to a new and populous empire; they mean
numberless farms and millions of live stock.They also signify a rapid
destruction of our immense forests from the face of the earth, enormous
prices for lumber to future generations, and possible floods to devastate
our river bottoms, and drouths to scourge the highlands.They should
impress us all with the necessity and the profitableness of timber
planting on the unsettled and newly settled prairies and in thousands of
places in all the older States.FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.Alarming reports from different parts of the country announcing the
presence of foot-and-mouth disease have caused no inconsiderable
excitement among the people and in Government circles.First there came
news of an outbreak in Effingham county, Illinois, then in Louisa county,
Iowa, quickly followed by similar information from Adair county, Missouri.Paaren, dispatched to Effingham county by the Governor, reports the
trouble there not foot-and-mouth disease.There does exist a disease
there, however, similar to foot-rot in sheep, that is proving fatal to
many cattle.There have also been outbreaks of disease among cattle near
Duquoin and Xenia, Illinois, which Dr.Paaren has been directed to
investigate.No official reports as to the disease in Iowa and Missouri have been
received, though Government Veterinary inspectors are now upon the ground
making their investigations.It is said that several hundred head of
cattle are affected in Missouri, though this is probably an exaggeration.There is no news regarding the disease in Maine.Reports from Kansas say the infected herds are strictly quarantined, and
that as yet no fresh outbreaks have occurred.It is proposed to annihilate
the five infected herds.Glick has convened the Legislature of Kansas in order that proper
measures may be taken to protect the cattle interests of the State.A Des Moines dispatch dated the 15th, says letters from Louisa county to
the Governor in regard to the new cattle disease were read in the House,
and on motion of Mr.Watrous that body adopted the substitute for the bill
providing for the appointment of a State veterinary surgeon.The
substitute authorizes the veterinary surgeon to destroy all stock affected
with contagious disease.The bill is intended to enable the State to take
action in the foot-and-mouth disease now affecting the stock.Discussion
then followed upon the substitute, which was taken up section by section,
and it was for the most part adopted.The series of reported outbreaks mentioned has aroused Congress to the
necessity of action.The Senate on Monday passed a joint resolution
appropriating $50,000 for the suppression of the disease in whatever State
or Territory it appears.It is to be hoped that the Animal Industry bill will at once pass and
become a law.The cattle dealers at the Chicago Union Stock Yards have
organized a Live Stock Exchange, and the first action taken by it is to
fight this bill in Congress.Emory A. Storrs, attorney for the heavy
brokers, is in Washington working might and main for its defeat.He finds
it uphill work, evidently, for on Monday he sent a dispatch to Nelson
Morris in these words: "Send to-day a delegation of strong men; everything
now depends on backing; wire me at once protest; have seen several
senators this morning; advise me when delegation starts; have them stop at
Riggs house."Acting under this advice the Exchange passed the following resolutions of
"unbelief."Whereas, It is the universal sentiment of the Chicago Live
     Stock Exchange, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, that
     the bill now pending before Congress, known as the "Animal
     Industry bill," is dangerous in its design, not called for
     by the condition of the live stock interest in this
     country, and tends to place too much power in the
     Department of Agriculture at Washington; therefore,

     Resolved, That Elmer Washburn, Allan Gregory, F. D.
     Bartlett, B. F. Harrison, and H. H. Conover, members of
     this exchange, be, and hereby are, appointed a committee,
     with instructions to proceed forthwith to Washington, and
     present these resolutions to the proper authorities to
     prevent the passage of said "Animal Industry bill."Resolved, Further, that owing to the present excitement
     throughout the United States over the false alarm of
     pleuro-pneumonia and "foot-and-mouth" disease, that we, as
     a body, should express our views fully upon this question.We do not believe there is such a disease as contagious
     pleuro-pneumonia existing throughout the United States.We do not believe that such a disease as the
     foot-and-mouth disease exists in either Illinois, Iowa, or
     Kansas.That at no time within the space of twenty years have
     the cattle, sheep, or hogs of this country been in as
     healthy a condition as at the present time; for while we
     are in favor of strict quarantine laws to prevent any
     importation of disease into this country from abroad, we
     believe if any disease should break out in this State, or
     any other State, that the citizens would be interested
     sufficiently to stamp it out without expense to the
     National Government.Detmers appeared in the
hall (accidentally of course!)and gave it as his opinion that not a
single case of foot-and-mouth disease existed in America to-day.But the
Doctor has so often put his foot in it in his mouthings about animal
diseases in the past that his beliefs or disbeliefs have little weight
with the public.The Doctor is evidently "put out" because he was not
called upon to visit the infected districts, for he is reported as ending
his harangue by declaring he was tired of working for the Government, and
offered his services to the Live Stock Exchange.Such, in brief, is a summary of the news of the week concerning the
foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the States.As briefly stated in a previous issue of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, the Illinois
State Board of Agriculture offers a premium of $100 for the best bushel of
corn (in ear) grown this year in the northern division of the State, and
$50 for the second best bushel: and a like premium for the best and second
best bushel grown in the central and southern divisions.These divisions
correspond with the three judicial divisions of the State.The following
are the conditions:

Each of the parties awarded the first premium to deliver twenty-five
bushels, and each of the parties awarded the second premium to deliver
fifteen bushels of corn in the ear in sacks to the State Board of
Agriculture at Springfield, Ill.The corn delivered to be equal in quality
to the samples awarded the respective premiums.The premiums to be paid
when the premium bushels of corn and the amounts called for are compared
at the rooms of the Department of Agriculture and favorably reported upon
by the committee.Affidavit as to measurement of land and yield of corn are required.We suppose also that competitors are to furnish characteristics of soil,
variety of seed, kinds of manure used, mode of cultivation etc., as these
facts would seem to be necessary if the public is to receive the full
benefits of the experiments the premiums are likely to bring out.It is understood that the corn delivered to the State Board as per above
conditions is to be in some judicious manner distributed to the
corn-growers of the State for planting in 1885.THE FIRST UNFORTUNATE RESULT.There recently began in Scotland an earnest movement to induce the British
Government to remove the restrictions regarding the importation of
American cattle, so far at least as to allow the admission of store cattle
for feeding purposes.Meetings have been held in various parts of Scotland
at which petitions like the following were adopted.To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone.We, the undersigned, farmers and others, respectfully
     submit that the present law which allows the importation of
     cattle from the United States, and shuts out store cattle,
     is unjust and oppressive to the farmers of this country,
     and enhances the price of meat to the public.We therefore
     crave that her Majesty's Government would open the Scottish
     ports to the introduction of store cattle from the Western
     States where disease does not exist.At a meeting at Montrose, where the above petition was favorably acted
upon, Mr.Falconer, an Angus farmer, in supporting the motion, said that
the first great remedy for the present depression was to get cheap store
cattle, and that would never be got until they opened their ports to the
Western States of America.He held that if farmers would agree to insist
on live store cattle being allowed to be landed in Britain, they would
soon get them.When they get them, he, if then alive, would be quite
willing to take all the responsibility if they found an unsound or
unhealthy animal amongst them.He appealed to butchers in Montrose, who
had been in the way of killing States or Canadian cattle, if they were not
totally free of disease; and he would like to ask them how many Irish
cattle they killed which were perfectly healthy.If they got stores from
America, they would not effect a saving in price, but, as they all knew,
sound healthy cattle fed much quicker than unsound, and were of better
quality, and thus an additional item of profit would be secured to the
farmer.A. Milne, cattle-dealer, Montrose, corroborated Mr.Falconer's
statements as to the healthiness of American stock, while Irish cattle, as
a rule, he said, had very bad livers.Adamson, Morphie, said he had recently been in the Western States of
America, and had seen a number of the ranches in Nebraska, Wyoming, and
Colorado.The cattle there were certainly fine animals--well bred, as a
rule, either from Herefords or Short-horns, with a dash of the Texan
cattle in them.When there, he made careful inquiries as to the existence
of disease, and he was universally told that such a thing as epidemic
disease was unknown.No doubt in the southern part of Texas there was a
little Texan fever, but that, like yellow fever, was merely indigenous to
the district.He considered it would
be a great boon to the farmers of Scotland if they could get cattle L3 or
L4 cheaper than at present.It would save a very considerable amount of
money in stocking a farm, and would also tell on the profits of the
feeders, and the prices paid by the consumers.They had them to spare in
America in the greatest possible abundance.At a late meeting of the Prairie Cattle Company, having headquarters in
Scotland, sheriff Guthrie Smith expressed the opinion that the great
profit in the future of American ranch companies must be the trade in
young cattle.He believed that Scottish farmers would ere long get all
their young cattle, not from Ireland, but from the United States.It did
not pay them to breed calves; they were better selling milk.The fattening
of cattle for the butcher was the paying part of the business, but the
difficulty was to get yearlings or two-year-olds at their proper price.Here promised to arise a new outlet for American stock, and one which most
of us probably never thought of.The proposition had in it the elements
for the building up of a great commercial industry and of affording a new
and rapid impetus to the breeding of cattle upon the plains.But just at
this time comes the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Kansas, Maine,
and Illinois, and of course puts an end to all hopes in this direction,
for many months at least.This is the result of the disease at its first
appearance.Here is prospective loss before the Government veterinary
surgeons fairly reach the field of operations against its spread--the loss
of a trade which would have been worth many millions to the cattle raisers
of the great West.It is to be feared that this is but the beginning of
the losses the disease will entail upon us.Can Congress longer hesitate
in this matter of providing an efficient law for protection from
contagious animal diseases?Our State authorities,
also, must be alert, and render all possible aid in preventing the spread
of this wonderfully infectious disease.*     *     *     *     *

We have a large number of letters and postal cards asking where various
seeds, plants, shrubs, trees, silk-worm eggs, bone dust and so on and so
forth to an indefinite extent, may be obtained.We have answered some of
these inquiries by letter, some through the paper, but they still keep
coming.We have one favor to ask of those seeking this sort of
information: First look through the advertisements carefully, and see if
what is wanted is not advertised.The seedsmen's advertisements do not, of
course, enumerate all the parties have for sale, but it may be taken for
granted that they keep nearly all kinds of grass, grain, and vegetable
seeds.We would also say to seedsmen that it will probably be found to pay
them to advertise the seeds of the new grasses, alfalfa, the special
fertilizers, etc., that are now being so much inquired about.We have a
large number of inquiries about where to obtain silk-worm eggs.Persons
who have them certainly make a mistake in not advertising them freely.O. G. B., SHEBOYGAN FALLS, WIS.--Will you give directions which will be
practical for tanning skins or pelts with the fur or hair on by the use of
oak bark?ANSWER.--We know of no way the thing can be done unless a part of the
methods are used that are employed in the tanning of goat skins for making
Morocco leather.These are: to soak the skins to soften them; then put
them into a lime vat to remove the hair, and after to take the lime out in
a douche consisting of hen and pigeon dung.This done, the skins are then
sewed up so as to hold the tanning liquid, which consists of a warm and
strong decoction of Spanish sumac.The skins are filled with this liquid,
then piled up one above the other and subsequently refilled, two or three
times, or as fast as the liquid is forced through the skins.If the furs
or pelts were first soaked to soften them, all the fatty, fleshy matter
carefully removed, after sewed up as goat skins are, and then filled and
refilled several times with a strong decoction of white oak bark, warm,
but not hot, no doubt the result would prove satisfactory.J. F. SCHLIEMAN, HARTFORD, WIS.--Are there any works on the
cultivation of the blueberry, and if so could you furnish the same?Do you
know of any parties that cultivate them?ANSWER.--We have never come across anything satisfactory on the
cultivation of the blueberry except in Le Bon Jardiniere, which says: "The
successful cultivation of the whole tribe of Vacciniums is very difficult.The shrubs do not live long and are reproduced with much difficulty,
either by layers or seeds."The blueberry, like the cranberry, appears to
be a potash plant, the swamp variety not growing well except where the
water is soft, the soil peaty above and sandy below.The same appears also
to be true of the high land blueberry; the soil where they grow is
generally sandy and the water soft.You can procure Le Bon Jardiniere (a
work which is a treasure to the amateur in fruit and plants) of Jansen,
McClurg & Co., of Chicago, at 30 cents, the franc.Some parties, we think,
offer blueberry plants for sale, but we do not recollect who they are.H. HARRIS, HOLT'S PRAIRIE, ILL.--Will it do to tile drain land
which has a hard pan of red clay twelve to eighteen inches below the
surface?ANSWER.--It will do no harm to the land to drain it if there is a hard pan
near the surface, but in order to make tile draining effective on such
land, the drains will have to be at half the distance common on soils
without the hard pan.SUBSCRIBER, DECATUR, ILL.--In testing seed corn, what per cent must sprout
to be called first-class.I have some twenty bushels of Stowell's
Evergreen that was carefully gathered, assorted, and shelled by hand.This I have tested by planting twenty-one grains, of which sixteen grew.ANSWER.--Ninety-five, certainly.If five kernels out of twenty-one failed
to grow, that would be 31 per cent of bad seed, and we should consider the
quality inferior.But further, if under the favorable condition of trial,
31 percent failed, ten grains in every twenty-one would be almost sure to,
in the field.It was a mistake to shell the corn; seed should always
remain on the cob to the last moment, because if it is machine or
hand-shelled at low temperature, and put away in bulk, when warm weather
comes, it is sure to sweat, and if it heats, the germ is destroyed.Better
spread your corn out in the dry, and where it will not freeze, as soon as
you can.L. C. LEANIARTT (?)NEBRASKA.--I wish to secure a blue grass pasture in my
timber for hogs.Will it be necessary to keep them out till the grass
gets a good start?Shall I follow the directions you gave Mr.Perkins
in THE PRAIRIE FARMER, February 9?Is not blue grass pasture the best
thing I can give my hogs?Better do so, and you will then be more likely to get a good
catch and full stand.Blue grass is very good for hogs, but it is improved by the addition of
clover.C. C. SAMUELS, SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--1.What pears would you recommend for
this latitude?I have some grape
vines, light  fruit, but late, Elvira, I think the nurseryman told
me, which appear to be suffering from something at the roots.What is the
phylloxera, and what shall I do to my grape vines if they infest the
roots?ANSWER.--The Bartlett for _certain_--it being the best of all the
pears--and the Kieffer and Le Conte for _experiment_.If the latter
succeed you will have lots of nice large fruit just about as desirable for
eating as a Ben Davis apple in May.We know of one only, the Tyson, a
smallish summer pear that never blights, at least in some localities,
where all others do more or less.If your Elviras are afflicted with
the phylloxera, a root-bark louse, manure and fertilize them at once, and
irrigate or water them in the warm season.The French vine-growers seem at
last to have found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they
do half starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water
carefully to restore their vines to health.J. S. S., SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--I am not a stock man nor a farmer; but I have
some pecuniary interests, in common with others, my friends, in a Kansas
cattle ranch.I am therefore a good deal exercised about this
foot-and-mouth disease.Is it the terrible scourge reported by one cattle
doctor, who, according to the papers, says, "the only remedies are fire or
death."ANSWER.--The disease is a bad one, very contagious, but easily yields to
remedies in the first stages.THOMAS V. JOHNSON, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a report here that your draft
horses of all breeds are not crossing with satisfaction on your common
steeds in Illinois, and that not more twenty five in one hundred of the
mares for the last three years have thrown foal, nor will they the present
season.ANSWER.--Our correspondent has certainly been misinformed, or is an
unconscious victim of local jealousy, as he may easily convince himself by
visiting interior towns, every one of which is a horse market.BY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.A neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and
sheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought
about his doing so.I asked him if he had read what THE PRAIRIE
FARMER and other papers had contained of late regarding foot-and-mouth
disease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa.He had not; did not take the
papers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.Then I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious
character, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your
brief history of the ailment in Great Britain.Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question
about buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards?Just this, I replied:
every day there are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of
cattle from these infected States.Perhaps some of them come from the very
counties where this disease is known to exist.The disease may break out
any day in scores of places in all these States.It may appear--indeed is
quite likely to do so at the stock yards.For aught I know it may be there
now.The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an
unwelcome fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to.In fact, from
what they have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent
enactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to
conceal cases that may really exist.Now you go there to pick up cattle to
consume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run
the risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost
you and your neighbors many thousands of dollars?If I were you I would
pick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though
not exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a
great deal more time and trouble.You see to a Man of the Prairie things
look a little squally in this cattle business.We have all got to be
careful about this thing.We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and
pasture gates, and we must guard them well.I am not an alarmist, but I
would run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always
tried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen.I am
in favor of _in_-trenchment.Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not
sound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it
till I hear more from the infected districts.To show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States this
way and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that it
knows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken
between the middle of November and the first of March.Still, these
Eastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live
in.Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do
their plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the
ground a bit.In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of
acclimated, as it were.We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,
good schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as
well as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in
December and January.We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or
Washington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest
where a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in
the year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have
the excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.I like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and Florida--for
other people who like to make their homes there, but my home is here and I
like it."I don't _have_ to" plow in winter, and I don't need to.I am
going to try to do my duty and be happy where I am, believing Heaven to be
just as near Illinois as any other State or any Territory.I read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near Omaha
burned the other night.With the barns were consumed twenty-six cows,
eighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and oats.In
all the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no insurance.From
all over the country and at all times of the year I read almost daily of
similar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands, and the closing
sentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements is "no
insurance."Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod
peddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and
these are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their
contents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in
sufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.True, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these
luxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has
brought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property
is swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my
family, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to
furnish them a shelter.I don't take _cheap_ insurance either, but invest
my money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant capital
and is cautiously managed.A wealthy man can take his fire risks in his
own hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means it seems
to me the height of folly to do so.I would rather go without tobacco or
"biled shirts" than insurance and lightning rods.I don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout.Certainly I never
heard of such a case.If one does get the ailment, however, if he keeps
bees he always has a sure remedy at hand.A German has discovered that if
a bee is allowed to sting the affected part, a cure is instantaneous.Why
don't Bismarck try this home remedy for his complication of gout and
trichinae?REMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the

[Illustration: Poultry Notes.]One of my correspondents writes: "My hens don't eat well--they just pick
over the food as if it were not good enough for them--and they don't lay
well; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope about--not as
if sick, but as if lazy."Probably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,
and the hens are getting tired of it.Hens are like other people--they
like a change of provender once in awhile--especially when confined
indoors.Sometimes over-feeding will cause indigestion, and then the
biddies will exhibit the symptoms you describe.In either case, let the
fowls fast for a whole day, and then for a few days feed lightly with food
that is different from what they have been living on.Give plenty of green
food, also Douglas' mixture in the drinking water twice a week.Another correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked food
to fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.I advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much
better for poultry than the raw articles would be.Because raw bugs and
worms constitute the "natural diet" of fowls in their wild state, it does
not follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most
economical food for our domestic fowls.Other things being equal, chicks
that are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and
thrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked rations.If you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the hens
do double duty.Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks come
out, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again.To do
this successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as dry
and given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves the
nest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go
back.Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and
the hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.A lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me
that she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for
information about advertising, packing eggs, etc.The advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy of
your "ad.," send it to THE PRAIRIE FARMER and other papers that circulate
among farmers, pay the bills, and answer the postals and letters as they
come.But if I were in your shoes, I would "put my foot down" on the
postals to begin with; they don't amount to anything anyway; the people
who ask a long string of questions on a postal card are not, as a rule,
the ones who become customers.Before we went into the poultry business an
old poultry-breeder said: "Don't have anything to do with postals, it
don't pay."We thought differently, but to satisfy ourselves, we kept
track of the postals, and to-day I have the addresses of over 300 people
who wrote us on postal cards.Just one, and he was an Ohio man.When I go into that branch of the
poultry business again, my advertisements will contain a postscript which
will read thusly: "No postals answered."And you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people who
have not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your prices,
etc., and you must answer them all alike.Here is where circulars save
lots of work and postage.I have sent you by mail what I call a model
circular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case.Pack
your eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg
separately in paper.The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.Put plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine
sew on a cover of stout cotton cloth.For the address use shipping tags,
or else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter
way.A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your
customer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.Concerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to
hatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: "I guarantee to furnish fresh
eggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely
any distance.In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly
cared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be
duplicated free of charge."I furnished just what I promised, and when a
total failure was reported I sent the second sitting free--though
sometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once
a man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the
first sitting hatched.But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty
well satisfied.It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a
sitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not
received the worth of his money.In such cases, if both parties are
willing to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all
will be satisfied.And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that
nothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly
as you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.If the lady who wrote from Carroll county, Illinois, concerning an
incubator, will write again and give the name of her postoffice, she will
receive a reply by mail.Although yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is
warm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands
will be upon the wing.It would be well on such days as this to see that
all entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way
of house-cleaning.This is all we think necessary for this month, provided
they have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom.Handling bees
tends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim
that this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast.Although more
young may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the
hive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the
death of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses.Sometimes,
also, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they
may fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.Bees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us that
insects during the larvae state consume more food than they do during the
remainder of their existence.Where a bee-keeper has been so improvident
as to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he should
examine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty frame,
substituting a full one in its place.Where frames of honey are not to be
had, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes, which
can be placed over the cluster.Care should be taken that no apertures are
left, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive.These cakes are
thought to excite bees less than when liquid food is given; they have
another advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them while feeding,
and do not get chilled.Bees that have been wintered in cellars, or special repositories, are
often injured by being removed too early to their summer stands.It would
be better to let them remain, and lower the temperature during warm days
with ice, until warm weather has come to stay.An aged veteran in Vermont
that we visited the season following the disastrous winter of 1880-81,
told us that his neighbors removed their bees from the cellar during a
warm spell early in spring, and they were then in splendid condition.He
let his bees remain until pollen was plentiful, and brought them out, all
being in fine order; by this time his neighbors' colonies were all dead.Good judgment and care must be exercised in removing bees from the cellar,
or disastrous results will follow.We know of an apiary of over one
hundred colonies that was badly injured, indeed nearly ruined, by all
being taken from the cellar at once on a fine, warm day.The bees all
poured out of the hives for a play spell, like children from school, and
having been confined so long together in one apartment had acquired, in
some measure, the same scent, and soon things were badly mixed.Some
colonies swarmed, others caught the fever, and piled up together in a huge
mass.This merry making may have been fun for the bees, but it was the
reverse of this for the owner, as many queens were destroyed, and hives
that were populous before were carried from the cellar and left without a
bee to care for the unhatched brood.When it is time to remove bees from the cellar the stands they are to
occupy should be prepared beforehand.They should be higher at the back,
inclining to the front; if the height of two bricks are at the back, one
will answer for the front.This inclination to the front is an important
matter; it facilitates the carrying out of dead bees and debris from the
hive, the escape of moisture, and last, and most important item, bees will
build their comb straight in the frame instead of crosswise of the hive,
and their surplus comb in boxes correspondingly.If a few hives are
removed near the close of the day and put in different parts of the
apiary, the danger from swarming out is avoided, for the bees will become
quiet before morning, and being far apart will not mix up when they have
their play spell.The success of bee-keeping depends upon the faithful
performance of infinite little items.L. L. Langstroth will be pained to learn that
he has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental work.May the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.During the last fall and winter he has been the light of many conventions,
and it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives of many
bee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming
countenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,
and taking the hand of this truly great and good man.L. HARRISON


Extracted Honey.A couple of copies of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have lately come to my desk, a
reminder of my boyhood days, when, in the old home with my father, I used
to contribute an article now and then to its columns.There is an old
scrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now, with some of those articles in
it, published nearly thirty years ago.But my object in writing now is to
add something to Mrs.Last year my
honey crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half of this was extracted, or
slung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it; but for next year I have
decided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the reason that I do not get
customers so readily for extracted honey.I have never extracted until the
honey was all, or nearly all, capped over, and then admitted air into the
vessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure of getting it "dry," and
proof against souring.This method has given me about half the amount
others obtained by extracting as soon as the combs were filled by the
bees, and ripening afterward.But in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against
extracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to
this sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees
themselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that
while my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have
several ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.Especially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an
absolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs.When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean
that all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey
I have ever had never candied at all.In one case I knew the honey to
candy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,
particularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all.This difference
seems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will
crystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.Manufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey
merchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose
with honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.CAMM., MORGAN CO., ILL.South'n Wisconsin Bee-keepers' Ass'n.The bee-keepers met in Janesville, Wis., on the 4th inst., and organized a
permanent society, to be known as the Southern Wisconsin Bee-keepers'
Association.The following named persons were elected officers for the
ensuing year: President, C. O. Shannon; Vice-President, Levi Fatzinger;
Secretary, J. T. Pomeroy; Treasurer, W. S. Squire.The regular sessions of the association will be held on the first Tuesday
of March in each year.Special meetings will also be held, the time of
which will be determined at previous meeting.The object of the association is to promote scientific bee-culture, and
form a bond of union among bee-keepers.Any person may become a member by
signing the constitution, and paying a fee of fifty cents.The next
meeting will be held at the Pember house, Janesville, on the first Tuesday
in May at 10 o'clock A. M. All bee-keepers are cordially invited to

Loaned netting investors 7 per cent.In a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr.L. S.
Pennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: "Many thanks for your
instructive articles on Silk Culture.Could the many miles of Osage orange
found in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give
employment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means
they could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting.I hope that
you will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this
subject."Anent this subject we find the following by Prof.C. V. Riley in a late
issue of the American Naturalist:

"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making
money by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use
of Osage orange as silk-worm food.We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the
most careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is
properly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in
quantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has
been fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without
deterioration.There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if
anything, must be looked upon as an advantage.It is more than likely, how
ever, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the
Maclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from
Morus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in
some depreciation.Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,
has completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,
which he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and
Manufacturer's Gazette.The race
known as the "Var" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves.The "Pyrenean"
and "Cevennes" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage
orange, while the "Milanese" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second
molt and then changed to mulberry leaves.At the close examples of each
variety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,
and appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per
pound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per
pound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between
Maclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per
cent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the
Osage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of
the worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding
during the last three ages.'The experiment, although interesting, is not
conclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the
different tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been
due, to a certain extent, to race and not to food."A writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the
head of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two
bricks, is an effective remedy for cramps.Patients who have suffered at
night, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,
certain, and permanent relief.California stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,
and is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea
water is carried on to any considerable extent.This industry has
increased rapidly during the last twenty years.The production has risen
from 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.The amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is
shown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following
schools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute
at Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'
schools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for
basket weavers, and fourteen for lace making.Besides these there are the
following trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,
endowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for
watchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument
makers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one
for machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,
three for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,
four for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork.There are,
moreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight
agricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.The Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr.Raydt, of
Hanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid
as a motive agent.Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is
reduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates
and expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before.It
is by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to
obtain such important benefits from the agent he employs.A quantity of
the fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,
securely fastened and provided with a duct and valve.By opening the valve
free passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may
be used instead of steam for working in a piston.One of the principal
uses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for
fire engines.Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the
boiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam
is being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the
usual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas.There is,
however, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,
and to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at
Kiel.This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial
bladders.It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet
diameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons.Hitherto
these floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes
from above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr.Raydt merely affixes
a sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the
floats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with
the contents.DAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.[Illustration of a swing churn]

[Illustration: HOUSEHOLD.]For nothing lovelier can be found
  In woman than to study _household_ good.--_Milton._


How He Ventilated the Cellar.The effect of foul air upon milk, cream, and butter was often alluded to
at the Dairymen's meeting at DeKalb.A great bane to the dairyman is
carbonic acid gas.In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious
effect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living
apartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family.W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern
Dairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily
cellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of
food:

"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr.Clapp, the president
of the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any
milk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar.I went and
looked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of
moisture, and then knew what was the matter.Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few
moments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and
wholesome apartment of your house.'I went down and got the professor, and
he went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will
put you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.'He
went to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered
tightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until
it came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square
elbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the
kitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about
four feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered.You know the kitchen
stove in all families is in operation about three times a day.The heat
from this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe
caused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in
twenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of
the cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar.I drop this hint to show you
that it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten
dollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar.This carbonic acid gas is
very heavy.It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless
you dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to
apply something to it that shall operate in this way."This is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that
we had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but
conclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt
it to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands
will make use of Mr.As far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in
the habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of
which are still in use in this country.As soon, therefore, as the
sooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a
sheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage
was supposed to rest.The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which
the bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said.At the
conclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home
of her husband.She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled
with wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning
fresh garments for her husband.The threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;
and in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous
perfumes.As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil
influences, it was disenchanted by various charms.After being thus
prepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered
unlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.The musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their
"Epithalamium."The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's
hands, symbolic of her now being mistress.A cake, too, baked by the
vestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from
the place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided
among the guests.To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the
bridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed
heartily a grand scramble.Once upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,
I think it must have been Smith, Mr.Smith said to her husband: "John, I really think we must
have the stove up in the sitting-room."Smith from behind his
newspaper answered "Well."Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr.Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and
forty-seventh time Mr.Smith added: "I'll get Brown to help me about it
some day."It is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.Smith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help
her husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely
consented and came at once.With a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some
words not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the
stove down from the attic.Smith had placed the zinc in its proper
position, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that
didn't matter.Then they proceeded to put up the stovepipe.Smith pushed the knee
into the chimney, and Mr.The
next thing was to get the two pieces to come together.They pushed and
pulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their
hands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.Smith that a hammer was just the thing that
was needed, and he went for one.Brown improved the opportunity to
wipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact
that he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes
done in stove blacking.The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that
was needed, after all.Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of
the stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became
exasperated and threw away the hammer.Brown's toe, and
that worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated.Smith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr.Smith, after making a
great deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,
that he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and
that the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking
intently the other way.It came to pass in the course of the winter
that the pipe needed cleaning out.Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for
her own sake and her husband's.It happened that the kitchen was presided
over by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.This divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr.Smith's help in
cleaning out the pipe, and Mrs.Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.They carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a
horizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into
the yard.After they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to
put it up.That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it
steadily refused to go together.Smith and her housemaid
were sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore
they did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an
exceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation.The girl went for a
hammer, and brought also a bit of board.She placed this on the top of the
pipe, raised her hammer, Mrs.Smith held the pipe in place below, two
slight raps, and, lo, it was done.This story is true, with the exception of the
names and a few other unimportant items.I say, and will maintain it, that
as a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity
than a man.I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N.In the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor
Brown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an
Arabian writer:

"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast
forest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there.'It is
indeed an old place,' replied he.'We know it has stood there for 100 years
as the hunting home of the great St.John, but how long previous to that
we do not know.'"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy
little city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for
distant lands.On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had
flourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what
has gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and
wonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the
inhabitants how long it had been founded.'It is indeed a mighty city,'
replied he.'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there
on this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much
greater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air
was pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,
was covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and
sheep.I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the
sea-shore, how long ago this change took place?'In sooth, a strange
question!''This ground and city have never been different
from what you now behold them.''Were there not of old,' said I,'many
great manufacturers in this city?''Never,' answered he,'so far as we
have seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built
across the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,
and no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings."The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched
far into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with
many mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could
not be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof."Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not
perceive the slightest vestige of the city.I inquired of a very old and
saintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone
upon the spot, how long it had been destroyed.'Is this a question,' said
he, 'from a man like you?Know ye not that cities are not now part of the
human economy?Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,
and lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of
the sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be
best for them.In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse
nor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers
of any more value in growing the crops of the field.Electricity is
carried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when
the inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down
from the heavens by similar means.The influence of electricity has
destroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and
beasts, and every living thing upon the earth.All things have changed,
and what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting
place of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'"Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly
way, "it's a perfect shame, Mr.G., that you never bring me home anything
to read!I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.""I think so, too," responded the unfeeling man.Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to
swallow, to stop its noise, "have magazines till they can't rest.""Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of
news in that!"and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor."I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates," said the
miserable man.Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a
whole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud
enough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.Mouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.The following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of

  With sky-blue ribbons to knot them together;

  The tip of the plume right artfully twining
  Where a firm neck steals under the lining;
  And the curls and braids, the plume and the laces.Circle about the shyest of faces,

  LITTLE DILLY-DALLY.I don't believe you ever
   Knew any one so silly
  As the girl I'm going to tell about--
   A little girl named Dilly,
     Dilly-dally Dilly,
      Oh, she is very slow,
     She drags her feet
     Along the street,
      And dilly-dallies so!She's always late to breakfast
   Without a bit of reason,
  For Bridget rings and rings the bell
   And wakes her up in season.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      How can you be so slow?Why don't you try
     To be more spry,
      And not dilly-dally so?'Tis just the same at evening;
   And it's really quite distressing
  To see the time that Dilly wastes
   In dreaming and undressing.Dilly-dally Dilly
      Is always in a huff;
     If you hurry her
     Or worry her
      She says, "There's time enough."Since she's neither sick nor helpless,
   It is quite a serious matter
  That she should be so lazy that
   We still keep scolding at her.Dilly-dally Dilly,
      It's very wrong you know,
     To do no work
     That you can shirk,
      And dilly-dally so.Old "Uncle Jim," of Stonington, Conn., ought to have a whole drawer to
himself, for nothing short of it could express the easy-going enlargement
of his mind in narratives.Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,
and whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition
and genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his
statements and the truthful candor of his narrations.It happened that one
of the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was
interested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the
alleged gigantic stature of the race.A scientific friend, who knew the
Stonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get
valuable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all
the region about Cape Horn.And the Professor, without any hint about
Uncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the
visit.Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like
the following ethnological conversation ensued:

Professor--They tell me, Capt.Pennington, that you have been a good deal
in Patagonia.Uncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.Professor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and
their habits?Uncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir.Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of
'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.Professor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the
Patagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?Uncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest
tone of indifference--no, sir, they are not.(It was quite probable that
the Captain never had heard the suggestion before).The height of the
Patagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.Professor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?Uncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em.One day when the mate and I
were ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate
and I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet
nine inches and a half--that's their exact height.But, Captain, don't you suppose there
were giants there long ago, in the former generations?Uncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word.I'd heard that
story and I thought I'd settle it.I satisfied myself there was nothing in
it.Professor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants?Mightn't the former race have been giants?Uncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.Uncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual
moderation.The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and
went ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em.They all
measured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in
'em--men, women, and all ages just the same.Five feet nine inches and a
half is the natural height of a Patagonian.Not a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's
Magazine_."Nice child, very nice child," observed an old gentleman, crossing the
aisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye
with a wad of paper."None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger."Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with
pride.shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit."I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly."If you had given me
three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have
struck on.Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't
you?"squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment."See me take
that old fellow over there!""Try it on the old woman I
was sitting with.She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.""Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?"Johnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's
nose.But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the
small boy like a blizzard.She put him over the line, reversed him, ran
him backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally
dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof
the purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive."She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the gentleman, softly."She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of
truants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was
mistaken."And the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.The discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and
the register of the progress of our race.The oldest abecedarium in
existence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found
on the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central
Italy, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The
Phoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred
inscriptions.The "Moabite Stone" has yielded the honor of being the most
ancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in
1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the
earliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet.The lions of Nineveh
and an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early
alphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and
Nineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch
of the Phoenician alphabet.For the second period, a sarcophagus found in
1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of
more than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the
literature connected with it is overwhelming.An unbroken series of coins
extending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew
engraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,
early Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose
successive progress is fully detailed by Taylor.The Aramaean alphabet
lived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of
five great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the
East.Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of
the social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.Loans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the
development of the alphabet.The early Egyptian inscriptions show which
alphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes.Fragments on stone preserved in
old Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply
early alphabets.Alphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by
missionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of
persecution and perversion.The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after
the great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion
of Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are
astonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,
and that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.Greece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about
half a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local
features, and also by political connection.Of the oldest "a, b, c's" found in Italy, several were scribbled by
school-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;
others were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their
graves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary
slabs.The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware
with an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the
Greek alphabet twice repeated."Pa, I have signed the pledge," said a little boy to his father, on coming
home one evening; "will you help me keep it?""Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?"What could I do when my brother-officers
called--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?""Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?""You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch
it."Some weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening."Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?""No," said he; "I have not, but I shall get some.Here, Willie, run to the
store, and tell them to send some bottles up."The boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go."Come, Willie; why, what's the matter?He went, but came
back presently without any bottles."I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I
could not touch it.don't be angry; I told them to send it up,
but I could not touch it myself!"The father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:

"Gentlemen, do you hear that?When the ale comes
you may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not
another drop shall pass my lips.Willie, have you your temperance pledge?"And the boy was back with it in a moment.The father signed it and the
little fellow clung round his father's neck with delight.The ale came,
but not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.Children, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it.Don't
touch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.Stock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the

THE PRAIRIE FARMER is the Cheapest and Best Agricultural Paper published.He owned the farm--at least 'twas thought
   He owned, since he lived upon it,--
  And when he came there, with him brought
   The men whom he had hired to run it.He had been bred to city life
   And had acquired a little money;
  But, strange conceit, himself and wife
   Thought farming must be something funny.He did not work himself at all,
   But spent his time in recreation--
  In pitching quoits and playing ball,
   And such mild forms of dissipation.He kept his "rods" and trolling spoons,
   His guns and dogs of various habits,--
  While in the fall he hunted <DW53>s,
   And in the winter skunks and rabbits.His hired help were quick to learn
   The liberties that might be taken,
  And through the season scarce would earn
   The salt it took to save their bacon.He knew no more than child unborn,
   One-half the time, what they were doing,--
  Whether they stuck to hoeing corn,
   Or had on hand some mischief brewing.His crops, although they were but few,
   With proper food were seldom nourished,
  While cockle instead of barley grew,
   And noxious weeds and thistles flourished.His cows in spring looked more like rails
   Set up on legs, than living cattle;
  And when they switched their dried-up tails
   The very bones in them would rattle.At length the sheriff came along,
   Who soon relieved him of his labors.While he became the jest and song
   Of his more enterprising neighbors.Back to the place where life began,
   Back to the home from whence he wandered,
  A sadder, if not a wiser man,
   He went with all his money squandered.On any soil, be it loam or clay,
   Mellow and light, or rough and stony,

   Find use for brains as well as money._--Tribune and Farmer._


FRANK DOBB'S WIVES."The great trouble with my son," old Dobb observed to me once, "is that he
is a genius."And the old gentleman sighed and looked with melancholy eyes at the
picture on the genius's easel.It was a clever picture, but everything
Frank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing.Clever
was the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none.He
had begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out
of any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the
mysteries of notes.He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and
could not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,
and all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were
proportionately shallow and incomplete.Paternal partiality laid it to his
being too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of
consanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.Frank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world.You
never saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits.He painted a little,
thrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,
smoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same
deliberate and easy-going way.Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him
from serious work.So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior
to pay the bills.He had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's
heroes to luxuriate in.If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings
could have made a painter of him he would have been a master.The fame of
his studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures
sell.He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be
asked to call on him.He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and
was accorded a romantic eminence accordingly.So, with his pictures to
provide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived
the life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically
despised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who
envied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by
most of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.Frank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of
his own affairs.She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had
made when she visited his studio with a party of friends.She had not a
penny, but he made a draft upon "the governor," as he called him, and the
happy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe.They were absent six
months, during which time he did not set brush to canvas.Then they
returned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.He commenced the old life as if he had never been married.The familiar
sound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young
ladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was
traveled as if there had been no Mrs.Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb
provided.Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been
in his bachelor days.As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs.Dobb
had a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her.She rarely came to her
husband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of
business.He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the
strain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible.In
brief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman
lived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as
nearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a
trip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock
Exchange.He had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a
marine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to
paint.When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he
would move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art.He
did so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and
not putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the
steamer and in Havana has long since proved.His son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart.A little,
mild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in
his own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his
son till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of
it.The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law.In
proportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had
lost his affection for his son.I hear that there was a terrible scene
when Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried.He claimed to
have missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but
Munnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in
time for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he
had a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old
Dobb had heard of it.Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,
speaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as
"that infernal bloodless cad."However, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,
and Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and
been quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that
night in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat.When he emigrated, with
his studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys
bothered to see him off.They had learned to see through his good
fellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and
happiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.About a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of
the marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular
in society.I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,
and being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them."Well," remarked Smith, "that's really queer.You remember Frank left some
things in my care when he went away?Yesterday I got a letter asking about
them, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home."He did come home, and he settled in his old studio.What sort of a meeting
he had with his father this time I never heard.The old gentleman had been
paying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he
kept up the payment still.But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he
ever needed help he did now.His wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll.She had been an
heiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property
confiscated.Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the
culmination of this catastrophe.In fact, he had been paying court to her
with the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had
married her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave
he had sent it to.In marrying her he had evidently believed he was
establishing his future.So he was, but it was a future of expiation for
the sins and omissions of his past.Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy.She was
childish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist.She
measured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch
perpetually for trespassers on her domain.The domestic outbreaks between
the two were positively blood curdling.One afternoon, I remember, Gillian
Trussell, who had heard of his return, called on him.D. met her at
the studio door, told her, "Frank," as she called him, was out; slammed
the door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper.We had
to break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and
she frothing in a mad fit of hysterics.From that day he was a changed
man.The life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable.He
had lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to
the cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all.The
paternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and
they went into a boarding house.Inside of a month they were in the
papers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs.Dobb's part against one of the
ladies of the house.A couple of days after he leased a little room
opening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled
there for good.Such a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce.The studio had
long since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over
it along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs.D., like all
other creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was
half-named from.Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,
littered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the
caterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the
dirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them.Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and
wanted me for a <DW12>.But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke
out over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast
at a chop house.All of his old flirtations came back to curse him now.His light loves of
the playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the
instruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him.The very
names of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women
possess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a
frenzy.She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre
without bringing a quarrel home with them.If he was silent at the play
she charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,
her jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he
strove to interest her with.A word to a passing friend, a glance at one
of her own sex, was sufficient to set her going.I shall never question
that jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the
lives of that miserable man and woman.A year after his return he was the ghost of his old self.He was haggard
and often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had
lost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his
head and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility.The
fear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which
hung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too.Dobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was
smoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room.We
could distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.Smith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders.The disturbance
ceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.Then came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet.We
ran to the door, in time to see Mrs.Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her
back, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs.We
posted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of
the slippers which she had shed as she ran.The theatres were just out and
the streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad
woman that she was.We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who
was walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures.She seized
him by the arm and screamed out:

"I told you I would come with you."His face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair.I
saw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell.But he
slipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and
said, shrugging his shoulders, "You see how it is, Mac?"McGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and
scorn.We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off
together, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world
staring at them.Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night."I
couldn't get a wink up there," he said, "and I don't want to be even the
ear witness of a murder."The night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though.Next day,
Frank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months.He
was the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could
scarcely speak intelligibly."I saw you in the crowd last night, old man," he said, looking at the
floor and twisting and untwisting his fingers.A
nice life for a fellow to lead, eh?"What else could I reply than, "Why do you lead it then?"he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh."Why, because I
love her, damn me!"Is this what you came to tell me?""No," he answered, "of course not.The fact is, I want you to help me out
of a hole.That row last night has settled me with McGilp.He came to see
me about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the
senora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we
should go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there.She
swore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did.I thought
she'd not go that far; but she did.So the McGilp affair is off for good,
I know.He's disgusted, and I don't blame him.Buy that Hoguet you wanted last year."The picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy
days, one that he had picked up abroad.I was only too glad to take it and
a couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,
I heard that he had levanted."Walked out this morning," said Smith, "and
sent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the
city.She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the
other.She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going
to have her life, if she has to follow her around the world."She did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though.There were some
consultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again.Some one
told me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the
allowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now
continued to her.I had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the
Academy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan.She was promenading on
the arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to
me as her husband.I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the
introduction as information that there had been one.The Englishman was a
better fellow than he looked.We supped together after the opera, and I
learned that he had met Mrs.Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years
in business.I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I
only now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and
foolish self.She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a
sensible and clever woman.The influence of an intelligent man, who was
strong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness
and taught her to respect herself as well as him.I met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she
spoke of Frank for the first time.Her black eyes snapped when she uttered
his name.The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.I told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance."But I have," she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.she went on bitterly; "and to think I could ever have loved
such a thing as he!X., that I never knew he had been
married till after he had fled?Then his father told me how he had courted
my father's money, with his wife lying dead at home.Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had
stolen you from me.The moment after I could have struck you dead at my
feet."She threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger.I believed her, and
so would any one who had seen her then."I had hardly settled in Havana," she continued, "before I received a
letter from him.Had the other woman
tired of him already?I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father
had told me, that he had fled alone?I answered the letter, and he wrote
again.Again I answered, and so it was kept up.For two years I played
with the love I now knew was worthless.He was traveling round the world,
and a dozen times wanted to come directly to me.I insisted that he should
keep his journey up--as a probation, you see.The exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish.I could
see in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of
vengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which
she had raised, and into which she had plunged him.I could see him
wandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and
maddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable
pledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be
fulfilled.She read the expression of my face, and laughed.And again she stabbed the air with her fan."But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence," I said."I had been divorced while I was writing to him.A year ago he was to be
in London, where I was to meet him.While he was sailing from the Cape of
Good Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to
whom I had confided all.Instead of my address at the London post office
he received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand
and mailed to him by myself.He wrote once or twice still, but my husband
indorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened.He may
be dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will
remain alive and love me for a thousand years."She opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked
at me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire.No
wonder the wretched vagabond loved her!What a doom his selfishness and
his duplicity had invoked upon him!I believe if he could have seen her as
I saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he
would have gone mad on the spot.Dobb the first was indeed
avenged.We sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as
Frank Dobb had never been.Her husband joined us and we made an evening of
it at the theatre.I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the
increased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's
having made a confidant of me.But I do not think he knew how far her
confidence had gone.I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and
fierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was.There are things
women will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to
those they love.I saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in
London, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since.But some
months after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has
been painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the
Salon of '7--."I have odd news for you," he wrote."You remember Frank Dobb, who
belonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban
wife of his just before I left home?Well, about a year ago I met him in
Fleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw.He was quite tight and
smelled of gin across the street.He was taking a couple of drawings to a
penny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a
piece.I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.He was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of
all the holes you ever saw his was it.I soon had to sit down on him, for
he got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the
studio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.I heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which
this from the Telegraph will explain."The following newspaper paragraph was appended:

"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr.Bennerley Green, the
West India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American
who for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower
order of publications here.He was known as Allan, but this is said to
have been an assumed name.He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New
Yorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and
to have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United
States.All that is known of the suicide is the story told by the servant,
who a few minutes after admitting his master and mistress upon their
return from the theatre, heard the report of a pistol in the street, and
on opening the door found the wretched man dead upon the step.The body
was buried after the inquest at the charge of the eminent American artist,
Mr.J. J. Robinson, A. R. A., who had known him in his better days."Bennerley Green, the West

but after an hour came back with a broken bill and three claws gone, put
down the hen and took an old rubber boot in place of it.Alexander Gumbleton Ruffleton Scufflton Oborda Whittleton Sothenhall
Benjaman Franklin Squires is still a resident of North Carolina, aged
ninety-two.The census taker always thinks at first that the old man is
guying.A little five-year-old friend, who was always allowed to choose the
prettiest kitten for his pet and playmate before the other nurslings were
drowned, was taken to his mother's sick room the other morning to see the
two tiny new twin babes.He looked reflectively from one to the other for
a minute or two, then, poking his chubby finger into the plumpest baby, he
said decidedly, "Save this one."In promulgating your esoteric cogitation on articulating superficial
sentimentalities and philosophical psychological observation, beware of
platitudinous ponderosity.Let your conversation possess a clarified
conciseness, compact comprehensiveness, coalescent consistency, and a
concatenated cognancy; eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity
and jejune babblement.In other words, don't use such big words.A boy once took it in his head
  That he would exercise his sled.He took the sled into the road
  And, lord a massy!And as he slid, he laughing cried,
  "What fun upon my sled to slide."And as he laughed, before he knewed,
  He from that sliding sled was slude.Upon the slab where he was laid
  They carved this line: "This boy was sleighed.""A Farmer's Wife" wants to know if we can recommend anything to destroy
the "common grub."We guess the next tramp that comes along could oblige
you.MISCELLANEOUS

FIFE WHEAT

It is the best wheat I ever raised or saw.I sowed one quart and got from
it three bushels of beautiful wheat weighing 63 pounds to the bushel,
which took the first premium at our county fair.I have been offered $15 a
bushel for my seed, but would not part with a handful of it.If I could
not get more like it, I would not sell the three bushels I raised from the
quart for $100.STEABNER, Sorlien's Mill, Yellow Medicine Co., Minn.Farmers, if you want to know more of this wheat, write to

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prairie Farmer, Vol.[Illustration: THE FONTAINE DE MEDICIS]

But you must see more of this vast garden of the Luxembourg to
appreciate truly its beauty and its charm.Filled with beautiful
sculpture in bronze and marble, with its musee of famous modern pictures
bought by the Government, with flower-beds brilliant in geraniums and
fragrant in roses, with the big basin spouting a jet of water in its
center, where the children sail their boats, and with that superb
"Fontaine de Medicis" at the end of a long, rectangular basin of
water--dark as some pool in a forest brook, the green vines trailing
about its sides, shaded by the rich foliage of the trees overhead.On the other side of the Luxembourg you will find a garden of roses,
with a rich bronze group of Greek runners in the center, and near it,
back of the long marble balustrade, a croquet ground--a favorite spot
for several veteran enthusiasts who play here regularly, surrounded for
hours by an interested crowd who applaud and cheer the participants in
this passe sport.This is another way of spending an afternoon at the sole cost of one's
leisure.Often at the Punch and Judy show near-by, you will see two old
gentlemen,--who may have watched this same Punch and Judy show when they
were youngsters,--and who have been sitting for half an hour, waiting
for the curtain of the miniature theater to rise.It is popular--this
small "Theatre Guignol," and the benches in front are filled with the
children of rich and poor, who scream with delight and kick their
little, fat bare legs at the first shrill squeak of Mr.The three
who compose the staff of this tiny attraction have been long in its
service--the old harpist, and the good wife of the showman who knows
every child in the neighborhood, and her husband who is Mr.Punch, the
hangman, and the gendarme, and half a dozen other equally historical
personages.A thin, sad-looking man, this husband, gray-haired, with a
careworn look in his deep-sunken eyes, who works harder hourly, daily,
yearly, to amuse the heart of a child than almost any one I know.The little box of a theater is stifling hot in summer, and yet he must
laugh and scream and sing within it, while his good wife collects the
sous, talking all the while to this and to that child whom she has known
since its babyhood; chatting with the nurses decked out in their
gay-colored, Alsatian bows, the ribbons reaching nearly to the ground.A French nurse is a gorgeous spectacle of neatness and cleanliness, and
many of the younger ones, fresh from country homes in Normandy and
Brittany, with their rosy cheeks, are pictures of health.Wherever you
see a nurse, you will see a "piou-piou" not far away, which is a very
belittling word for the red-trousered infantryman of the Republique
Francaise.Surrounding the Palais du Luxembourg, these "piou-pious," less fortunate
for the hour, stand guard in the small striped sentry-boxes, musket at
side, or pace stolidly up and down the flagged walk.Marie, at the
moment, is no doubt with the children of the rich Count, in a shady spot
near the music.How cruel is the fate of many a gallant "piou-piou"!Farther down the gravel-walk strolls a young Frenchman and his
fiancee--the mother of his betrothed inevitably at her side!It is under
this system of rigid chaperonage that the young girl of France is given
in marriage.It is not to be wondered at that many of them marry to be
free, and that many of the happier marriages have begun with an
elopement![Illustration: THE PALACE OF THE LUXEMBOURG]

The music is over, and the band is filing out, followed by the crowd.A
few linger about the walks around the band-stand to chat.The old lady
who rents the chairs is stacking them up about the tree-trunks, and long
shadows across the walks tell of the approaching twilight.Overhead,
among the leaves, the pigeons coo.For a few moments the sun bathes
the great garden in a pinkish glow, then drops slowly, a blood-red disk,
behind the trees.The air grows chilly; it is again the hour to
dine--the hour when Paris wakes.In the smaller restaurants of the Quarter one often sees some strange
contrasts among these true bohemians, for the Latin Quarter draws its
habitues from every part of the globe.They are not all French--these
happy-go-lucky fellows, who live for the day and let the morrow slide.You will see many Japanese--some of them painters--many of them taking
courses in political economy, or in law; many of them titled men of high
rank in their own country, studying in the schools, and learning, too,
with that thoroughness and rapidity which are ever characteristic of
their race.You will find, too, Brazilians; gentlemen from Haiti of
darker hue; Russians, Poles, and Spaniards--men and women from every
clime and every station in life.They adapt themselves to the Quarter
and become a part of this big family of Bohemia easily and naturally.In this daily atmosphere only the girl-student from our own shores seems
out of place.She will hunt for some small restaurant, sacred in its
exclusiveness and known only to a dozen bon camarades of the Quarter.Perhaps this girl-student, it may be, from the West and her cousin from
the East will discover some such cosy little boite on their way back
from their atelier.To two other equally adventurous female minds they
will impart this newest find; after that you will see the four dining
there nightly together, as safe, I assure you, within these walls of
Bohemia as they would be at home rocking on their Aunt Mary's porch.There is, of course, considerable awkwardness between these bon
camarades, to whom the place really belongs, and these very innocent
new-comers, who seek a table by themselves in a corner under the few
trees in front of the small restaurant.And yet every one is exceedingly
polite to them.Madame the patronne hustles about to see that the dinner
is warm and nicely served; and Henriette, who is waiting on them, none
the less attentive, although she is late for her own dinner, which she
will sit down to presently with madame the patronne, the good cook, and
the other girls who serve the small tables.[Illustration: WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE THEATERS]

This later feast will be augmented perhaps by half the good boys and
girls who have been dining at the long table.Perhaps they will all come
in and help shell the peas for to-morrow's dinner.And yet this is a
public place, where the painters come, and where one pays only for what
one orders.It is all very interesting to the four American girls, who
are dining at the small table.But what must Mimi think of these silent and exclusive strangers, and
what, too, must the tall girl in the bicycle bloomers think, and the
little girl who has been ill and who at the moment is dining with
Renould, the artist, and whom every one--even to the cook, is so glad to
welcome back after her long illness?There is an unsurmountable barrier
between the Americans at the little table in the corner and that jolly
crowd of good and kindly people at the long one, for Mimi and Henriette
and the little girl who has been so ill, and the French painters and
sculptors with them, cannot understand either the language of these
strangers or their views of life.exclaims one of the strangers in a whisper, "do look at that
queer little 'type' at the long table--the tall girl in black actually
kissed him!"Why, my dear, I saw it plainly!"There is no law against kissing in the open air in Paris,
and besides, the tall girl in black has known the little "type" for a
Parisienne age--thirty days or less.The four innocents, who have coughed through their soup and whispered
through the rest of the dinner, have now finished and are leaving, but
if those at the long table notice their departure, they do not show it.In the Quarter it is considered the height of rudeness to stare.You
will find these Suzannes and Marcelles exceedingly well-bred in the
little refinements of life, and you will note a certain innate dignity
and kindliness in their bearing toward others, which often makes one
wish to uncover his head in their presence.CHAPTER IX

"THE RAGGED EDGE OF THE QUARTER"


There are many streets of the Quarter as quiet as those of a country
village.Some of them, like the rue Vaugirard, lead out past gloomy
slaughter-houses and stables, through desolate sections of vacant
lots, littered with the ruins of factory and foundry whose tall,
smoke-begrimed chimneys in the dark stand like giant sentries, as if
pointing a warning finger to the approaching pedestrian, for these
ragged edges of the Quarter often afford at night a lurking-ground for
footpads.In just such desolation there lived a dozen students, in a small nest of
studios that I need not say were rented to them at a price within their
ever-scanty means.It was marveled at among the boys in the Quarter that
any of these exiles lived to see the light of another day, after
wandering back at all hours of the night to their stronghold.Possibly their sole possessions consisted of the clothes they had on, a
few bad pictures, and their several immortal geniuses.That the
gentlemen with the sand-bags knew of this I am convinced, for the
students were never molested.Verily, Providence lends a strong and
ready arm to the drunken man and the fool!The farther out one goes on the rue Vaugirard, the more desolate
and forbidding becomes this long highway, until it terminates at
the fortifications, near which is a huge, open field, kept clear
of such permanent buildings as might shelter an enemy in time of
war.Scattered over this space are the hovels of squatters and
gipsies--fortune-telling, horse-trading vagabonds, whose living-vans
at certain times of the year form part of the smaller fairs within
the Quarter.[Illustration: (factory chimneys along empty street)]

And very small and unattractive little fairs they are, consisting of
half a dozen or more wagons, serving as a yearly abode for these
shiftless people; illumined at night by the glare of smoking oil
torches.There is, moreover, a dingy tent with a half-drawn red curtain
that hides the fortune-telling beauty; and a traveling shooting-gallery,
so short that the muzzle of one's rifle nearly rests upon the painted
lady with the sheet-iron breastbone, centered by a pinhead of a
bull's-eye which never rings.There is often a small carousel, too,
which is not only patronized by the children, but often by a crowd of
students--boys and girls, who literally turn the merry-go-round into a
circus, and who for the time are cheered to feats of bareback riding by
the enthusiastic bystanders.These little Quarter fetes are far different from the great fete de
Neuilly across the Seine, which begins at the Porte Maillot, and
continues in a long, glittering avenue of side-shows, with mammoth
carousels, bizarre in looking-glass panels and golden figures.Within
the circle of all this throne-like gorgeousness, a horse-power organ
shakes the very ground with its clarion blasts, while pink and white
wooden pigs, their tails tied up in bows of colored ribbons, heave and
swoop round and round, their backs loaded with screaming girls and
shouting men.It was near this very same Port Maillot, in a colossal theater, built
originally for the representation of one of the Kiralfy ballets, that a
fellow student and myself went over from the Quarter one night to "supe"
in a spectacular and melodramatic pantomime, entitled "Afrique a Paris."We were invited by the sole proprietor and manager of the show--an
old circus-man, and one of the shrewdest, most companionable, and
intelligent of men, who had traveled the world over.He spoke no
language but his own unadulterated American.This, with his dominant
personality, served him wherever fortune carried him!So, accepting his invitation to play alternately the dying soldier and
the pursuing cannibal under the scorching rays of a tropical limelight,
and with an old pair of trousers and a flannel shirt wrapped in a
newspaper, we presented ourselves at the appointed hour, at the edge of
the hostile country.[Illustration: (street scene)]

Here we found ourselves surrounded by a horde of savages who needed no
greasepaint to stain their ebony bodies, and many of whose grinning
countenances I had often recognized along our own Tenderloin.Besides,
there were cowboys and "greasers" and diving elks, and a company of
French Zouaves; the latter, in fact, seemed to be the only thing foreign
about the show.Our friend, the manager, informed us that he had thrown
the entire spectacle together in about ten days, and that he had
gathered with ease, in two, a hundred of those dusky warriors, who had
left their coat-room and barber-shop jobs in New York to find themselves
stranded in Paris.He was a hustler, this circus-man, and preceding the spectacle of the
African war, he had entertained the audience with a short variety-show,
to brace the spectacle.He insisted on bringing us around in front and
giving us a box, so we could see for ourselves how good it really was.During this forepart, and after some clever high trapeze work,
the sensation of the evening was announced--a Signore, with an
unpronounceable name, would train a den of ten forest-bred lions!When the orchestra had finished playing "The Awakening of the Lion," the
curtain rose, disclosing the nerveless Signore in purple tights and
high-topped boots.A long, portable cage had been put together on the
stage during the intermission, and within it the ten pacing beasts.There is something terrifying about the roar of a lion as it begins with
its high-keyed moan, and descends in scale to a hoarse roar that seems
to penetrate one's whole nervous system.But the Signore did not seem to mind it; he placed one foot on the sill
of the safety-door, tucked his short riding-whip under his arm, pulled
the latch with one hand, forced one knee in the slightly opened door,
and sprang into the cage.went the iron door as it found its
lock.went the Signore's revolver, as he drove the snarling,
roaring lot into the corner of the cage.The smoke from his revolver
drifted out through the bars; the house was silent.The trainer walked
slowly up to the fiercest lion, who reared against the bars as he
approached him, striking at the trainer with his heavy paws, while the
others slunk into the opposite corner.The man's head was but half a
foot now from the lion's; he menaced the beast with the little
riding-whip; he almost, but did not quite strike him on the tip of his
black nose that worked convulsively in rage.Then the lion dropped
awkwardly, with a short growl, to his forelegs, and slunk, with the
rest, into the corner.It was the little
riding-whip they feared, for they had never gauged its sting.Not the
heavy iron bar within reach of his hand, whose force they knew."An ugly lot," I said, turning to our friend the manager, who had taken
his seat beside me."Yes," he mused, peering at the stage with his keen gray eyes; "green
stock, but a swell act, eh?I've got a
girl here who comes on and does art poses among the lions; she's a
dream--French, too!"A girl of perhaps twenty, enveloped in a bath gown, now appeared at the
wings.The next instant the huge theater became dark, and she stood in
full fleshings, in the center of the cage, brilliant in the rays of a
powerful limelight, while the lions circled about her at the command of
the trainer."Yes," said I, "she is.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

"No, she never worked with the cats before," he said; "she's new to the
show business; she said her folks live in Nantes.She worked here in a
chocolate factory until she saw my 'ad' last week and joined my show.We
gave her a rehearsal Monday and we put her on the bill next night.She's
a good looker with plenty of grit, and is a winner with the bunch in
front.""How did you get her to take the job?""Well," he replied, "she balked at the act at first, but I showed her
two violet notes from a couple of swell fairies who wanted the job, and
after that she signed for six weeks."he exclaimed dryly, and he bit the corner of his stubby
mustache and smiled."This is the last act in the olio, so you will have
to excuse me.*     *     *     *     *

There are streets and boulevards in the Quarter, sections of which are
alive with the passing throng and the traffic of carts and omnibuses.Then one will come to a long stretch of massive buildings, public
institutions, silent as convents--their interminable walls flanking
garden or court.Germain is just such a highway until it crosses the
Boulevard St.Michel--the liveliest roadway of the Quarter.Then it
seems to become suddenly inoculated with its bustle and life, and from
there on is crowded with bourgeoise and animated with the commerce of
market and shop.An Englishman once was so fired with a desire to see the gay life of the
Latin Quarter that he rented a suite of rooms on this same Boulevard St.Germain at about the middle of this long, quiet stretch.Here he stayed
a fortnight, expecting daily to see from his "chambers" the gaiety of a
Bohemia of which he had so often heard.At the end of his disappointing
sojourn, he returned to London, firmly convinced that the gay life of
the Latin Quarter was a myth.[Illustration: (crowded street market)]

But the man from Denver, the "Steel King," and the two thinner
gentlemen with the louis-lined waistcoats who accompanied him and whom
Fortune had awakened in the far West one morning and had led them to
"The Great Red Star copper mine"--a find which had ever since been a
source of endless amusement to them--discovered the Quarter before they
had been in Paris a day, and found it, too, "the best ever," as they
expressed it.They did not remain long in Paris, this rare crowd of seasoned genials,
for it was their first trip abroad and they had to see Switzerland and
Vienna, and the Rhine; but while they stayed they had a good time Every
Minute.The man from Denver and the Steel King sat at one of the small tables,
leaning over the railing at the "Bal Bullier," gazing at the sea of
dancers."Billy," said the man from Denver to the Steel King, "if they had this
in Chicago they'd tear out the posts inside of fifteen minutes"--he
wiped the perspiration from his broad forehead and pushed his
twenty-dollar Panama on the back of his head.he mused, clinching the butt of his perfecto between
his teeth.it beats all I ever see," and he chuckled to
himself, his round, genial face, with its double chin, wreathed in
smiles.he called to one of the 'copper twins,' "did you get on
to that little one in black that just went by--well!Already the pile of saucers on their table reached a foot high--a record
of refreshments for every Yvonne and Marcelle that had stopped in
passing."Certainly, sit right down," cried the Steel King."Here, Jack,"--this
to the aged garcon, "smoke up!and ask the ladies what they'll
have"--all of which was unintelligible to the two little Parisiennes and
the garcon, but quite clear in meaning to all three.interrupted the taller of the two girls, "un cafe
glace pour moi.""Et moi," answered her companion gayly, "Je prends une limonade!"thundered good-humoredly the man from Denver; "git 'em
a good drink.yes, that's it--whiskey--I see you're on,
and two.he explains, holding up two fat fingers, "all straight,
friend--two whiskeys with seltzer on the side--see?Now go roll your
hoop and git back with 'em.""Oh, non, monsieur!"cried the two Parisiennes in one breath; "whiskey!ca pique et c'est trop fort."At this juncture the flower woman arrived with a basketful of red roses."Voulez-vous des fleurs, messieurs et mesdames?""Certainly," cried the Steel King; "here, Maud and Mamie, take the lot,"
and he handed the two girls the entire contents of the basket.The
taller buried her face for a moment in the red Jaqueminots and drank in
their fragrance.When she looked up, two big tears trickled down to the
corners of her pretty mouth.The
smaller girl gave a little cry of delight and shook her roses above her
head as three other girls passed.Ten minutes later the two possessed
but a single rose apiece--they had generously given all the rest away.[Illustration: (portrait of woman)]

The "copper twins" had been oblivious of all this.They had been hanging
over the low balustrade, engaged in a heart-to-heart talk with two
pretty Quartier brunettes.It seemed to be really a case of love at
first sight, carried on somewhat under difficulties, for the "copper
twins" could not speak a word of French, and the English of the two chic
brunettes was limited to "Oh, yes!""Good morning," "Good
evening," and "I love you."The four held hands over the low railing,
until the "copper twins" fairly steamed in talk; warmed by the sun of
gaiety and wet by several rounds of Highland dew, they grew sad and
earnest, and got up and stepped all over the Steel King and the man from
Denver, and the two Parisiennes' daintily slippered feet, in squeezing
out past the group of round tables back of the balustrade, and down on
to the polished floor--where they are speedily lost to view in the maze
of dancers, gliding into the whirl with the two brunettes.When the
waltz is over they stroll out with them into the garden, and order wine,
and talk of changing their steamer date.The good American, with his spotless collar and his well-cut clothes,
with his frankness and whole-souled generosity, is a study to the modern
grisette.He seems strangely attractive to her, in contrast with a
certain type of Frenchman, that is selfish, unfaithful, and mean--that
jealousy makes uncompanionable and sometimes cruel.She will tell you
that these pale, black-eyed, and black-bearded boulevardiers are all
alike--lazy and selfish; so unlike many of the sterling, good fellows of
the Quarter--Frenchmen of a different stamp, and there are many of
these--rare, good Bohemians, with hearts and natures as big as all
out-doors--"bons garcons," which is only another way of saying
"gentlemen."As you tramp along back to your quarters some rainy night you find many
of the streets leading from the boulevards silent and badly lighted,
except for some flickering lantern on the corner of a long block which
sends the shadows scurrying across your path.You pass a student perhaps
and a girl, hurrying home--a fiacre for a short distance is a luxury in
the Quarter.Now you hear the click-clock of an approaching cab, the
cocher half asleep on his box.The hood of the fiacre is up, sheltering
the two inside from the rain.As the voiture rumbles by near a
street-light, you catch a glimpse of a pink silk petticoat within and a
pair of dainty, white kid shoes--and the glint of an officer's sword.Farther on, you pass a silent gendarme muffled in his night cloak; a few
doors farther on in a small cafe, a bourgeois couple, who have arrived
on a late train no doubt to spend a month with relatives in Paris, are
having a warming tipple before proceeding farther in the drizzling rain.They have, of course, invited the cocher to drink with them.They have
brought all their pets and nearly all their household goods--two dogs,
three bird-cages, their tiny occupants protected from the damp air by
several folds of newspaper; a cat in a stout paper box with air holes,
and two trunks, well tied with rope.[Illustration: (street market)]

"Ah, yes, it has been a long journey!"Her husband
corroborates her, as they explain to the patronne of the cafe and to the
cocher that they left their village at midday.Anything over two hours
on the chemin-de-fer is considered a journey by these good French
people!As you continue on to your studio, you catch a glimpse of the lights of
the Boulevard Montparnasse.Next a cab with a green light rattles by;
then a ponderous two-wheeled cart lumbers along, piled high with red
carrots as neatly arranged as cigars in a box--the driver asleep on his
seat near his swinging lantern--and the big Normandy horses taking the
way.It is late, for these carts are on their route to the early morning
market--one of the great Halles.The tired waiters are putting up the
shutters of the smaller cafes and stacking up the chairs.Now a cock
crows lustily in some neighboring yard; the majority at least of the
Latin Quarter has turned in for the night.A moment later you reach your
gate, feel instinctively for your matches.In the darkness of the court
a friendly cat rubs her head contentedly against your leg.It is the
yellow one that sleeps in the furniture factory, and you pick her up and
carry her to your studio, where, a moment later, she is crunching
gratefully the remnant of the beau maquereau left from your
dejeuner--for charity begins at home.CHAPTER X

EXILED


Scores of men, celebrated in art and in literature, have, for a longer
or shorter period of their lives, been bohemians of the Latin Quarter.And yet these years spent in cafes and in studios have not turned them
out into the world a devil-me-care lot of dreamers.They have all
marched and sung along the "Boul' Miche"; danced at the "Bullier";
starved, struggled, and lived in the romance of its life.It has all
been a part of their education, and a very important part too, in the
development of their several geniuses, a development which in later life
has placed them at the head of their professions.These years of
camaraderie--of a life free from all conventionalities, in daily touch
with everything about them, and untrammeled by public censure or the
petty views of prudish or narrow minds, have left them free to cut a
straight swath merrily toward the goal of their ideals, surrounded all
the while by an atmosphere of art and good-fellowship that permeates the
very air they breathe.If a man can work at all, he can work here, for between the
working-hours he finds a life so charming, that once having lived
it he returns to it again and again, as to an old love.How many are the romances of this student Quarter!How many hearts have
been broken or made glad!How many brave spirits have suffered and
worked on and suffered again, and at last won fame!We who come with a fresh eye know nothing of all that has passed
within these quaint streets--only those who have lived in and through it
know its full story.[Illustration: THE MUSEE CLUNY]

Pochard has seen it; so has the little old woman who once danced at the
opera; so have old Bibi La Puree, and Alphonse, the gray-haired garcon,
and Mere Gaillard, the flower-woman.They have seen the gay boulevards
and the cafes and generations of grisettes, from the true grisette of
years gone by, in her dainty white cap and simple dress turned low at
the throat, to the tailor-made grisette of to-day.Yet the eyes of the little old woman still dance; they have not grown
tired of this ever-changing kaleidoscope of human nature, this paradise
of the free, where many would rather struggle on half starved than live
a life of luxury elsewhere.I knew one once who lived in an
air-castle of his own building--a tall, serious fellow, a sculptor, who
always went tramping about in a robe resembling a monk's cowl, with his
bare feet incased in coarse sandals; only his art redeemed these
eccentricities, for he produced in steel and ivory the most exquisite
statuettes.One at the Salon was the sensation of the day--a knight in
full armor, scarcely half a foot in height, holding in his arms a nymph
in flesh-tinted ivory, whose gentle face, upturned, gazed sweetly into
the stern features behind the uplifted vizor; and all so exquisitely
carved, so alive, so human, that one could almost feel the tender heart
of this fair lady beating against the cold steel breastplate.Another "bon garcon"--a painter whose enthusiasm for his art knew no
bounds--craved to produce a masterpiece.This dreamer could be seen
daily ferreting around the Quarter for a studio always bigger than the
one he had.At last he found one that exactly fitted the requirements of
his vivid imagination--a studio with a ceiling thirty feet high, with
windows like the scenic ones next to the stage entrances of the
theaters.Here at last he could give full play to his brush--no subject
seemed too big for him to tackle; he would move in a canvas as big as a
back flat to a third act, and commence on a "Fall of Babylon" or a
"Carnage of Rome" with a nerve that was sublime!The choking dust of the
arena--the insatiable fury of the tigers--the cowering of hundreds of
unfortunate captives--and the cruel multitude above, seated in the vast
circle of the hippodrome--all these did not daunt his zeal.Once he persuaded a venerable old abbe to pose for his portrait.The
old gentleman came patiently to his studio and posed for ten days, at
the end of which time the abbe gazed at the result and said things which
I dare not repeat--for our enthusiast had so far only painted his
clothes; the face was still in its primary drawing."The face I shall do in time," the enthusiast assured the reverend man
excitedly; "it is the effect of the rich color of your robe I wished to
get.And may I ask your holiness to be patient a day longer while I put
in your boots?""Does monsieur think I am not a
very busy man?"Then softening a little, he said, with a smile:

"I won't come any more, my friend.I'll send my boots around to-morrow
by my boy."But the longest red-letter day has its ending, and time and tide beckon
one with the brutality of an impatient jailer.On my studio table is a well-stuffed envelope containing the documents
relative to my impending exile--a stamped card of my identification,
bearing the number of my cell, a plan of the slave-ship, and six red
tags for my baggage.The three pretty daughters of old Pere Valois know of my approaching
departure, and say cheering things to me as I pass the concierge's
window.Pere Valois stands at the gate and stops me with: "Is it true, monsieur,
you are going Saturday?""Yes," I answer; "unfortunately, it is quite true."The old man sighs and replies: "I once had to leave Paris myself";
looking at me as if he were speaking to an old resident."My regiment
was ordered to the colonies.It was hard, monsieur, but I did my duty."The patron of the tobacco-shop,
and madame his good wife, and the wine merchant, and the baker along the
little street with its cobblestone-bed, have all wished me "bon voyage,"
accompanied with many handshakings.It is getting late and Pere Valois
has gone to hunt for a cab--a "galerie," as it is called, with a place
for trunks on top.Twenty minutes go by, but no "galerie" is in sight.The three daughters of Pere Valois run in different directions to find
one, while I throw the remaining odds and ends in the studio into my
valise.At last there is a sound of grating wheels below on the gravel
court.The "galerie" has arrived--with the smallest of the three
daughters inside, all out of breath from her run and terribly excited.There are the trunks and the valises and the bicycle in its crate to get
down.Two soldiers, who have been calling on two of the daughters, come
up to the studio and kindly offer their assistance.There is no time to
lose, and in single file the procession starts down the atelier stairs,
headed by Pere Valois, who has just returned from his fruitless search
considerably winded, and the three girls, the two red-trousered soldiers
and myself tugging away at the rest of the baggage.It is not often one departs with the assistance of three pretty femmes
de menage, a jolly old concierge, and a portion of the army of the
French Republic.With many suggestions from my good friends and an
assuring wave of the hand from the aged cocher, my luggage is roped and
chained to the top of the rickety, little old cab, which sways and
squeaks with the sudden weight, while the poor, small horse, upon whom
has been devolved the task of making the 11.35 train, Gare St.Lazare,
changes his position wearily from one leg to the other.He is evidently
thinking out the distance, and has decided upon his gait.cry the three girls and Pere Valois and the two soldiers,
as the last trunk is chained on.The dingy vehicle groans its way slowly out of the court.Just as it
reaches the last gate it stops.I ask, poking my head out of the window."Monsieur," says the aged cocher, "it is an impossibility!I regret very
much to say that your bicycle will not pass through the gate."A dozen heads in the windows above offer suggestions.I climb out and
take a look; there are at least four inches to spare on either side in
passing through the iron posts.cries my cocher enthusiastically, "monsieur is right, happily for
us!"He cracks his whip, the little horse gathers itself together--a moment
of careful driving and we are through and into the street and rumbling
away, amid cheers from the windows above.As I glance over my traps, I
see a small bunch of roses tucked in the corner of my roll of rugs with
an engraved card attached."From Mademoiselle Ernestine Valois," it
reads, and on the other side is written, in a small, fine hand, "Bon
voyage."I look back to bow my acknowledgment, but it is too late; we have turned
the corner and the rue Vaugirard is but a memory!*     *     *     *     *

But why go on telling you of what the little shops contain--how narrow
and picturesque are the small streets--how gay the boulevards--what they
do at the "Bullier"--or where they dine?It is Love that moves Paris--it
is the motive power of this big, beautiful, polished city--the love of
adventure, the love of intrigue, the love of being a bohemian if you
will--but it is Love all the same!"I work for love," hums the little couturiere."I work for love," cries the miller of Marcel Legay."I live for love," sings the poet."For the love of art I am a painter," sighs Edmond, in his atelier--"and
for her!""For the love of it I mold and model and create," chants the
sculptor--"and for her!"It is the Woman who dominates Paris--"Les petites femmes!"who have
inspired its art through the skill of these artisans.cries a poor old
woman outside of your train compartment, as you are leaving Havre for
Paris.screams a girl, running near the open window with a little
fishergirl doll uplifted.I see," cries the
pretty vendor; "but it is a boy doll--he will be sad if he goes to
Paris without a companion!"Take all the little fishergirls away from Paris--from the Quartier
Latin--and you would find chaos and a morgue!that is it--L'amour!--L'amour!--L'amour![Illustration: (burning candle)]

turned, and it made her nervous.She wanted to run away from him,
although there was no very definite reason why she should do so.As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,
education, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her
unusual personality.Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar
softness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity.There was
that about her which suggested the luxury of love.He felt as if
somehow she could be reached why, he could not have said.She did not
bear any outward marks of her previous experience.There were no
evidences of coquetry about her, but still he "felt that he might."He
was inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business
called him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland
for three weeks.Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she
experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret.He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to
Mrs.Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence
in Cleveland.As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as
if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,
at breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could
see the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at
odd times when he came to Mrs.Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things
over."Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?"Jennie heard
her say to him the second day he was there."I know," he replied, "but I'm in no mood for that.I want to
browse around a little while yet."You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.He has
got all he can attend to to look after the business."She scarcely understood what she
was thinking, but this man drew her.If she had realized in what way
she would have fled his presence then and there.Now he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed
an occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic
conversations.She could not help answering him--he was pleasing
to her.Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor
searching in a locker for some linen.Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other
servants being below stairs.On this occasion he made short work of
the business.He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
thoroughly determined way."I want to talk to you," he said."I--I--" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly."I live
out on Lorrie Street."he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell
him."Thirteen fourteen," she replied
mechanically.He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous
brown ones.A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed
between them."Oh, you mustn't," she said, her fingers going nervously to her
lips."I can't see you--I--I--"

"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I?Look here"--he took her arm and
drew her slightly closer--"you and I might as well understand
each other right now.She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,
with a growing terror."I don't know," she gasped, her lips dry.He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes."I'll talk to you later," he said,
and put his lips masterfully to hers.She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but
through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking
to her."We won't do any more of
this here, but, remember, you belong to me," he said, as he turned and
walked nonchalantly down the hall.Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
mistress's room and locked the door behind her.CHAPTER XVII


The shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she
was hours in recovering herself.At first she did not understand
clearly just what had happened.Out of clear sky, as it were, this
astonishing thing had taken place.she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness
there was an answer.Though she could not explain her own emotions,
she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.There is a fate in love and a fate in fight.This strong,
intellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,
so far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely
superior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,
instinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor
serving-maid.She was his natural affinity, though he did not know
it--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
nature.Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the
highly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the
proletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for
him the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of
judgment, youth, and beauty.Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in
the back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended
to take her.He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he
ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane.For purposes of
temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,
of course, out of the question.He had no idea of making anything like
a serious proposal to a servant-girl.He had
never seen a servant quite like her.And she was lady-like and lovely
without appearing to know it.Why
shouldn't he try to seize her?Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us
try to understand him and his position.Not every mind is to be
estimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to
be judged by the drag of a single passion.We live in an age in which
the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the
spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock.The tremendous and
complicated development of our material civilization, the
multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,
and sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,
and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in
short, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements
of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic
glitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies
and stultifies the mental and moral nature.It induces a sort of
intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of
insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited.Our modern
brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and
storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
themselves daily.We are
weighed upon by too many things.It is as if the wisdom of the
infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big
minds.Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.His was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and
tendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness
of the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial
nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.Born a
Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to
accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate
superiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and
expected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he
wanted marriage on any terms.Of course the conjugal state was an
institution.True, but other nations believed in
polygamy.There were other questions that bothered him--such
questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of
government were best.In short, the whole body of things material,
social, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery
and been left but half dissected.Not a
single idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was
finally settled.In all other things he wavered, questioned,
procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe
the solution of the problems that vexed him.Yes, Lester Kane was the
natural product of a combination of elements--religious,
commercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of
liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted
freedom of thought and action.Thirty-six years of age, and apparently
a man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,
nevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by
education and environment.Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
who in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the
mines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and
mortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,
axiomatic, and witty."Do you want me to come back here next year?"he had asked of
Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor."Your father will have to
look after that," he replied."Well, my father won't look after it," Lester returned."If you
touch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands.I'm not
committing any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked
around any more."Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,
vigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and
the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to
take his clothes and leave.After that he looked his father in the eye
and told him that he was not going to school any more."I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work," he explained."There's
nothing in a classical education for me.Let me go into the office,
and I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through."Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial
honor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce
him."Come down to the office," he said; "perhaps there is something you
can do."Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had
worked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had
come to be, in a way, his personal representative.Whenever there was
a contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a
deal, Lester was the agent selected.His father trusted him
implicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of
his duties that this trust had never been impaired."Business is business," was a favorite axiom with him and the very
tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character
and personality.There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and
then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under
control.One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was
perfectly sure he had the upper hand.He drank but very little, he
thought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.Another weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed
that he was the master.If he chose to have irregular relations with
women, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay.If men
were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such
relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences
growing out of them.Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp
upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a
quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a
little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual
conduct.Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to
be mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality
intact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it
was a good one.As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been
purely selfish.But now that he had asserted his masculine
prerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to
realize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.There is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin
to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal
of happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by
which they are environed.they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the
possibility of taking a maiden to wife, "that I shall be compelled to
swallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a
pledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my
affairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a
variable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become
insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty
and interest?"These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold
contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship.They
seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their
indulgence.Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional
relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of
radical readjustment.Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it.The
innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone.He wanted
the comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more
disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it.He
would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the
needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered.Of
course he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he
had discovered her.She appealed to him on every side; he had never
known anybody quite like her.Marriage was not only impossible but
unnecessary.He had only to say "Come" and she must obey; it was her
destiny.Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately.He strolled
out to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof
that sheltered her.Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment
touched his heart.Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,
honorably?Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him
and changed his mood.No, he must possess her if he
could--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible.It was in that frame
of mind that he returned to Mrs.Bracebridge's home from his visit to
Lorrie Street.CHAPTER XVIII


Jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
complicated problem to confront.Her baby, her father, her brothers,
and sisters all rose up to confront her.What was this thing that she
was doing?Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,
unsanctified relationship?How was she to explain to her family about
this man?He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about
her.He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and
position.Yet here she was parleying with him.She pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it
was best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him
where she lived.Then she resolved that she would summon up her
courage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have
anything to do with him.This last solution of the difficulty seemed
simple enough--in his absence.And she would find work where he
could not follow her up so easily.It all seemed simple enough as she
put on her things in the evening to go home.Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion
in this matter.Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to
the point.He came to the decision that he must act at once.She might
tell her family, she might tell Mrs.Bracebridge, she might leave the
city.He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,
and there was only one way to do that--talk to her.He must
persuade her to come and live with him.That soft, yielding note in her character
which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win
her without much difficulty, if he wished to try.He decided to do so,
anyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she
were still there.At six he had an opportunity to say to her,
unobserved, "I am going to walk home with you.Wait for me at the next
corner, will you?""Yes," she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing
her.She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,
that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
and this was as good an opportunity as any.At half-past six he left
the house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little
after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the
appointed spot.He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,
and curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior.It was as
if he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along.The flare of
the gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes
to make her out.A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a
great appeal in her personality.He stepped out as she neared the
corner and confronted her."Come," he said, "and get in this carriage
with me.Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of
compulsion.She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he
called out to the cabman, "Anywhere for a little while."When she was
seated beside him he began at once."Listen to me, Jennie, I want you."I have to talk to you," she replied, trying to stick to her
original line of defense.he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the
half light."I can't go on this way," she murmured nervously.I shouldn't have done what I did
this morning."You didn't do what you did this morning," he remarked,
paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.And as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.""You don't know me, but I like you.I'm crazy about you, that's
all.she replied in an agonized voice, "I can't do
anything like that, Mr.I couldn't, even if I wanted to.But I don't want to do anything wrong.He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with
even a little pity."What do you mean by you can't?""Oh, I can't tell you," she replied.But I mustn't see you any more."But you like me," he retorted.But you mustn't come near me
any more.He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a
judge.He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief
as their contact had been.And he was drawn to her, perhaps not
irrevocably, but with exceeding strength.What prevented her from
yielding, especially since she wanted to?"See here, Jennie," he replied.I don't know
what you mean by 'can't' if you want to.I'd like to have you
with me.Oh,
please don't ask me any more.The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play.Above all things
he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people.In this case he
intended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her."Listen to me," he said finally, still holding her hand."I may not
want you to do anything immediately.I
like you, and I can do a lot of things for you.Why not let us be good
friends now?Then we can talk the rest of this over later.""But I mustn't do anything wrong," she insisted."Oh no, no, no," she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her
control."Well, then, why stand out against me?I love you, I tell
you--I'm crazy about you.And I would have come again and again if necessary.I
tell you I'm crazy about you.Now tell me you'll
come with me.""No, no, no," she pleaded.I
don't want to do anything wrong."Tell me, Jennie," he said, changing the subject."Don't say'sir' to me, sweet!"I'm not'mister'
to you any more.You belong to me, little girl, me.""Listen to me, Jennie," he repeated, using his favorite expression.I
haven't had a chance to know you.You've
got to come to me eventually.And I'm not going to have you working as
a lady's maid.You can't stay in that place except for a little while.And I'm going to leave you some
money, do you hear?At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand."The families of the poor," he thought."Well, you take this from me," he insisted, drawing a purse from
his coat."And I'll see you very soon again.No, you mustn't
ask me."He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money
away."One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me," he said
soberly."You'll have to come to me eventually.I'm not going to leave you
alone.""Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.""I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?"he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of
this prize escaping him heightening his passion.And he drew her close in spite of all her protests."There," he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something
between them spoke again, and she relaxed.Tears were in her eyes, but
he did not see them."I can't," she repeated, with a sob."You're not crying, little girl,
are you?""I'll not say anything more to-night.I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you
again.I'll do anything
in reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?""Here's where you get out," he said, as the carriage drew up near
the corner.He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt
cottage curtains."Good-by," he said as she stepped out."Remember," he said, "this is just the beginning."Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed.There was no denying that she had compromised herself
irretrievably.CHAPTER XIX


The inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did
not leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;
certainly this was not the end of the affair.Kane knew that he was
deeply fascinated.She was sweeter than he had
had any idea of.Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle "no,
no, no" moved him as music might.Depend upon it, this girl was for
him, and he would get her.What did he
care about what his family or the world might think?It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time
Jennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done
spiritually.Something about her--a
warm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated
a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,
brutal immorality.She was the kind of a woman who was made for a
man--one man.All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
tenderness, service.When the one man arrived she would love him and
she would go to him.She would yield to him because he was the one man.On Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of
possible disaster.If he followed her of course he would learn all.She had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the
vague illusion that, in the end, she might escape.When she left him
she knew that he would come back.She knew, in spite of herself that
she wanted him to do so.Yet she felt that she must not yield, she
must go on leading her straitened, humdrum life.This was her
punishment for having made a mistake.She had made her bed, and she
must lie on it.The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned
after leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted
strangely with the Gerhardt home.It was a great, rambling, two-story
affair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick
and brownstone.It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost
park-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity
and of a refined luxury.Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a
tremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair
methods, but by seeing a big need and filling it.Early in life he had
realized that America was a growing country.There was going to be a
big demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he
knew that some one would have to supply them.Having founded a small
wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
wagons, and he sold them at a good profit.It was his theory that most
men were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,
and if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and
buy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man.He
believed in the measure "heaped full and running over."All through
his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of
every one who knew him."Archibald Kane," you would hear his
competitors say, "Ah, there is a fine man.This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all
healthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but
none of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and
big-hearted sire.Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was
his father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain
hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of
business life.He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with
a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue
eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips.He was a man of few
words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.He sat close to his
father as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole
blocks in an outlying section of the city.He was a strong man--a
coming man, as his father well knew.Lester, the second boy, was his father's favorite.He was not by
any means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of
the subtleties that underlie life.He was softer, more human, more
good-natured about everything.And, strangely enough, old Archibald
admired and trusted him.Perhaps he
turned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial
problem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the
mother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,
but as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the
best-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical.She
was the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of
all in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane
family should outshine every other.She was proud to think that the
family was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air
and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to
Lester!He liked her--in a way she was his favorite
sister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less
seriousness and not do the family standing any harm.Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of
age, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,
cared but little for social life.But she loved her children and her
husband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments.It
was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory.A good
woman, a good wife, and a good mother.Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at
once to his home.An old Irish servitor met him at the door.Lester," he began, joyously, "sure I'm glad to see you
back.Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're
having.Yes, yes, the family's all well.Sure your sister Amy is just
after leavin' the house with the boy.Your mother's up-stairs in her
room.Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room.In this,
which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the
south and east, sat Mrs.Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with
smoothly laid gray hair.She looked up when the door opened, laid down
the volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him."There you are, Mother," he said, putting his arms around her and
kissing her."Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester.I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again.I had
to stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons.She doesn't change any that I can see.She's just
as interested in entertaining as she ever was.""She's a bright girl," remarked his mother, recalling Mrs."She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you," replied Lester
significantly.Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family
happenings.Old Zwingle, the yard
watchman at the factory, who had been with Mr.Kane for over forty
years, had died.Lester listened
dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise."Smart" was
the word for her.She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,
fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which
contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair."Oh, there you are, Lester," she exclaimed.I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to
the powder on my nose.Lester had gripped her firmly
and kissed her soundly."I didn't brush much of it off," he said."You can always dust more
on with that puff of yours."He passed on to his own room to dress for
dinner.Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the
Kane family in the last few years.Guests had become so common that in
a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of
it.To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr.Burnett, old
friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be
a formal one.Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he
did not trouble to look him up now.He was thinking of his last two
days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.CHAPTER XX


As Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his
father in the library reading."Hello, Lester," he said, looking up from his paper over the top of
his glasses and extending his hand."Cleveland," replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
smiling."Robert tells me you've been to New York.""How did you find my old friend Arnold?""I suppose not," said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report
were a compliment to his own hardy condition."He's been a temperate
man.He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over
business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned
the guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great
Louis Quinze dining-room.He liked this homey home
atmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old
family friends.Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on
Tuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go."You know I don't dance," he returned dryly.If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you
might.""Robert's got it on me in lightness," Lester replied, airily."Be that as it may," said Lester."Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise," observed Robert,
sagely.After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with
his brother a little on business.There were some contracts coming up
for revision.He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.Louise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced."Letty Pace asked about you the other night," Louise called back
from the door."She's a nice girl, Lester," put in his father, who was standing
near the open fire."I only wish you would marry her and settle down.asked Lester jocularly--"a conspiracy?You
know I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.""And I well know it," replied his mother semi-seriously.He really could not stand for this sort
of thing any more, he told himself.And as he thought his mind
wandered back to Jennie and her peculiar "Oh no, no!"That was a type of womanhood worth
while.Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set
like a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little
girl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to
watch over her.That night in his room he composed a letter, which he
dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and
because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
weeks."MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said
nothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me.Was the impression
I gave of myself very bad?I will make it better from now on, for I
love you, little girl--I really do.There is a flower on my table
which reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.Your personality, lingering with me, is just that.You are the essence
of everything beautiful to me.It is in your power to strew flowers in
my path if you will."But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the
18th, and I shall expect to see you.I arrive Thursday night, and I
want you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon
Friday."You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call.These separations are dangerous to good
friendship.But I can't take "no" for an answer, not now."She's a remarkable girl in
her way," he thought.CHAPTER XXI


The arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and
after she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply.How did she truly feel about this
man?If she did so, what
should she say?Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which
she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,
had not seemed to involve any one but herself.Now, there seemed to be
others to consider--her family, above all, her child.The little
Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;
her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness
which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential
traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind.Gerhardt had
become very fond of her.Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct
feeling of kindliness toward her.And this readjustment of her
father's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct
herself that no pain should ever come to him again.Any new folly on
her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would
tend to injure the prospects of her little one.Her life was a
failure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do
nothing to spoil it.She wondered whether it would not be better to
write Lester and explain everything.She had told him that she did not
wish to do wrong.Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a
child, and beg him to leave her in peace.Did she really want him to take her at her word?The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.It caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to
explain, and then to tear it up.Finally, fate intervened in the
sudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an
accident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when
a letter came from Gerhardt.But instead of the customary fatherly
communication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly
remittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by
another hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received
a severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a
dipper of molten glass.The letter added that he would be home the
next morning.exclaimed William, his mouth wide
open.said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at
the floor.The possibility
that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties
which she had not the courage to contemplate.Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight.The former
heard the news with an astonished face."Did the letter say
how bad he was hurt?""Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Bass easily.I wouldn't worry like that if I
were you."The truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly
different.His brain was
not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of
things."I
can't help it, though.To think that just when we were getting along
fairly well this new calamity should be added.It seems sometimes as
if we were under a curse.When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was
her one stay.asked Jennie as she opened the door and
observed her mother's face.Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away."Pa's had his hands burned," put in Bass solemnly."He'll be home
to-morrow."Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.Instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her."Now, don't you cry, ma," she said, barely able to control herself.I know how you feel, but we'll get along.Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long
before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.And now without volition upon her part there leaped into her
consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought.What about Lester's
offer of assistance now?Somehow
it came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire
to help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when
Bass was in jail.She thought
this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,
haggard, and distraught."What a pity," she thought, "that her mother
must always suffer!Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any
real happiness?""I wouldn't feel so badly," she said, after a time."Maybe pa isn't
burned so badly as we think.Did the letter say he'd be home in the
morning?"They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details
were exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the
household."One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,"
said Jennie to Bass."No," said Bass gloomily, "you mustn't.He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;
he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in.Jennie and
her mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen
talking."I don't see what's to become of us now," said Mrs.Gerhardt at
last, completely overcome by the financial complications which this
new calamity had brought about.She looked so weak and helpless that
Jennie could hardly contain herself."Don't worry, mamma dear," she said, softly, a peculiar resolve
coming into her heart.There was comfort and ease
in it scattered by others with a lavish hand.Surely, surely
misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future
seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps."What do you suppose will become of us now?"repeated her mother,
who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
crumbled before her eyes."Why," said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,
"it will be all right.She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of
the situation to her.She must sacrifice herself; there was no other
way.Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning.He
looked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal.His cheeks
were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt.His
hands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a
picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home
from the station."By chops," he said to Bass, "that was a burn I got.I thought once
I couldn't stand the pain any longer.He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did
not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again.The
thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been
burned to the bone.The latter had been amputated at the first
joint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger
of being stiff.he added, "just at the time when I needed the money
most.Gerhardt opened the door, the
old mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.Even Bass lost control of himself for a
moment or two, but quickly recovered.The other children wept, until
Bass called a halt on all of them."Don't cry now," he said cheeringly.It
isn't so bad as all that.Bass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her
husband was home, Mrs.Though his
hands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not
otherwise injured was some consolation.He might recover the use of
his hands and be able to undertake light work again.Anyway, they
would hope for the best.When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father
and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but
she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.Never had he completely recovered from
the shame which his daughter had brought upon him.Although he wanted
to be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to
say or do."Papa," said Jennie, approaching him timidly.Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it
was unavailing.The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her
sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all
too much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly."Forgive me, papa," she pleaded, "I'm so sorry.He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that
their meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he
did."I have prayed," he said brokenly.When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.From that time, although there was always a great reserve between
them, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored
to show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old
days.But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares
and burdens to be faced.How were they to get along now with five
dollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's
presence added?Bass might have contributed more of his weekly
earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it.And so the small
sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which
now began to press very heavily.Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to
have his hands dressed daily.Either more money must come from some source or the family must beg
for credit and suffer the old tortures of want.The situation
crystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.Had he not tried to force money
on her?She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of
this proffered assistance.She sat down and wrote him a brief note.She would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come
to the house.She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled
feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the
fateful day.CHAPTER XXII


The fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new
and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence.There
was really no alternative, she thought.If she could make her family happy, if she could
give Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of
this older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,
perhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and
Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her.At seven o'clock she
went to Mrs.Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext
of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had
failed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out
of tune with the world.He had a lingering hope that a letter from
Jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from
her.He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt
depressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.After supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of
billiards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had
taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant.The
next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole
affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew
near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last
chance.Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of
an hour of the time, he went down into the parlor.Great was his
delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the
outcome of her acquiescence.He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
gratified smile on his face."So you did come after all," he said, gazing at her with the look
of one who has lost and recovered a prize."What do you mean by not
writing me?I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made
up your mind not to come at all."What's the
trouble, Jennie?Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?"Yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say."He burned his hands at the glass-works.It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
more."She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that
she was facing a crisis.I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
affairs ever since I left."He led the way into the dining-room and
selected a secluded table.He tried to divert her mind by asking her
to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so
and he had to make out the menu by himself.Then he turned to her with
a cheering air."Now, Jennie," he said, "I want you to tell me all
about your family.I got a little something of it last time, but I
want to get it straight.Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by
trade.Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.""He's a clerk in a cigar store.""I think it's twelve dollars," she replied thoughtfully."Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet.He gets three
dollars and a half."He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking
earnestly."To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like
that, Jennie," he said."I've been thinking about you a lot.There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad
one, if you'll only believe me."He paused for an inquiry, but she
made none."I thought I wouldn't," she said simply."I knew what you thought," he replied.I'm
going to 'tend to that family of yours.And I'll do it right now while
I think of it."He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar
bills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all."I want you to take
this," he said.I will see that your family
is provided for from now on.She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut
her fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time."I
want you to have it, sweet.I'm not going to
see you suffer, nor any one belonging to you."Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips."I don't know how to thank you," she said."You don't need to," he replied."The thanks are all the other
way--believe me."He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.She looked at the table, wondering what would come next."How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?""That would give you your freedom day times.""I couldn't do that," she replied."But there's so little in what
you're doing.I would be glad to
give you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which
you could use it."He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of
sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence
such as this.He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched
him."There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see," he went
on very gently."You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.Give it up and come with me down
to New York; I'll take good care of you.As
far as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them
any more.You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any
style you please.He paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,
her dear mother.Gerhardt had been talking of
this very thing--a nice home.If they could just have a larger
house, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she
would be.In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the
discomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would
be so happy.She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in
spirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion.It had been a
happy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the
family.He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:

"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?""It would be very nice," she said, "but it can't be done now.Papa would want to know all about where I was
going."Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with
Mrs."There couldn't be any objection to
that, could there?""Not if they didn't find out," she said, her eyes opening in
amazement.Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long
trips.Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to
go--and then go?"She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible.Then she
looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant
possible motherhood for her again.The tragedy of giving birth to a
child--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least
under the same conditions.She could not bring herself to tell him
about Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection."I--" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
and then stopping.He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.He reached over and laid his strong
brown one on top of it."I couldn't have a baby," she said, finally, and looked down.He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency
under conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of
the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she
had not occupied until that moment."You're a great girl, Jennie," he said.You don't need to have a
child unless you want to, and I don't want you to."He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.You think I know,
don't you?"But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.There wouldn't
be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time.But there won't be--don't worry."Not for worlds could she have met his
eyes."Look here, Jennie," he said, after a time."You care for me, don't
you?You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care
for you?I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth.I want you to do it
quickly.I know how difficult this family business is, but you can
arrange it.We'll pretend a courtship, anything you
like--only come now.""You don't mean right away, do you?"Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would
think anything about it."It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood," she replied
thoughtfully."I know it, but you can come."Won't you wait a little while?""Not a day, sweet, that I can help."Yes," she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of
affection.CHAPTER XXIII


The business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not
so difficult as it first appeared.Jennie proposed to tell her mother
the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except
that she was going with Mrs.He
might question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home
that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she
was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and
hat."When we get to New York I am
going to get you some real things," he told her."I am going to show
you what you can be made to look like."He had all the purchased
articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel.Then he arranged
to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in
the afternoon.Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received
her with her usual affectionate greeting."No," she said, "I'm not tired."Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma.She
paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.So many things had
happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new
calamity."You haven't lost your place, have you?""No," replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,
"but I'm going to leave it.""Why, when did you decide to do
that?""Yes, I do, mamma.I've got something I want to tell you.There isn't any way we can make things come
out right.I have found some one who wants to help us.He says he
loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.You wouldn't do
anything like that after all that's happened."I've thought it all out," went on Jennie, firmly.He
wants me to go with him, and I'd better go.He will take a new house
for us when we come back and help us to get along.No one will ever
have me as a wife--you know that."I thought I'd better not tell him
about her.She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.""I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie," said
her mother."Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?""I thought maybe that she could be kept here," suggested Jennie,
"until she's old enough to go to school.Then maybe I could send her
somewhere.""She might," assented her mother; "but don't you think it would be
better to tell him now?He won't think any the worse of you.""I don't want
her to be brought into it.""Oh, it's been almost two months now.""And you never said anything about him," protested Mrs."I didn't know that he cared for me this way," said Jennie
defensively."Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?"You can't go and not have
your father find out.""I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs.Papa can't
object to my going with her."Gerhardt, with her
imaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new
and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life.He was
wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home."And he gave me this," put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive
psychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood.She opened her
dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she
placed the money in her mother's hands.Here was the relief for all her
woes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small
package of green and yellow bills.If there were plenty of money in
the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and
Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for
Vesta."Do you think he might ever want to marry you?""I don't know," replied Jennie "he might."Well," said her mother after a long pause, "if you're going to
tell your father you'd better do it right away.He'll think it's
strange as it is."Her mother had acquiesced from
sheer force of circumstances.She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to
be for the best."I'll help you out with it," her mother had
concluded, with a little sigh.The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming
nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions.The children were
also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the
falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough."How long do you think you'll be gone?""About two or three weeks," she replied."That's a nice trip," he said."I came through New York in 1844.It
was a small place then compared to what it is now."Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,
going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her."So you came," he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the
ladies' parlor."You are my niece," he went on."I have engaged H room for you near
mine.I'll call for the key, and you go dress.When you're ready I'll
have the trunk sent to the depot.The train leaves at one
o'clock."She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,
smoked, and finally knocked at her door.She replied by opening to him, fully clad."You look charming," he said with a smile.She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught.The whole
process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had
been hard on her.He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down
the hall.He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these
simple clothes--the best she had ever had.They reached the depot after a short carriage ride.The
accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed
just enough time to make the train.When they settled themselves in a
Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his
part.He had succeeded in
what he had started out to do.As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the
fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully.There were the
forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains
of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,
their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and
yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain.Jennie noted
one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where
they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and began silently to cry."I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?"said

Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading."Come, come," he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her.You'll never get along if
you act that way."She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him
with strange sympathies."Don't cry," he continued soothingly; "everything will be all
right.Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her
eyes."You don't want to give way like that," he continued."It doesn't
do you any good.I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears
won't help it any.It isn't as if you were going away for good, you
know.You care for me, don't
you, sweet?"Yes," she said, and managed to smile back at him.Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking
of Vesta.It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret
from one who was already very dear to her.She knew that she ought to
tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful
necessity.Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it."I'll have to tell him something," she thought with a sudden
upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty."If I
don't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find
it out he would never forgive me.He might turn me out, and then where
would I go?She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror
sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving
soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and
comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an
avenging Nemesis.She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked
up."Well, have you washed all your sins away?"The touch of fact in it made it
slightly piquant.He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,
the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing
dwelling in her mind."I'll have to do it shortly," she thought, and
consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage
before long.Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important
question in Lester's mind as to where he should stop.New York was a
very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people
who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take
chances.Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more
exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and
they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,
so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same
world that she had inhabited before.Kane was no lover of vulgar
display.The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always
simple and elegant.He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought
for her with discrimination and care.And Jennie, a woman, took a keen
pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished
upon her.Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's
daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure
of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat
and upon her arms?Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?And Lester had promised
that her mother would share in it.Tears sprang to her eyes at the
thought.It was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
make her look like some one truly worthy of im.He exercised his most
careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself.People turned
in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at
Jennie."A stunning woman that man has with him," was a frequent
comment.Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life
or her sense of perspective or proportion.She felt as though life
were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after
a time.There was no pretty vanity in her bosom.Lester realized this
as he watched her."You're a big woman, in your way," he said.Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to
now."He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his
family, should they chance to hear about it.If he should decide to
take a home in Chicago or St.Louis (there was such a thought running
in his mind) could he maintain it secretly?He was
half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as
to her future course of action."You ought to find some way of
introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father," he said.Then if you tell him you're going
to marry me he'll think nothing of it."Jennie thought of Vesta, and
trembled inwardly.But perhaps her father could be induced to remain
silent.Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the
clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them
home when she reached there."There won't be any trouble about this
other stuff," he said."I'll have it cared for until we make some
other arrangement."It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
strategist.Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.She had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs.In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her
mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some
one who liked her.She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and
her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his
peace.Jennie must be given an opportunity
to better herself.Of
course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs.Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order
that she might look for something better, something at which he could
make more money.CHAPTER XXIV


The problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his
business duties.He was heartily interested in the immense plant,
which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its
conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as
to either his father or his brother.He liked to feel that he was a
vital part of this great and growing industry.When he saw freight
cars going by on the railroads labelled "The Kane Manufacturing
Company--Cincinnati" or chanced to notice displays of the
company's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the
different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction.It
was something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so
distinguished, so honestly worth while.This was all very well, but
now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal
existence--in a word, there was Jennie.He was conscious as he
rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which
might involve disagreeable consequences.He was a little afraid of his
father's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent
business man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private
life.Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,
he was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn
any trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,
recommended to his conscience.How he reasoned Lester did not
know--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which
could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow
his brother managed to do it."He's got a Scotch Presbyterian
conscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance."Lester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately
measured.Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his
positions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him.He
was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
sophisticatedly.The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far
apart.Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not
trust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree
as to how life and its affairs should be conducted.Lester had a
secret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the
almighty dollar.Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were
reprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later.In the
business they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance
with the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain
minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the
wind blew.Lester was for building up trade through friendly
relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors.Robert was
for pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and
offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these
troubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash.One or the other
would have to get out or perhaps both."If only you two boys could
agree!"Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on
the subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.Archibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to
get married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,
that he was sure of."The world expects it of a man in your position," his father had
argued from time to time."It makes for social solidity and prestige.You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family.Where will you
be when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any
home?""Well, if the right woman came along," said Lester, "I suppose I'd
marry her."No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women.You
can surely find some one if you try.I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;
it can't come to any good.""There, father, let it go now.I'll come
around some time, no doubt.I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to
water."The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore
point with him.He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of
affairs.The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any
permanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this
time.Of course he
would not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences.But he
must be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks.What a scandal if it were ever found out!Could he
install her in a nice home somewhere near the city?Could he take her along on his
numerous business journeys?This first one to New York had been
successful.He turned the question over in his
mind.Louis, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago would be best after all.He went to these places
frequently, and particularly to Chicago.He decided finally that it
should be Chicago if he could arrange it.He could always make excuses
to run up there, and it was only a night's ride.The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.After two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would
be all right for him to call and see her.She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had
secured a position in a store at four dollars a week.He smiled as he
thought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed
to him."She's the best I've come across
yet."He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her
place of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening.He
was anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over
with as quickly as possible.When he did call the shabbiness of the
house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but
somehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever.Gerhardt came in the
front-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands
with him, as did also Mrs.Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention
to them.The old German appeared to him to be merely
commonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
capacities in his father's factory.After some desultory conversation
Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.Jennie put
on her hat, and together they departed.As a matter of fact, they went
to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.When she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it
nothing amiss.CHAPTER XXV


A month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to
marry her.His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it
seemed natural enough.He did
not know just how this might be.Lester
seemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,
why not?If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,
why not a business man?"Has
she told him about Vesta?"Do you think he
wants her if he knows?That's what comes of such conduct in the first
place.Now she has to slip around like a thief.The child cannot even
have an honest name."Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding.His life
seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well
enough to hunt up another job as watchman.He wanted to get out of
this mess of deception and dishonesty.A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had
written her to join him in Chicago.He was not feeling well, and could
not come to Cleveland.The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie
was going away to be married to Mr.Gerhardt flared up at this,
and his suspicions were again aroused.But he could do nothing but
grumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he
was sure.When the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without
saying farewell to her father.He was out looking for work until late
in the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to
leave for the station."I will write a note to him when I get there,"
she said."Lester will take a
better house for us soon," she went on hopefully.The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and
the new one had begun.The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's
generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the
children and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser.Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities
and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an
enlarged purse permitted.But, after Jennie had
been in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that
Lester wanted them to take a new home.This letter was shown to
Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene.He
frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity.If he had
not married her why should he want to help them?Perhaps Jennie was
well married after all.Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high
station in life, and was now able to help the family.Gerhardt almost
concluded to forgive her everything once and for all.The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie
returned to Cleveland to help her mother move.Together they searched
the streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one.A
house of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was
secured and suitably furnished.There were comfortable fittings for
the dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom
sets complete for each room.The kitchen was supplied with every
convenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts
had never enjoyed before.Altogether the house was attractive, though
plain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be
comfortable in it.When the time came for the actual moving Mrs.Gerhardt was fairly
beside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her
dreams?All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,
and now it had come.A new house, new furniture, plenty of
room--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of
it!Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and
bureaus and whatnots."Dear, dear, isn't this nice!"Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction
without emotion, but there were tears in her eyes.She was so glad for
her mother's sake.She could have kissed Lester's feet for his
goodness to her family.Gerhardt, Martha, and
Veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things.At the sight of the
large rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise
of a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture
standing about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of
delight.George rubbed his feet over
the new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture
critically.Gerhardt roved to and fro
like a person in a dream.She could not believe that these bright
bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were
actually hers.Although he tried hard not to show it,
he, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment.The sight
of an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the
finishing touch.He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new
carpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a
white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the
bright, clean kitchen.We want to be careful now
not to break anything.It's so easy to scratch things up, and then
it's all over."CHAPTER XXVI


It would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
followed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an
abject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,
based, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the
generosity (through her) of her distant husband.Lester was seen now
and then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes
coming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best
rooms of the second floor.There were hurried trips on her
part--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.One of his favorite pastimes was to engage
quarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt.Clemens,
Saratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy
the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife.There were other times
when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing
her for a day.All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see
how he could remedy it at this time.He was not sure as yet that he
really wanted to.The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of
affairs was peculiar.At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it
seemed natural enough.No one had seen
her marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry
herself with the air of one who holds that relationship.Still, she
never went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his
relatives ever came near her.Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the
money which had first blinded them, was peculiar.He really did not
carry himself like a married man.There were
weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes.There
were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.Then there were the long periods in which she absented
herself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real
relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some
business judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was
suspicious.He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and
intuitively he felt that things were not right.George, nineteen, who
had gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking
forward to a career in that field, was also restless.Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were
William and Veronica.Each was offered an opportunity to study
indefinitely; but there was unrest with life.The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for
themselves.Gerhardt himself finally concluded
that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.He wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if
he could--but the worst had already been done.It depended on the
man now, he knew that.Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval
would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its
fortuitous solutions.Although stout
and formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years
become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,
coupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it
had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to
culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning.She
became decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the
few tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it
was very hard for her to climb stairs."I'm not feeling well," she
said."I think I'm going to be sick."Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
watering-place, but Mrs."I don't think it would
do any good," she said.She sat about or went driving with her
daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her."I don't like
to get sick in the fall," she said."The leaves coming down make me
think I am never going to get well."said Jennie; but she felt frightened,
nevertheless.How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it
was feared the end was near.Bass, who had thought of getting married
and getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.Gerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant
of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster.Jennie, too
inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her
mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her.Hoping in spite
of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of
patience, waiting and serving.The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days
of unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all
the family went about on tiptoe.Gerhardt passed away with her
dying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of
consciousness that life vouchsafed her.Jennie stared into her eyes
with a yearning horror.Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down
by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the
family.Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in
town for some time.Martha, whose views of life had broadened and
hardened, was anxious to get out also.She felt that a sort of stigma
attached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she
remained there.Martha looked to the public schools as a source of
income; she was going to be a teacher.Gerhardt alone scarcely knew
which way to turn.He was again at work as a night watchman.Jennie
found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
into tears herself.she pleaded, "it isn't as bad as
that.You will always have a home--you know that--as long as
I have anything.He really did not want to go with her."It
isn't that," he continued.It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally
left, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,
Veronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child.Of course
Lester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had
never seen the little girl.During the short periods in which he
deigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background.There
was a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and
concealment was easy.Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his
meals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of
the suite.He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of
the other members of the family.He was perfectly willing to shake
hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
perfunctory words only.It was generally understood that the child
must not appear, and so it did not.There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an
affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic.During that first year
in Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried
Vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks.When
she got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened
securely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she
was able to take a few steps of her own accord.When she actually
reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her
to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly.By some strange
leading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on
conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the
tendons of his heart.He loved this little outcast ardently,
hopefully.She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and
Gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education
in religious matters.Was it not he who had insisted that the infant
should be baptized?"Say 'Our Father,'" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he
had her alone with him."Ow Fowvaw," was her vowel-like interpretation of his words."'Ooh ah in aven,'" repeated the child.Gerhardt, overhearing
the little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels."Because I want she should learn the Christian faith," returned
Gerhardt determinedly.If she don't
begin now she never will know them."Many of her husband's religious
idiosyncrasies were amusing to her.At the same time she liked to see
this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing.If
he were only not so hard, so narrow at times.He made himself a
torment to himself and to every one else.On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to
take her for her first little journeys in the world."Come, now," he
would say, "we will go for a little walk."Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these
days Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete.Taking her by
the hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot
and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling
steps.One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started
on one of their walks.Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;
the birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making
the best of their brief span of life.Sparrows chirped in the road;
robins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the
cottages.Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of
nature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond.exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby.Her hand
was up, and her eyes were wide open."Yes," said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly
discovered this marvelous creature."It is going to look for a worm now.We
will see if we cannot find its nest.I think I saw a nest in one of
these trees."He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned
nest that he had observed on a former walk."Here it is," he said at
last, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten
remnant of a home was still clinging."Here, come now, see," and he
lifted the baby up at arm's length."See," said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his
free hand, "nest.repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of
her own."Yes," said Gerhardt, putting her down again."That was a wren's
nest.Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,
she wondering with the wide wonder of a child.When they had gone a
block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had
been reached.And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,
intelligence, and vivacity.Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions
she asked, the puzzles she pronounced."What is it she doesn't want to know?From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her
down at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief
solace and comfort of his days.Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have
found his life hard indeed to bear.CHAPTER XXVII


For three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of
Jennie.Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church
and of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was
perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment.His interest
in the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he
had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which
had himself as the object.He looked on his father's business
organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get
control of it; but he saw no way of doing so.Robert's interests were
always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther
apart than ever in their ideas and aims.Lester had thought once or
twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself
with another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could
conscientiously do this.Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand
a year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was
vice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside
investments.He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as
Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five
thousand, he had nothing.Robert, on the other hand, was
unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,
in addition to his future interest in the business, which both
brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.Robert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters
a sixth.It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,
seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.The old gentleman might do anything or
nothing.The probabilities were that he would be very fair and
liberal.At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the
game of life.There comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and
"takes stock" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with
his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material.This
time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when
the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins
to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
itself to everything.There is a deadening thought of uselessness
which creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been
best expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.he used to say to himself, "whether I live at the White House,
or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?"But in the very question
was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had
failed to realize in his own career.The White House represented the
rise and success of a great public character.His home and the Grand
Pacific were what had come to him without effort.He decided for the time being--it was about the period of the
death of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to
rehabilitate himself.He would cut out idling--these numerous
trips with Jennie had cost him considerable time.If his brother could find avenues of financial
profit, so could he.He would endeavor to assert his
authority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the
business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything.Should
he forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him.Somehow he did not see how it
could be done.It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked
to admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself.He liked
her--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.He didn't see how he
could desert her very well.Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.His brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established
paint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially
for the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was
growing and had a promising future.Lester, knowing the members of the
Eastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations
with the house, was in opposition.His father at first seemed to agree
with Lester.But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical
way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face."We
can't go on forever," he said, "standing by old friends, just because
father here has dealt with them, or you like them.The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more
and stronger competition.""It's just as father feels about it," said Lester at last."I have
no deep feeling in the matter.It won't hurt me one way or the other.You say the house is going to profit eventually.I've stated the
arguments on the other side.""I'm inclined to think Robert is right," said Archibald Kane
calmly."Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked
out.""Well, we won't have any more discussion about it
then," he said.He rose and strolled out of the office.The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering
pulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably.It wasn't
much but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's
business acumen was even more irritating.He was beginning to wonder
whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution
of the property.Had he heard anything about his entanglement with
Jennie?Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with
either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
concerned.He was still the investigator of
propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the
trusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being
worsted.He thought about this, but could reach no
conclusion.Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for
reorganization in the executive department of the business.He
proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage
warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of
their completed stock there.Buyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily
reached and dealt with there.It would be a big advertisement for the
house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.Kane
senior and Lester immediately approved of this.Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
construction of the new buildings.It would probably be advisable for
him to reside in Chicago a part of the time.The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from
Cincinnati, largely if not entirely.It was dignified and not
unrepresentative of his standing in the company.He could live in
Chicago and he could have Jennie with him.The scheme he had for
taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty."I'm sure we'll get good results from this all
around," he said.As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to
Chicago immediately.He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together
they selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite
of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to
suit his taste.He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a
bachelor.He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.There were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and
the hotels.To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically
ideal.Of course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
the Gerhardt family to a climax.Probably the home would be broken up,
but Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically.He was an old
man, and it did not matter much where he lived.Bass, Martha, and
George were already taking care of themselves.Veronica and William
were still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding
them with a neighbor.The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was
Vesta.It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the
child with her.he asked her, when the day of her
contemplated departure had been set."No; but I'm going to soon," she assured him."It's too bad," he went on.God will punish you,
I'm afraid.I'm getting old--otherwise
I would keep her.There is no one here all day now to look after her
right, as she should be.""I know," said Jennie weakly.I'm going
to have her live with me soon.I won't neglect her--you know
that.""But the child's name," he insisted.Soon
in another year she goes to school.People will want to know who she
is.Jennie understood well enough that it couldn't.The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant
separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's
very existence.It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did
not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise.Vesta had good
clothes, everything she needed.Jennie
hoped to give her a good education.If only she had told the truth to
Lester in the first place.Now it was almost too late, and yet she
felt that she had acted for the best.Finally she decided to find some
good woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a
consideration.In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she
came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she
required--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty.She was a widow,
doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
which she should give her whole time to Vesta.The latter was to go to
kindergarten when a suitable one should be found.She was to have toys
and kindly attention, and Mrs.Olsen was to inform Jennie of any
change in the child's health.Jennie proposed to call every day, and
she thought that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might
be brought to the apartment.She had had her with her at Cleveland,
and he had never found out anything.The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first
opportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away.Gerhardt, who had been
brooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her
future."She should grow up to be a fine girl," he said."You should
give her a good education--she is so smart."He spoke of the
advisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but
Jennie was not so sure of that.Time and association with Lester had
led her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any
private institution.She had no particular objection to the church,
but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the
affairs of life.The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.Vesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey.Gerhardt had
been wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of
dressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was
doing his best to control his feelings.He could see that the
five-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him.She was
happy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the
train."Be a good little girl," he said, lifting her up and kissing her."See that you study your catechism and say your prayers.And you won't
forget the grandpa--what?--" He tried to go on, but his
voice failed him.Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion."There," she said, "if I'd thought you were going to act like
that--" She stopped."Go," said Gerhardt, manfully, "go.And he
stood solemnly by as they went out of the door.Then he turned back to
his favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.One by one they were leaving him--Mrs.Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,
Jennie, Vesta.He clasped his hands together, after his old-time
fashion, and shook his head again and again.CHAPTER XXVIII


During the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been
associated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual
sympathy and understanding.Lester truly loved her in his own way.It
was a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly
on a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine
spiritual affinity.The yielding sweetness of her character both
attracted and held him.She was true, and good, and womanly to the
very center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon
her, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the
years.On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love
this man.At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her
soul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,
she was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had
always liked him.Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him
better, by watching his moods, she had come to love him.He was so
big, so vocal, so handsome.His point of view and opinions of anything
and everything were so positive.His pet motto, "Hew to the line, let
the chips fall where they may," had clung in her brain as something
immensely characteristic.Apparently he was not afraid of
anything--God, man, or devil.He used to look at her, holding her
chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:
"You're sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance.And her eyes would meet his in dumb
appeal."Never mind," he would add, "you have other things."One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in
which she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and
educational shortcomings.She could not write very well, and once he
found a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with
the meanings opposite.He smiled, but he liked her better for it.Louis he watched her
pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of
table manners was being observed by nearby diners.She could not
always be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking
dishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?"You're
hungry, aren't you?"I wouldn't bring you here if
they weren't.I'd tell
you quick enough when there was anything wrong."His brown eyes held a
friendly gleam."I do feel a little nervous at times," she
admitted.By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and
customs of comfortable existence.All that the Gerhardt family had
ever had were the bare necessities of life.Now she was surrounded
with whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the
whole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it
did not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of
things.There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in
privilege and opportunity.She was grateful to Lester for all that he
had done and was doing for her.If only she could hold
him--always!The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie
settled down into the routine of home life.Lester, busy about his
multitudinous affairs, was in and out.He had a suite of rooms
reserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the
exclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence.His
luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club.An
early patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,
so that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time.He was home two
or three nights a week, sometimes oftener.He insisted at first on
Jennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more
sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one
come in to do the cleaning.Her
natural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning.He
wanted dinner served nicely at seven.Silverware, cut glass, imported
china--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him.He kept
his trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.He was in the
habit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced
to run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss
Gerhardt.When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an
assumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind
using his own signature.Thus far there had been no difficulty or
unpleasantness of any kind.The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with
the danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta
had entailed, as well as with Jennie's natural anxiety about her
father and the disorganized home.Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,
that she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed
in a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left
alone.He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands
and his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was
hurt to think of his being left alone.She knew
that he would not--feeling as he did at present.Would Lester
have him--she was not sure of that.If he came Vesta would have
to be accounted for.The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated.Owing to
the feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie
was particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand
things to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.She daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs.Olsen, always taking with
her toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to
interest and please the child.She liked to sit with Vesta and tell
her stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.At last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester
was away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during
his several absences, to do this regularly.After that, as time went
on and she began to know his habits, she became more
bold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection
with Jennie.She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would
risk Vesta's presence on the assurance of even short
absences--two or three days.She even got into the habit of
keeping a few of Vesta's toys at the apartment, so that she could have
something to play with when she came.During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but
realize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife
and a happy mother.Vesta was a most observant little girl.She could
by her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger
of self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie's
heart.was one of her simplest and most
frequently repeated questions.Jennie would reply that mamma could not
have her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she
possibly could, Vesta should come to stay always."No, dearest, not just when.You won't mind waiting
a little while."Yes," replied Vesta; "but then she ain't got any nice things now.And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would
take Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of
playthings.Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious.His observation
of things relating to the home were rather casual.He went about his
work and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity
and good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was
anything underhanded in her actions.Once he did come home sick in the
afternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two
o'clock to five.He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,
but his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when
she found him there.She blanched at the thought of his suspecting
something, and explained as best she could.She had gone to see her
washerwoman.She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an
opportunity to serve him.It showed her what a mess she was likely to
make of it all.It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence
Lester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during
this time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there
was the happiest goings on between the mother and child.Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for
an oversight on Jennie's part, the far-reaching effects of which she
could only afterward regret.This was the leaving of a little toy lamb
under the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont
to lie and smoke.A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was
fastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was
shaken.Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had
deliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did
not notice at the time.When she gathered up the various playthings
after Vesta's departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it
rested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of
toyland, when Lester returned.That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying
his cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully
lighted.Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he
leaned over and looked under the divan.The cigar was not in sight, so
he rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the
little lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it.He picked it
up, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.It must belong to some neighbor's child in whom Jennie had
taken an interest, he thought.He would have to go and tease her about
this.Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out
into the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he
exclaimed in a mock solemn voice, "Where did this come from?"Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this
evidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with
the idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just
wrath upon her.Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as
quickly left them.she stuttered, "it's a little toy I bought.""I see it is," he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping
his observation, but having at the same time no explicable
significance to him."It's frisking around a mighty lone
sheepfold."He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,
unable to speak.It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.His manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.However, it was almost impossible for her to recover her
self-possession."You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.""I forgot to take it out from there, that was all," she went on
blindly."It looks as though it has been played with enough," he added more
seriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful
to her, he dropped it.The lamb had not furnished him the amusement
that he had expected.Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and
thought it over.What was there about a toy to
make her grow pale?Surely there was no harm in her harboring some
youngster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come
in and play.He thought it over, but
could come to no conclusion.Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb.Time
might have wholly effaced the impression from Lester's memory had
nothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any
kind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon
its heels.One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat
later than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the
kitchen, Lester went himself to open the door.He was greeted by a
middle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in
broken Swedish accents for Jennie."Wait a moment," said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he
called her.Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously
out in the hall and closed the door after her.The action instantly
struck Lester as suspicious.He frowned and determined to inquire
thoroughly into the matter.Her face
was white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to
seize upon.he inquired, the irritation he had felt the
moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness."I've got to go out for a little while," she at last managed to
reply."Very well," he assented unwillingly."But you can tell me what's
the trouble with you, can't you?"I--I," began Jennie, stammering."I--have--"

"Yes," he said grimly."I have to go on an errand," she stumbled on.I'll tell you when I come back, Lester.She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by
preoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen
this look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and
irritated by it."That's all right," he said, "but what's the use of all this
secrecy?Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?What's the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was
intensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as
the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an
emotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,
who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed
her stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you're not
acting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity
and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,
troubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It's my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I
come back.""What the hell are you talking
about?""I couldn't help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should
have told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go
now, and I'll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to
force her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said
quietly."Don't you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been
deceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:

"Well, I'll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX


The reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of
those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can
predict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with
membranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since
had been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened
to death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta
was very ill and Mrs.This message,
delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object
was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie
and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner
described.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach
her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should
already be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should
be no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street
lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of
Lester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her
alone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered
only the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that
she was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps
but for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well
to-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,
with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the
instinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me
for my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have
known."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and
into the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but
considerably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged
physician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as
she dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned
grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far
as possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer
attempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt
an agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the
one right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie
realized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it
had created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with
Lester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what
end?She sat there and
meditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted
down, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this
discovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was
the father of the child?How did it chance to be in
Chicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could
not answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at
Mrs.What was it about her then that
had attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours'
observation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was
it--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been
art in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in
deceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than
practise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to
Lester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,
and to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very
disturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way
before--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw
strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling
toward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended
her?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace
slowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the
full his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt
able to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued
deception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all
had been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which
no man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved
irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and
walked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged
by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was
due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the
yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable
perversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of
keeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,
aside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in
the balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal
herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the
fact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her
once tentatively about her past.That
was the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk
out and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of
this business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,
stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car
and went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and
chatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and
irritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab
and returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last
made to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims
of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the
promise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the
very end.It was just
probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before
breaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the
certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless
felt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for
all her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall
light was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her
key.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in
the expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his
part.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she
came instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken
her--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with
his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy
eyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He
took off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he
was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide
eyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he
began.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap
in the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:

"It's Senator Brander's."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but
still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in
his ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my
mother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her
sobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander's child," he
thought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of
the common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed
washerwoman's daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a
darkling mood."It's been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and
then continued:

"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone
more peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn't let her come out anywhere where
you could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he
exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family
could have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn't want to tell you about her."I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,
Lester.I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was
ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was
afraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the
suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of
circumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a
combination of affairs!"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her
that way.Why didn't you tell me in the first place?I wouldn't have
thought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of
his attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after
a time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along
without any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest
that, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might
have pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was
hanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come
to get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,
winced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far
the most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed
to be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get
his laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to
hear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give
me money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it
would be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his
questioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before
he could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five
minutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the
mantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what
would follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,
the moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to
sentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should
pursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of
his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon
the whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He
turned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the
mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,
uncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering
this difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to
hear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the
clothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there
was some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she
felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of
despair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the
agony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,
her state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX


The sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his
future course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,
he did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably.He did
not like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking
about in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he
admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story
out of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have
lied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the
history of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to
ever think of marrying her.It couldn't be done, not by a man in his
position.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable
provision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his
mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do
it at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this
kind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow
with usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with
him.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much
about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or
quickly.He could think of it bustling
about the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when
night came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he
discovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was
Jennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her
in this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come
by that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better
than hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have
been something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or
what he would do with her.Being
uncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then
again, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of
a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a
brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,
and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go
back and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of
it--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the
beginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he
was parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie
had made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close
to him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had
not so much to do with real love as with ambition.His
father--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his
sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he
were temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been
happy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he
stayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to
have a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of
understanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She
must understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be
made to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no
immediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the
apartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"
began Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you'd better do it at once."He took an evening
newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front
windows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand
each other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,
and made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you
didn't want the child's life mixed with mine.You might have known
that it couldn't be done.That's neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a
relationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I
thought.I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative
relationship with you on this basis."Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don't see
why things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the
present--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the
yard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would
really come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the
apartment and go to his club?"You'd better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning
toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It
was a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He
strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was
thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his
final decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been
wrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his
favorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and
washed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent
student of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal
from her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation
would work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right
away--that is something.She sighed
as she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her
Lester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI


There was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie
went the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the
reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now
I can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times
during the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make
himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his
life--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had
suggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this
apartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way
through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane.Daniel went to the bedroom."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"Daniel moved to the kitchen.He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.Why are good resolutions like fainting ladies?Take away my first letter, I remain unchanged; take away my second
letter, there is no apparent alteration in me; take away all my letters
and I still continue unchanged.Because he never reaches the
age of discretion.Why is a new-born baby like a storm?O'Donoghue came to the hermit's cell;
    He climbed the ladder, he pulled the bell;
    "I have ridden," said he, "with the saint to dine
    On his richest meal and his reddest wine."The hermit hastened my _first_ to fill
    With water from the limpid rill;
    And "drink," quoth he, of the "juice, brave knight,
    Which breeds no fever, and prompts no fight."The hermit hastened my _second_ to spread
    With stalks of lettuce and crusts of bread;
    And "taste," quoth he, "of the cates, fair guest,
    Which bring no surfeit, and break no rest."Hasty and hungry the chief explored
    My _whole_ with the point of his ready sword,
    And found, as yielded the latch and lock,

    the other turns his quartz into gold?When it's (s)ticking there.The mother looked at him, and believed him."Then our Lord has been
here Himself," she said quietly, sitting down on the floor and gazing
before her.Nils lay quite stiff, with open eyes and mouth, and hands drawn near
together, as though he had at the last moment tried to fold them, but
had been unable to do so.The first thing the mother now did was to
fold them."Let us look closer at him," she said then, going over to
the fireplace, where the fire was almost out.Arne followed her, for
he felt afraid of standing alone.She gave him a lighted fir-splinter
to hold; then she once more went over to the dead body and stood by
one side of it, while the son stood at the other, letting the light
fall upon it."Yes, he's quite gone," she said; and then, after a little while, she
continued, "and gone in an evil hour, I'm afraid."Arne's hands trembled so much that the burning ashes of the splinter
fell upon the father's clothes and set them on fire; but the boy did
not perceive it, neither did the mother at first, for she was
weeping.But soon she became aware of it through the bad smell, and
she cried out in fear.When now the boy looked, it seemed to him as
though the father himself was burning, and he dropped the splinter
upon him, sinking down in a swoon.Up and down, and round and round,
the room moved with him; the table moved, the bed moved; the axe
hewed; the father rose and came to him; and then all of them came
rolling upon him.Then he felt as if a soft cooling breeze passed
over his face; and he cried out and awoke.The first thing he did was
to look at the father, to assure himself that he still lay quietly.And a feeling of inexpressible happiness came over the boy's mind
when he saw that the father was dead--really dead; and he rose as
though he were entering upon a new life.The mother had extinguished the burning clothes, and began to lay out
the body.She made the bed, and then said to Arne, "Take hold of your
father, you're so strong, and help me to lay him nicely."They laid
him on the bed, and Margit shut his eyes and mouth, stretched his
limbs, and folded his hands once more.It was only a little past
midnight, and they had to stay there with him till morning.Arne made
a good fire, and the mother sat down by it.While sitting there, she
looked back upon the many miserable days she had passed with Nils,
and she thanked God for taking him away."But still I had some happy
days with him, too," she said after a while.Arne took a seat opposite her; and, turning to him, she went on, "And
to think that he should have such an end as this!even if he has not
lived as he ought, truly he has suffered for it."She wept, looked
over to the dead man, and continued, "But now God grant I may be
repaid for all I have gone through with him.Arne, you must remember
it was for your sake I suffered it all.""Therefore, you must never leave me," she sobbed; "you are now my
only comfort.""I never will leave you; that I promise before God," the boy said, as
earnestly as if he had thought of saying it for years.He felt a
longing to go over to her; yet he could not.She grew calmer, and, looking kindly over at the dead man, she said,
"After all, there was a great deal of good in him; but the world
dealt hardly by him.... But now he's gone to our Lord, and He'll be
kinder to him, I'm sure."Then, as if she had been following out this
thought within herself, she added, "We must pray for him.If I could,
I would sing over him; but you, Arne, have such a fine voice, you
must go and sing to your father."Arne fetched the hymn-book and lighted a fir-splinter; and, holding
it in one hand and the book in the other, he went to the head of the
bed and sang in a clear voice Kingo's 127th hymn:

   "Regard us again in mercy, O God!And turn Thou aside Thy terrible rod,
    That now in Thy wrath laid on us we see
    To chasten us sore for sin against Thee.""HE HAD IN HIS MIND A SONG."Yet he continued tending the
cattle upon the mountains in the summer, while in the winter he
remained at home studying.About this time the clergyman sent a message, asking him to become
the parish schoolmaster, and saying his gifts and knowledge might
thus be made useful to his neighbors.Arne sent no answer; but the
next day, while he was driving his flock, he made the following
verses:

   "O, my pet lamb, lift your head,
    Though a stony path you tread,
    Over all the lonely fells,
    Only follow still your bells.O, my pet lamb, walk with care;
    Lest you spoil your wool, beware:
    Mother now must soon be sewing
    New lamb-skins, for summer's going.O, my pet lamb, try to grow
    Fat and fine where'er you go:
    Know you not, my little sweeting,
    A spring-lamb is dainty eating?"One day he happened to overhear a conversation between his mother and
the late owner of the place: they were at odds about the horse of
which they were joint-owners."I must wait and hear what Arne says,"
interposed the mother.the man exclaimed; "he would
like the horse to ramble about in the wood, just as he does himself."Then the mother became silent, though before she had been pleading
her cause well.That his mother had to bear people's jeers on
his account, never before occurred to him, and, "Perhaps she had
borne many," he thought."But why had she not told him of it?"He turned the matter over, and then it came into his mind that the
mother scarcely ever talked to him at all.But, then, he scarcely
ever talked to her either.But, after all, whom did he talk much to?Often on Sundays, when he was sitting quietly at home, he would have
liked to read the sermon to his mother, whose eyes were weak, for she
had wept too much in her time.Often, too,
on weekdays, when she was sitting down, and he thought the time might
hang heavy, he would have liked to offer to read some of his own
books to her: still, he did not."Well, never mind," thought he: "I'll soon leave off tending the
cattle on the mountains; and then I'll be more with mother."He let
this resolve ripen within him for several days: meanwhile he drove
his cattle far about in the wood, and made the following verses:

   "The vale is full of trouble, but here sweet Peace may reign;
    Within this quiet forest no bailiffs may distrain;
    None fight, like all in the vale, in the Blessed Church's name;
    But still if a church were here, perhaps 'twould be just the same.Here all are at peace--true, the hawk is rather unkind;
    I fear he is looking now the plumpest sparrow to find;
    I fear yon eagle is coming to rob the kid of his breath;
    But still if he lived very long he might be tired to death.The woodman fells one tree, and another rots away:
    The red fox killed the lambkin at sunset yesterday;
    But the wolf killed the fox; and the wolf, too, had to die,
    For Arne shot him down to-day before the dew was dry.Back I'll go to the valley: the forest is just as bad--
    I must take heed, however, or thinking will drive me mad--
    I saw a boy in my dreams, though where I cannot tell--
    But I know he had killed his father, and I think it was in hell."Then he went home and told the mother she might send for a lad to
tend the cattle on the mountains; and that he would himself manage
the farm: and so it was arranged.But the mother was constantly
hovering about him, warning him not to work too hard.Then, too, she
used to get him such nice meals that he often felt quite ashamed to
take them; yet he said nothing.He had in his mind a song having for its burden, "Over the mountains
high;" but he never could complete it, principally because he always
tried to bring the burden in every alternate line; so afterwards he
gave this up.But several of his songs became known, and were much liked; and many
people, especially those who had known him from his childhood, were
fond of talking to him.But he was shy to all whom he did not know,
and he thought ill of them, mainly because he fancied they thought
ill of him.In the next field to his own worked a middle-aged man named
Opplands-Knut, who used sometimes to sing, but always the same song.After Arne had heard him singing it for several months, he thought he
would ask him whether he did not know any others.Then after a few more days, when he was again singing his
song, Arne asked him, "How came you to learn that one song?"it happened thus----" and then he said no more.Arne went away from him straight indoors; and there he found his
mother weeping; a thing he had not seen her do ever since the
father's death.He turned back again, just as though he did not
notice it; but he felt the mother was looking sorrowfully after him,
and he was obliged to stop.She did not answer, and
all was silent in the room.Then his words came back to him again,
and he felt they had not been spoken so kindly as they ought; and
once more, in a gentler tone, he asked, "What are you crying for,
mother?""Ah, I hardly know," she said, weeping still more.He stood silent a
while; but at last mustered courage to say, "Still, there must be
some reason why you are crying."Again there was silence; but although the mother had not said one
word of blame, he felt he was very guilty towards her."Well it just
came over me," she said after a while; and in a few moments she
added, "but really, I'm very happy;" and then she began weeping
again.Arne hurried out, away to the ravine; and while he sat there looking
into it, he, too, began weeping."If I only knew what I am crying
for," he said.Then he heard Opplands-Knut singing in the fields above him:

   "Ingerid Sletten of Willow-pool
      Had no costly trinkets to wear;
      But a cap she had that was far more fair,
    Although 'twas only of wool.It had no trimming, and now was old;
      But her mother, who long had gone,
      Had given it her, and so it shone
    To Ingerid more than gold.For twenty years she laid it aside,
      That it might not be worn away:
      'My cap I'll wear on that blissful day
    When I shall become a bride.'For thirty years she laid it aside
      Lest the colors might fade away:
      'My cap I'll wear when to God I pray,
    A happy and grateful bride.'For forty years she laid it aside,
      Still holding her mother as dear:
      'My little cap, I certainly fear
    I never shall be a bride.'She went to look for the cap one day
      In the chest where it long had lain;
      But, ah!her looking was all in vain:
    The cap had mouldered away."Arne listened, and the words seemed to him like music playing far
away over the mountains.He went up to Knut and asked him, "Have you
a mother?""Ah, yes; it's long since.""You haven't many, I dare say, who love you?""Haven't you any at all then who love you?""Ah, no; I haven't any."But Arne walked away with his heart so full of love to his mother
that it seemed as if it would burst; and all around him grew bright.He felt he must go in again, if only for the sake of looking at her.As he walked on the thought struck him, "What if I were to lose her?""Almighty God, what would then become of me?"Then he felt as if some dreadful accident was happening at home, and
he hurried onwards, cold drops bursting from his brow, and his feet
hardly touching the ground.He threw open the outer door, and came at
once into an atmosphere of peace.Then he gently opened the door of
the inner room.The mother had gone to bed, and lay sleeping as
calmly as a child, with the moonbeams shining full on her face.A few days after, the mother and son agreed on going together to the
wedding of some relations in one of the neighboring places.The
mother had not been to a party ever since she was a girl; and both
she and Arne knew but very little of the people living around, save
their names.Arne felt uncomfortable at this party, however, for he fancied
everybody was staring at him: and once, as he was passing through the
passage, he believed he heard something said about him, the mere
thought of which made every drop of blood rush into his face.He kept going about looking after the man who had said it, and at
last he took a seat next him.When they were at dinner, the man said, "Well, now, I shall tell you
a story which proves nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't
one day be brought to light;" and Arne fancied he looked at him all
the time he was saying this.He was an ugly-looking man, with scanty
red hair, hanging about a wide, round forehead, small, deep-set eyes,
a little snub-nose, and a large mouth, with pale out-turned lips,
which showed both his gums when he laughed.His hands were resting on
the table; they were large and coarse, but the wrists were slender.He had a fierce look; and he spoke quickly, but with difficulty.The
people called him "Bragger;" and Arne knew that in bygone days, Nils,
the tailor, had treated him badly."Yes," continued the man, "there is indeed, a great deal of sin in
the world; and it sits nearer to us than we think.... But never mind;
I'll tell you now of a foul deed.Those of you who are old will
remember Alf--Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say:
and he has left that saying behind him.When he had struck a
bargain--and what a fellow for trade he was!--he would take up his
bundle, and say, 'I'll call again.'A devil of a fellow, proud
fellow, brave fellow, was he, Alf, the pedlar!"Well he and Big Lazy-bones, Big Lazy-bones--well, you know Big
Lazy-bones?--big he was, and lazy he was, too.He took a fancy to a
coal-black horse that Alf, the pedlar, used to drive, and had trained
to hop like a summer frog.And almost before Big Lazy-bones knew what
he was about, he paid fifty dollars for this horse!Then Big
Lazy-bones, tall as he was, got into a carriage, meaning to drive
about like a king with his fifty-dollar-horse; but, though he whipped
and swore like a devil, the horse kept running against all the doors
and windows; for it was stone-blind!"Afterwards, whenever Alf and Big Lazy-bones came across each other,
they used to quarrel and fight about this horse like two dogs.Big
Lazy-bones said he would have his money back; but he could not get a
farthing of it: and Alf drubbed him till the bristles flew.'I'll
call again,' said Alf.A devil of a fellow, proud fellow, brave
fellow that Alf--Alf, the pedlar!"Well, after that some years passed away without his being seen
again."Then, in about ten years or so, a call for him was published on the
church-hill,[2] for a great fortune had been left him.'Ah,' said he, 'I well knew it must be
money, and not men, that called out for Alf, the pedlar.'[2] In Norway, certain public announcements are made before the
 church door on Sundays after service.--Translators."Now, there was a good deal of talk one way and another about Alf;
and at last it seemed to be pretty clearly made out that he had been
seen for the last time on _this_ side of the ledge, and not on the
other.Well, you remember the road over the ledge--the old road?"Of late, Big Lazy-bones had got quite a great man, and he owned both
houses and land.Then, too, he had taken to being religious; and
that, everybody knew, he didn't take to for nothing--nobody does."Just at this time the road over the ledge had to be altered.Folks
in bygone days had a great fancy for going straight onwards; and so
the old road ran straight over the ledge; but now-a-days we like to
have things smooth and easy; and so the new road was made to run down
along the river.While they were making it, there was digging and
mining enough to bring down the whole mountain about their ears; and
the magistrates and all the officers who have to do with that sort of
thing were there.One day while the men were digging deep in the
stony ground, one of them took up something which he thought was a
stone; but it turned out to be the bones of a man's hand instead; and
a wonderfully strong hand it seemed to be, for the man who got it
fell flat down directly.The magistrate
was just strolling about round there, and they fetched him to the
place; and then all the bones belonging to a whole man were dug out.The Doctor, too, was fetched; and he put them all together so
cleverly that nothing was wanting but the flesh.And then it struck
some of the people that the skeleton was just about the same size
and make as Alf, the pedlar.'I'll call again,' Alf used to say."And then it struck somebody else, that it was a very queer thing a
dead hand should have made a great fellow like Big Lazy-bones fall
flat down like that: and the magistrate accused him straight of
having had more to do with that dead hand than he ought--of course,
when nobody else was by.But then Big Lazy-bones foreswore it with
such fearful oaths that the magistrate turned quite giddy.'Well,'
said the magistrate, 'if you didn't do it, I dare say you're a
fellow, now, who would not mind sleeping with the skeleton
to-night?'--'No; I shouldn't mind a bit,--not I,' said Big
Lazy-bones.So the Doctor tied the joints of the skeleton together,
and laid it in one of the beds in the barracks; and put another bed
close by it for Big Lazy-bones.The magistrate wrapped himself in his
cloak, and lay down close to the door outside.When night came on,
and Big Lazy-bones had to go in to his bedfellow, the door shut
behind him as though of itself, and he stood in the dark.But then
Big Lazy-bones set off singing psalms, for he had a mighty voice.'May be the bells were never tolled for him,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then he began praying out loud, as earnestly as ever he
could.asked the magistrate from outside the
wall.'No doubt, he has been a great sinner,' answered Big
Lazy-bones.Then a time after, all got so still that the magistrate
might have gone to sleep.But then came a shrieking that made the
very barracks shake: 'I'll call again!'--Then came a hellish noise
and crash: 'Out with that fifty dollars of mine!'roared Big
Lazy-bones: and the shrieking and crashing came again.Then the
magistrate burst open the door; the people rushed in with poles and
firebrands; and there lay Big Lazy-bones on the floor, with the
skeleton on the top of him."There was a deep silence all round the table.At last a man who was
lighting his clay-pipe said, "Didn't he go mad from that very time?"Arne fancied everybody was looking at him, and he dared not raise his
eyes."I say, as I said before," continued the man who had told the
tale, "nothing can be buried so deeply that it won't one day be
brought to light.""Well, now I'll tell you about a son who beat his own father," said a
fair stout man with a round face.Arne no longer knew where he was
sitting."This son was a great fellow, almost a giant, belonging to a tall
family in Hardanger; and he was always at odds with somebody or
other.He and his father were always quarrelling about the yearly
allowance; and so he had no peace either at home or out."This made him grow more and more wicked; and the father persecuted
him.'I won't be put down by anybody,' the son said.'Yes, you'll be
put down by me so long as I live,' the father answered.'If you don't
hold your tongue,' said the son, rising, 'I'll strike you.'--'Well,
do if you dare; and never in this world will you have luck again,'
answered the father, rising also.--'Do you mean to say that?'said
the son; and he rushed upon him and knocked him down.But the father
didn't try to help himself: he folded his arms and let the son do
just as he liked with him.Then he knocked him about, rolled him over
and over, and dragged him towards the door by his white hair.'I'll
have peace in my own house, at any rate,' said he.But when they had
come to the door, the father raised himself a little and cried out,
'Not beyond the door, for so far I dragged my own father.'The son
didn't heed it, but dragged the old man's head over the threshold.And the old man rose, knocked down the
son and beat him as one would beat a child.""Ah, that's a sad story," several said.Then Arne fancied he heard
some one saying, "It's a wicked thing to strike one's father;" and he
rose, turning deadly pale."Now I'll tell _you_ something," he said; but he hardly knew what he
was going to say: words seemed flying around him like large
snowflakes."I'll catch them at random," he said and began:--

"A troll once met a lad walking along the road weeping.'Whom are
you most afraid of?'asked the troll, 'yourself or others?'Now,
the boy was weeping because he had dreamed last night he had killed
his wicked father; and so he answered, 'I'm most afraid of
myself.'--'Then fear yourself no longer, and never weep again; for
henceforward you shall only have strife with others.'But the first whom the lad met jeered at him; and so
the lad jeered at him again.The second he met beat him; and so he
beat him again.The third he met tried to kill him; and so the lad
killed him.Then all the people spoke ill of the lad; and so he spoke
ill again of all the people.They shut the doors against him, and
kept all their things away from him; so he stole what he wanted; and
he even took his night's rest by stealth.As now they wouldn't let
him come to do anything good, he only did what was bad; and all that
was bad in other people, they let him suffer for.And the people in
the place wept because of the mischief done by the lad; but he did
not weep himself, for he could not.Then all the people met together
and said, 'Let's go and drown him, for with him we drown all the
evil that is in the place.'So they drowned him forthwith; but
afterwards they thought the well where he was drowned gave forth a
mighty odor."The lad himself didn't at all know he had done anything wrong; and
so after his death he came drifting in to our Lord.There, sitting on
a bench, he saw his father, whom he had not killed, after all; and
opposite the father, on another bench, sat the one whom he had jeered
at, the one he had beaten, the one he had killed, and all those whom
he had stolen from, and those whom he had otherwise wronged."'Whom are you afraid of,' our Lord asked, 'of your father, or of
those on the long bench?'"'Sit down then by your father,' said our Lord; and the lad went to
sit down.But then the father fell down from the bench with a large
axe-cut in his neck.In his seat, came one in the likeness of the lad
himself, but with a thin and ghastly pale face; another with a
drunkard's face, matted hair, and drooping limbs; and one more with
an insane face, torn clothes, and frightful laughter."'So it might have happened to you,' said our Lord.said the boy, catching hold of the Lord's coat."Then both the benches fell down from heaven; but the boy remained
standing near the Lord rejoicing."'Remember this when you awake,' said our Lord; and the boy awoke."The boy who dreamed so is I; those who tempted him by thinking him
bad are you.I am no longer afraid of myself, but I am afraid of you.Do not force me to evil; for it is uncertain if I get hold of the
Lord's coat."He ran out: the men looked at each other.THE SOLILOQUY IN THE BARN.On the evening of the day after this, Arne was lying in a barn
belonging to the same house.For the first time in his life he had
become drunk, and he had been lying there for the last twenty-four
hours.Now he sat up, resting upon his elbows, and talked with
himself:

"... Everything I look at turns to cowardice.It was cowardice that
hindered me from running away while a boy; cowardice that made me
listen to father more than to mother; cowardice also made me sing
the wicked songs to him.I began tending the cattle through
cowardice,--to read--well, that, too, was through cowardice: I
wished to get away from myself.When, though a grown up lad, yet
I didn't help mother against father--cowardice; that I didn't that
night--ugh!--cowardice!I might perhaps have waited till she was
killed!... I couldn't bear to stay at home afterwards--cowardice;
still I didn't go away--cowardice; I did nothing, I tended cattle...
cowardice.'Tis true I promised mother to stay at home; still I
should have been cowardly enough to break my promise if I hadn't been
afraid of mixing among people.For I'm afraid of people, mainly
because I think they see how bad I am; and because I'm afraid of
them, I speak ill of them--a curse upon my cowardice!I'm afraid of thinking bravely about my own
affairs, and so I turn aside and think about other people's; and
making verses is just that."I've cause enough to weep till the hills turned to lakes, but
instead of that I say to myself, 'Hush, hush,' and begin rocking.And
even my songs are cowardly; for if they were bold they would be
better.I'm afraid of strong thoughts; afraid of anything that's
strong; and if ever I rise into it, it's in a passion, and passion is
cowardice.I'm more clever and know more than I seem; I'm better than
my words, but my cowardice makes me afraid of showing myself in my
true colors.I drank that spirits through cowardice;
I wanted to deaden my pain--shame upon me!I felt miserable all
the while I was drinking it, yet I drank; drank my father's
heart's-blood, and still I drank!In fact there's no end to my
cowardice; and the most cowardly thing is, that I can sit and tell
myself all this!I am a vast deal too cowardly for that.Then, too, I believe a little in God... yes, I believe in God.I
would fain go to Him; but cowardice keeps me from going: it would be
such a great change that a coward shrinks from it.But if I were to
put forth what power I have?Thou wouldst
cure me in such a way as my milky spirit can bear; wouldst lead me
gently; for I have no bones in me, nor even gristle--nothing but
jelly.If I tried... with good, gentle books,--I'm afraid of the
strong ones--; with pleasant tales, stories, all that is mild, and
then a sermon every Sunday, and a prayer every evening.If I tried to
clear a field within me for religion; and worked in good earnest, for
one cannot sow in laziness.If I tried; dear mild God of my
childhood, if I tried!"But then the barn-door was opened, and the mother came rushing across
the floor.Her face was deadly pale, though the perspiration dropped
from it like great tears.For the last twenty-four hours she had
been rushing hither and thither, seeking her son, calling his name,
and scarcely pausing even to listen, until now when he answered from
the barn.Then she gave a loud cry, jumped upon the hay-mow more
lightly than a boy, and threw herself upon Arne's breast....

... "Arne, Arne are you here?At last I've found you; I've been
looking for you ever since yesterday; I've been looking for you all
night long!I saw they worried you, and I wanted to
come to speak to you and comfort you, but really I'm always afraid!"... "Arne, I saw you drinking spirits!Almighty God, may I never see
it again!It was some minutes
before she was able to speak again."Christ have mercy upon you, my
boy, I saw you drinking spirits!... You were gone all at once, drunk
and crushed by grief as you were!I ran all over the place; I went
far into the fields; but I couldn't find you: I looked in every
copse; I questioned everybody; I came here, too; but you didn't
answer.... Arne, Arne, I went along the river; but it seemed nowhere
to be deep enough...." She pressed herself closer to him."Then it came into my mind all at once that you might have gone home;
and I'm sure I was only a quarter of an hour going there.I opened
the outer-door and looked in every room; and then, for the first
time, I remembered that the house had been locked up, and I myself
had the key; and that you could not have come in, after all.Arne,
last night I looked all along both sides of the road: I dared not go
to the edge of the ravine.... I don't know how it was I came here
again; nobody told me; it must have been the Lord himself who put it
into my mind that you might be here!"She paused and lay for a while with her head upon his breast."Arne, you'll never drink spirits again, I'm sure?""No; you may be sure I never will.""I believe they were very hard upon you?"No; it was I who was _cowardly_," he answered, laying a great stress
upon the word."I can't understand how they could behave badly to you.But, tell me,
what did they do?you never will tell me anything;" and once more she
began weeping."But you never tell me anything, either," he said in a low gentle
voice."Yet you're the most in fault, Arne: I've been so long used to
be silent through your father; you ought to have led me on a
little.--Good Lord!we've only each other; and we've suffered so
much together.""Well, we must try to manage better," Arne whispered.... "Next Sunday I'll read the sermon to you.""I've greatly sinned against you; I've done something very wrong.""Indeed, I have; but I couldn't help doing it."But I'm sure you've never done anything wrong to me.""Indeed, I have: and my very love to you made me do it.But you must
forgive me; will you?""And then another time I'll tell you all about it... but you must
forgive me!""And don't you see the reason why I couldn't talk much to you was,
that I had this on my mind?"Pray don't talk so, mother!""Well, I'm glad I've said what I have.""And, mother, we'll talk more together, we two.""Yes, that we will; and then you'll read the sermon to me?""I think we both had better go home now.""Yes; your father once lay weeping in this barn.""You're looking all round, Arne?""It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I strolled to the wood, and down I lay,
      And rocked what came in my mind:
    But there the emmets crawled on the ground,
    And wasps and gnats were stinging around.'Won't you go out-doors this fine day, dear?'said mother, as she sat
in the porch, spinning.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      No rest indoors could I find;
    So I went in the birk, and down I lay,
      And sang what came in my mind:
    But snakes crept out to bask in the sun--
    Snakes five feet long, so, away I run.'In such beautiful weather one may go barefoot,' said mother, taking
off her stockings.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not abide;
    So I went in a boat, and down I lay,
      And floated away with the tide:
    But the sun-beams burned till my nose was sore;
    So I turned my boat again to the shore.'This is, indeed, good weather to dry the hay,' said mother, putting
her rake into a swath.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      In the house I could not be;
    And so from the heat I climbed away
      In the boughs of a shady tree:
    But caterpillars dropped on my face,
    So down I jumped and ran from the place.'Well, if the cow doesn't get on to-day, she never will get on,' said
mother, glancing up towards the <DW72>.It was such a cheerful, sunny day,
      Indoors I could not remain:
    And so for quiet I rowed away
      To the waterfall amain:
    But there I drowned while bright was the sky:
    If you made this, it cannot be I.'Only three more such sunny days, and we shall get in all the hay,'
said mother, as she went to make my bed."Arne when a child had not cared much for fairy-tales; but now he
began to love them, and they led him to the sagas and old ballads.He
also read sermons and other religious books; and he was gentle and
kind to all around him.But in his mind arose a strange deep longing:
he made no more songs; but walked often alone, not knowing what was
within him.Many of the places around, which formerly he had not even noticed,
now appeared to him wondrously beautiful.At the time he and his
schoolfellows had to go to the Clergyman to be prepared for
confirmation, they used to play near a lake lying just below the
parsonage, and called the Swart-water because it lay deep and dark
between the mountains.He now often thought of this place; and one
evening he went thither.He sat down behind a grove close to the parsonage, which was built on
a steep hill-side, rising high above till it became a mountain.High
mountains rose likewise on the opposite shore, so that broad deep
shadows fell upon both sides of the lake, but in the middle ran a
stripe of bright silvery water.It was a calm evening near sunset,
and not a sound was heard save the tinkling of the cattle-bells from
the opposite shore.Arne at first did not look straight before him,
but downwards along the lake, where the sun was sprinkling burning
red ere it sank to rest.There, at the end, the mountains gave way,
and between them lay a long low valley, against which the lake beat;
but they seemed to run gradually towards each other, and to hold the
valley in a great swing.Houses lay thickly scattered all along, the
smoke rose and curled away, the fields lay green and reeking, and
boats laden with hay were anchored by the shore.Arne saw many people
going to and fro, but he heard no noise.Thence his eye went along
the shore towards God's dark wood upon the mountain-sides.Through
it, man had made his way, and its course was indicated by a winding
stripe of dust.This, Arne's eye followed to opposite where he was
sitting: there, the wood ended, the mountains opened, and houses lay
scattered all over the valley.They were nearer and looked larger
than those in the other valley; and they were red-painted, and their
large windows glowed in the sunbeams.The fields and meadows stood in
strong light, and the smallest child playing in them was clearly
seen; glittering white sands lay dry upon the shore, and some dogs
and puppies were running there.But suddenly all became sunless and
gloomy: the houses looked dark red, the meadows dull green, the sand
greyish white, and the children little clumps: a cloud of mist had
risen over the mountains, taking away the sunlight.Arne looked down
into the water, and there he found all once more: the fields lay
rocking, the wood silently drew near, the houses stood looking down,
the doors were open, and children went out and in.Fairy-tales and
childish things came rushing into his mind, as little fishes come to
a bait, swim away, come once more and play round, and again swim
away."Let's sit down here till your mother comes; I suppose the
Clergyman's lady will have finished sometime or other."Arne was
startled: some one had been sitting a little way behind him."If I might but stay this one night more," said an imploring voice,
half smothered by tears: it seemed to be that of a girl not quite
grown up."Now don't cry any more; it's wrong to cry because you're going home
to your mother," was slowly said by a gentle voice, which was
evidently that of a man."It's not that, I am crying for.""Because I shall not live any longer with Mathilde."This was the name of the Clergyman's only daughter; and Arne
remembered that a peasant-girl had been brought up with her."Still, that couldn't go on for ever.""Well, but only one day more father, dear!""No, it's better we take you home now; perhaps, indeed, it's already
too late.""You were born a peasant, and a peasant you shall be; we can't afford
to keep a lady.""But I might remain a peasant all the same if I stayed there.""I've always worn my peasant's dress.""Clothes have nothing to do with it.""I've spun, and woven, and done cooking.""I can speak just as you and mother speak.""Well, then, I really don't know what it is," the girl said,
laughing."Time will show; but I'm afraid you've already got too many
thoughts."so you always say; I have no thoughts;" and she
wept."Ah, you're a wind-mill, that you are.""No; but now _I_ say it."Now the girl laughed; but after a while she said gravely, "It's wrong
of you to say I'm nothing.""Dear me, when you said so yourself!""Nay; I won't be nothing."Again she laughed; but after a while she said in a sad tone, "The
Clergyman never used to make a fool of me in this way.""No; but he _did_ make a fool of you."well, you've never been so kind to me as he was.""No; and if I had I should have spoiled you.""Well, sour milk can never become sweet.""It may when it is boiled to whey.""Such a long-winded woman as that Clergyman's lady, I never met with
in all my live-long days," interposed a sharp quick voice."Now, make
haste, Baard; get up and push off the boat, or we sha'n't get home
to-night.The lady wished me to take care that Eli's feet were kept
dry.Dear me, she must attend to that herself!Then she said Eli must
take a walk every morning for the sake of her health!Well, get up, Baard, and push off the boat;
I have to make the dough this evening.""The chest hasn't come yet," he said, without rising."But the chest isn't to come; it's to be left there till next Sunday.Well, Eli, get up; take your bundle, and come on.Away she went, followed by the girl.Arne then heard the same voice say from the shore
below."Have you looked after the plug in the boat?""Yes, it's put in;" and then Arne heard her drive it in with a scoop."But do get up, Baard; I suppose we're not going to stay here all
night?"But bless you, dear, haven't I told you it's to be left there till
next Sunday?""Here it comes," Baard said, as the rattling of a cart was heard."Why, I said it was to be left till next Sunday.""I said we were to take it with us."Away went the wife to the cart, and carried the bundle and other
small things down into the boat.Then Baard rose, went up, and took
down the chest himself.But a girl with streaming hair, and a straw bonnet came running after
the cart: it was the Clergyman's daughter."Mathilde, Mathilde," was answered; and the two girls ran towards
each other.They met on the hill, embraced each other and wept.Then
Mathilde took out something which she had set down on the grass: it
was a bird in a cage."You shall have Narrifas," she said; "mamma wishes you to have it
too; you shall have Narrifas... you really shall--and then you'll
think of me--and very often row over to me;" and again they wept
much.Arne heard the mother
say from the shore below."But I'll go with you," said Mathilde.and, with their arms round each other's neck, they ran
down to the landing-place.In a few minutes Arne saw the boat on the water, Eli standing high in
the stern, holding the bird-cage, and waving her hand; while Mathilde
sat alone on the stones of the landing-place weeping.She remained sitting there watching the boat as long as it was on the
water; and so did Arne.The distance across the lake to the red
houses was but short; the boat soon passed into the dark shadows, and
he saw it come ashore.Then he saw in the water the reflections of
the three who had just landed, and in it he followed them on their
way to the red houses till they reached the finest of them; there he
saw them go in; the mother first, next, the father, and last, the
daughter.But soon the daughter came out again, and seated herself
before the storehouse; perhaps to look across to the parsonage, over
which the sun was laying its last rays.But Mathilde had already
gone, and it was only Arne who was sitting there looking at Eli in
the water."I wonder whether she sees me," he thought....

He rose and went away.The sun had set, but the summer night was
light and the sky clear blue.The mist from the lake and the valleys
rose, and lay along the mountain-sides, but their peaks were left
clear, and stood looking over to each other.He went higher: the
water lay black and deep below; the distant valley shortened and drew
nearer the lake; the mountains came nearer the eye and gathered in
clumps; the sky itself was lower; and all things became friendly and
familiar."Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
            Her lover to meet.He sang till it sounded afar away,
            'Good-day, good-day,'
    While blithesome birds were singing on every blooming spray.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."She wove him a wreath of corn-flowers blue:
            'Mine eyes so true.'He took it, but soon away it was flung:
            'Farewell!'he sung;
    And still with merry singing across the fields he sprung.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a chain: 'Oh keep it with care;
            'Tis made of my hair.'She yielded him then, in an hour of bliss,
            Her pure first kiss;
    But he blushed as deeply as she the while her lips met his
            On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath with a lily-band:
            'My true right hand.'She wove him another with roses aglow:
            'My left hand now.'He took them gently from her, but blushes dyed his brow.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove him a wreath of all flowers round:
            'All I have found.'She wept, but she gathered and wove on still:
            'Take all you will.'Without a word he took it, and fled across the hill.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on bewildered and out of breath:
            'My bridal wreath.'She wove till her fingers aweary had grown:
            'Now put it on:'
    But when she turned to see him, she found that he had gone.On Midsummer-day, &c."She wove on in haste, as for life or death,
            Her bridal wreath;
        But the Midsummer sun no longer shone,
            And the flowers were gone;
    But though she had no flowers, wild fancy still wove on.On Midsummer-day
            There is dancing and play;
    But now I know not whether she weaves her wreath or nay."Arne had of late been happier, both when at home and when out among
people.In the winter, when he had not work enough on his own place,
he went out in the parish and did carpentry; but every Saturday night
he came home to the mother; and went with her to church on Sunday, or
read the sermon to her; and then returned in the evening to his place
of work.But soon, through going more among people, his wish to
travel awoke within him again; and just after his merriest moods, he
would often lie trying to finish his song, "Over the mountains high,"
and altering it for about the twentieth time.He often thought of
Christian, who seemed to have so utterly forgotten him, and who, in
spite of his promise, had not sent him even a single letter.Once,
the remembrance of Christian came upon him so powerfully that he
thoughtlessly spoke of him to the mother; she gave no answer, but
turned away and went out.There was living in the parish a jolly man named Ejnar Aasen.When he
was twenty years old he broke his leg, and from that time he had
walked with the support of a stick; but wherever he appeared limping
along on that stick, there was always merriment going on.The man was
rich, and he used the greater part of his wealth in doing good; but
he did it all so quietly that few people knew anything about it.There was a large nut-wood on his property; and on one of the
brightest mornings in harvest-time, he always had a nutting-party of
merry girls at his house, where he had abundance of good cheer for
them all day, and a dance in the evening.He was the godfather of
most of the girls; for he was the godfather of half of the parish.All the children called him Godfather, and from them everybody else
had learned to call him so, too.He and Arne knew each other well; and he liked Arne for the sake of
his songs.Now he invited him to the nutting-party; but Arne
declined: he was not used to girls' company, he said."Then you had
better get used to it," answered Godfather.So Arne came to the party, and was nearly the only young man among
the many girls.Such fun as was there, Arne had never seen before in
all his life; and one thing which especially astonished him was, that
the girls laughed for nothing at all: if three laughed, then five
would laugh just because those three laughed.Altogether, they
behaved as if they had lived with each other all their lives; and yet
there were several of them who had never met before that very day.When they caught the bough which they jumped after, they laughed, and
when they did not catch it they laughed also; when they did not find
any nuts, they laughed because they found none; and when they did
find some, they also laughed.They fought for the nutting-hook: those
who got it laughed, and those who did not get it laughed also.Godfather limped after them, trying to beat them with his stick, and
making all the mischief he was good for; those he hit, laughed
because he hit them, and those he missed, laughed because he missed
them.But the whole lot laughed at Arne because he was so grave; and
when at last he could not help laughing, they all laughed again
because he laughed.Then the whole party seated themselves on a large hill; the girls in
a circle, and Godfather in the middle.The sun was scorching hot, but
they did not care the least for it, but sat cracking nuts, giving
Godfather the kernels, and throwing the shells and husks at each
other.Godfather'sh'shed at them, and, as far as he could reach,
beat them with his stick; for he wanted to make them be quiet and
tell tales.But to stop their noise seemed just about as easy as to
stop a carriage running down a hill.Godfather began to tell a tale,
however.At first many of them would not listen; they knew his
stories already; but soon they all listened attentively; and before
they thought of it, they set off tale-telling themselves at full
gallop.Though they had just been so noisy, their tales, to Arne's
great surprise, were very earnest: they ran principally upon love."You, Aasa, know a good tale, I remember from last year," said
Godfather, turning to a plump girl with a round, good-natured face,
who sat plaiting the hair of a younger sister, whose head lay in her
lap."But perhaps several know it already," answered Aasa."Never mind, tell it," they begged."Very well, I'll tell it without any more persuading," she answered;
and then, plaiting her sister's hair all the while, she told and
sang:--

"There was once a grown-up lad who tended cattle, and who often drove
them upwards near a broad stream.On one side was a high steep cliff,
jutting out so far over the stream that when he was upon it he could
talk to any one on the opposite side; and all day he could see a girl
over there tending cattle, but he couldn't go to her.'Now, tell me thy name, thou girl that art sitting
    Up there with thy sheep, so busily knitting,'

he asked over and over for many days, till one day at last there came
an answer:--

   'My name floats about like a duck in wet weather;
    Come over, thou boy in the cap of brown leather.'"This left the lad no wiser than he was before; and he thought he
wouldn't mind her any further.This, however, was much more easily
thought than done, for drive his cattle whichever way he would, it
always, somehow or other, led to that same high steep cliff.Then the
lad grew frightened; and he called over to her--

   'Well, who is your father, and where are you biding?On the road to the church I have ne'er seen you riding.'"The lad asked this because he half believed she was a huldre.[3]

 [3] "Over the whole of Norway, the tradition is current of a
 supernatural being that dwells in the forests and mountains, called
 Huldre or Hulla.She appears like a beautiful woman, and is usually
 clad in a blue petticoat and a white snood; but unfortunately has a
 long tail, which she anxiously tries to conceal when she is among
 people.She is fond of cattle, particularly brindled, of which she
 possesses a beautiful and thriving stock.She was once at a merrymaking, where every one was desirous of
 dancing with the handsome, strange damsel; but in the midst of the
 mirth, a young man, who had just begun a dance with her, happened
 to cast his eye on her tail.Immediately guessing whom he had got
 for a partner, he was not a little terrified; but, collecting
 himself, and unwilling to betray her, he merely said to her when
 the dance was over, 'Fair maid, you will lose your garter.'She
 instantly vanished, but afterwards rewarded the silent and
 considerate youth with beautiful presents and a good breed of
 cattle.The idea entertained of this being is not everywhere the
 same, but varies considerably in different parts of Norway.In some
 places she is described as a handsome female when seen in front,
 but is hollow behind, or else blue; while in others she is known by
 the name of Skogmerte, and is said to be blue, but clad in a green
 petticoat, and probably corresponds to the Swedish Skogsnyfoor.Her
 song--a sound often heard among the mountains--is said to be hollow
 and mournful, differing therein from the music of the subterranean
 beings, which is described by earwitnesses as cheerful and
 fascinating.But she is not everywhere regarded as a solitary wood
 nymph.Huldremen and Huldrefolk are also spoken of, who live
 together in the mountains, and are almost identical with the
 subterranean people.In Hardanger the Huldre people are always clad
 in green, but their cattle are blue, and may be taken when a
 grown-up person casts his belt over them.The Huldres take possession of the forsaken pasture-spots in
 the mountains, and invite people into their mounds, where
 delightful music is to be heard."--_Thorpe's Northern Mythology._

   'My house is burned down, and my father is drowned,
    And the road to the church-hill I never have found.'"This again left the lad no wiser than he was before.In the daytime
he kept hovering about the cliff; and at night he dreamed she danced
with him, and lashed him with a big cow's tail whenever he tried to
catch her.Soon he could neither sleep nor work; and altogether the
lad got in a very poor way.Then once more he called from the cliff--

   'If thou art a huldre, then pray do not spell me;
    If thou art a maiden, then hasten to tell me.'"But there came no answer; and so he was sure she was a huldre.He
gave up tending cattle; but it was all the same; wherever he went,
and whatever he did, he was all the while thinking of the beautiful
huldre who blew on the horn.Soon he could bear it no longer; and one
moonlight evening when all were asleep, he stole away into the
forest, which stood there all dark at the bottom, but with its
tree-tops bright in the moonbeams.He sat down on the cliff, and
called--

   'Run forward, my huldre; my love has o'ercome me;
    My life is a burden; no longer hide from me.'"The lad looked and looked; but she didn't appear.Then he heard
something moving behind him; he turned round and saw a big black
bear, which came forward, squatted on the ground and looked at him.But he ran away from the cliff and through the forest as fast as his
legs could carry him: if the bear followed him, he didn't know, for
he didn't turn round till he lay safely in bed."'It was one of her herd,' the lad thought; 'it isn't worth while to
go there any more;' and he didn't go."Then, one day, while he was chopping wood, a girl came across the
yard who was the living picture of the huldre: but when she drew
nearer, he saw it wasn't she.Then he saw
the girl coming back, and again while she was at a distance she
seemed to be the huldre, and he ran to meet her; but as soon as he
came near, he saw it wasn't she."After this, wherever the lad was--at church at dances, or any other
parties--the girl was, too; and still when at a distance she seemed
to be the huldre, and when near she was somebody else.Then he asked
her whether she was the huldre or not, but she only laughed at him.'One may as well leap into it as creep into it,' the lad thought; and
so he married the girl."But the lad had hardly done this before he ceased to like the girl:
when he was away from her he longed for her; but when he was with her
he yearned for some one he did not see.So the lad behaved very badly
to his wife; but she suffered in silence."Then one day when he was out looking for his horses, he came again
to the cliff; and he sat down and called out--

   'Like fairy moonlight, to me thou seemest;
    Like Midsummer-fires, from afar thou gleamest.'"He felt that it did him good to sit there; and afterwards he went
whenever things were wrong at home."But one day when he was sitting there, he saw the huldre sitting all
alive on the other side blowing her horn.He called over--

   'Ah, dear, art thou come!"Then she answered--

   'Away from thy mind the dreams I am blowing;
    Thy rye is all rotting for want of mowing.'"But then the lad felt frightened and went home again.Ere long,
however, he grew so tired of his wife that he was obliged to go to
the forest again, and he sat down on the cliff.Then was sung over to
him--

   'I dreamed thou wast here; ho, hasten to bind me!No; not over there, but behind you will find me.'"The lad jumped up and looked around him, and caught a glimpse of a
green petticoat just slipping away between the shrubs.He followed,
and it came to a hunting all through the forest.So swift-footed as
that huldre, no human creature could be: he flung steel over her
again and again, but still she ran on just as well as ever.But soon
the lad saw, by her pace, that she was beginning to grow tired,
though he saw, too, by her shape, that she could be no other than the
huldre.'Now,' he thought, you'll be mine easily;' and he caught hold
on her so suddenly and roughly that they both fell, and rolled down
the hills a long way before they could stop themselves.Then the
huldre laughed till it seemed to the lad the mountains sang again.He
took her upon his knee; and so beautiful she was, that never in all
his life he had seen any one like her: exactly like her, he thought
his wife should have been.'Ah, who are you who are so beautiful?'he
asked, stroking her cheek.'I'm your wife,' she
answered."The girls laughed much at that tale, and ridiculed the lad.But
Godfather asked Arne if he had listened well to it."Well, now I'll tell you something," said a little girl with a little
round face, and a very little nose:--

"Once there was a little lad who wished very much to woo a little
girl.They were both grown up; but yet they were very little.And the
lad couldn't in any way muster courage to ask her to have him.He
kept close to her when they came home from church; but, somehow or
other, their chat was always about the weather.He went over to her
at the dancing-parties, and nearly danced her to death; but still he
couldn't bring himself to say what he wanted.'You must learn to
write,' he said to himself; 'then you'll manage matters.'And the lad
set to writing; but he thought it could never be done well enough;
and so he wrote a whole year round before he dared do his letter.Now, the thing was to get it given to her without anybody seeing.He
waited till one day when they were standing all by themselves behind
the church.'I've got a letter for you,' said the lad.'But I can't
read writing,' the girl answered."Then he went to service at the girl's father's house; and he used to
keep hovering round her all day long.Once he had nearly brought
himself to speak; in fact, he had already opened his mouth; but then
a big fly flew in it.'Well, I hope, at any rate, nobody else will
come to take her away,' the lad thought; but nobody came to take her,
because she was so very little."By-and-by, however, some one _did_ come, and he, too, was little.The lad could see very well what he wanted; and when he and the girl
went up-stairs together, the lad placed himself at the key-hole.Then
he who was inside made his offer.'Bad luck to me, I, codfish, who
didn't make haste!'He who was inside kissed the
girl just on her lips----.'No doubt that tasted nice,' the lad
thought.But he who was inside took the girl on his lap.Then the
girl heard him and went to the door.'What do you want, you nasty
boy?'said she, 'why can't you leave me alone?'--'I?I only wanted to
ask you to have me for your bridesman.'--'No; that, my brother's
going to be,' the girl answered, banging the door to.The girls laughed very much at this tale, and afterwards pelted each
other with husks.Then Godfather wished Eli Boeen to tell something."Well, she might tell what she had told him on the hill, the last
time he came to see her parents, when she gave him the new garters.Eli laughed very much; and it was some time before she would tell it:
however, she did at last,--

"A lad and a girl were once walking together on a road.'Ah, look at
that thrush that follows us!''It follows _me_,' said
the lad.'It's just as likely to be _me_,' the girl answered.'That,
we'll soon find out,' said the lad; 'you go that way, while I go
this, and we'll meet up yonder.''Well, didn't it follow
me?''No; it followed me,' answered the
girl.They went together again for some
distance, but then there was only one thrush; and the lad thought it
flew on his side, but the girl thought it flew on hers.'Devil a bit,
I care for that thrush,' said the lad."But no sooner had they said this, than the thrush flew away.'It was
on _your_ side, it was,' said the lad.'Thank you,' answered the
girl; 'but I clearly saw it was on _your_ side.--But see!'Indeed, it's on _my_ side,' the lad exclaimed.Then
the girl got angry: 'Ah, well, I wish I may never stir if I go with
you any longer!'"Then the thrush, too, left the lad; and he felt so dull that he
called out to the girl, 'Is the thrush with you?'--'No; isn't it with
you?'--'Ah, no; you must come here again, and then perhaps it will
follow you.'"The girl came; and she and the lad walked on together, hand in
hand.'Quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the girl's side;
'quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on the lad's side; 'quitt,
quitt, quitt, quitt!'sounded on every side; and when they looked
there were a hundred thousand million thrushes all round them.said the girl, looking up at the lad.All the girls thought this was such a nice tale.Then Godfather said they must tell what they had dreamed last night,
and he would decide who had dreamed the nicest things.And then there was no end of tittering and whispering.But soon one
after another began to think she had such a nice dream last night;
and then others thought it could not possibly be so nice as what they
had dreamed; and at last they all got a great mind for telling their
dreams.Yet they must not be told aloud, but to one only, and that
one must by no means be Godfather.Arne had all this time been
sitting quietly a little lower down the hill, and so the girls
thought they dared tell their dreams to him.Then Arne seated himself under a hazel-bush; and Aasa, the girl who
had told the first tale, came over to him.She hesitated a while, but
then began,--

"I dreamed I was standing by a large lake.Then I saw one walking on
the water, and it was one whose name I will not say.He stepped into
a large water-lily, and sat there singing.But I launched out upon
one of the large leaves of the lily which lay floating on the water;
for on it I would row over to him.But no sooner had I come upon the
leaf than it began to sink with me, and I became much frightened, and
I wept.Then he came rowing along in the water-lily, and lifted me
up to him; and we rowed all over the whole lake.Next came the little girl who had told the tale about the little
lad,--

"I dreamed I had caught a little bird, and I was so pleased with it,
and I thought I wouldn't let it loose till I came home in our room.But there I dared not let it loose, for I was afraid father and
mother might tell me to let it go again.So I took it up-stairs; but
I could not let it loose there, either, for the cat was lurking
about.Then I didn't know what in the world to do; yet I took it into
the barn.Dear me, there were so many cracks, I was afraid it might
go away!Well, then I went down again into the yard; and there, it
seemed to me some one was standing whose name I will not say.He
stood playing with a big, big dog.'I would rather play with that
bird of yours,' he said, and drew very near to me.But then it seemed
to me I began running away; and both he and the big dog ran after me
all round the yard; but then mother opened the front door, pulled me
hastily in, and banged the door after me.The lad, however, stood
laughing outside, with his face against the window-pane.'Look,
here's the bird,' he said; and, only think, he had my bird out there!Then came the girl who had told about the thrushes--Eli, they called
her.She was laughing so much that she could not speak for some time;
but at last she began,--

"I had been looking forward with very much pleasure to our nutting in
the wood to-day; and so last night I dreamed I was sitting here on
the hill.The sun shone brightly; and I had my lap full of nuts.But
there came a little squirrel among them, and it sat on its hind-legs
and ate them all up.Afterwards some more dreams were told him; and then the girls would
have him say which was the nicest.Of course, he must have plenty of
time for consideration; and meanwhile Godfather and the whole flock
went down to the house, leaving Arne to follow.They skipped down the
hill, and when they came to the plain went all in a row singing
towards the house.Arne sat alone on the hill, listening to the singing.Strong sunlight
fell on the group of girls, and their white bodices shone bright, as
they went dancing over the meadows, every now and then clasping each
other round the waist; while Godfather limped behind, threatening
them with a stick because they trod down his hay.Arne thought no
more of the dreams, and soon he no longer looked after the girls.His
thoughts went floating far away beyond the valley, like the fine
air-threads, while he remained behind on the hill, spinning; and
before he was aware of it he had woven a close web of sadness.More
than ever, he longed to go away.he said to himself; "surely, I've been
lingering long enough now!"He promised himself that he would speak
to the mother about it as soon as he reached home, however it might
turn out.With greater force than ever, his thoughts turned to his song, "Over
the mountains high;" and never before had the words come so swiftly,
or linked themselves into rhyme so easily; they seemed almost like
girls sitting in a circle on the brow of a hill.He had a piece of
paper with him, and placing it upon his knee, he wrote down the
verses as they came.When he had finished the song, he rose like one
freed from a burden.He felt unwilling to see any one, and went
homewards by the way through the wood, though he knew he should then
have to walk during the night.The first time he stopped to rest on
the way, he put his hand to his pocket to take out the song,
intending to sing it aloud to himself through the wood; but he found
he had left it behind at the place where it was composed.One of the girls went on the hill to look for him; she did not find
him, but she found his song.X.

LOOSENING THE WEATHER-VANE.To speak to the mother about going away, was more easily thought of
than done.He spoke again about Christian, and those letters which
had never come; but then the mother went away, and for days
afterwards he thought her eyes looked red and swollen.He noticed,
too, that she then got nicer food for him than usual; and this gave
him another sign of her state of mind with regard to him.One day he went to cut fagots in a wood which bordered upon another
belonging to the parsonage, and through which the road ran.Just
where he was going to cut his fagots, people used to come in autumn
to gather whortleberries.He had laid aside his axe to take off his
jacket, and was just going to begin work, when two girls came walking
along with a basket to gather berries.He used generally to hide
himself rather than meet girls, and he did so now."Well, but, then, don't go any farther; here are many basketfuls.""I thought I heard a rustling among the trees!"The girls rushed towards each other, clasped each other round the
waist, and for a little while stood still, scarcely drawing breath."It's nothing, I dare say; come, let's go on picking.""It was nice you came to the parsonage to-day, Eli.Haven't you
anything to tell me?""Yes; I've been to see Godfather.""Well, you've told me that; but haven't you anything to tell me about
_him_--you know who?""Indeed, he has: father and mother pretended to know nothing of it;
but I went up-stairs and hid myself.""Yes; I believe father told him where I was; he's always so tiresome
now.""And so he came there?--Sit down, sit down; here, near me."Yes; but he didn't say much, for he was so bashful.""Tell me what he said, every word; pray, every word!"'You know what I want to say to you,' he said, sitting down
beside me on the chest.""I wished very much to get loose again; but he wouldn't let me.'Dear
Eli,' he said----" She laughed, and the other one laughed, too.And then both laughed together, "Ha, ha, ha, ha!"At last the laughing came to an end, and they were both quiet for a
while.Then the one who had first spoken asked in a low voice,
"Wasn't it strange he took you round your waist?"Either the other girl did not answer that question, or she answered
in so low a voice that it could not be heard; perhaps she only
answered by a smile."Didn't your father or your mother say anything afterwards?"asked
the first girl, after a pause."Father came up and looked at me; but I turned away from him because
he laughed at me.""No, she didn't say anything; but she wasn't so strict as usual.""Well, you've done with him, I think?""Was it thus he took you round your waist?""Well, then;--it was thus...."

"Eli?""Do you think there will ever be anybody come in that way to me?"Then they laughed again; and there was much whispering and tittering.Soon the girls went away; they had not seen either Arne or the axe
and jacket, and he was glad of it.A few days after, he gave Opplands-Knut a little farm on Kampen."You shall not be lonely any longer," Arne said.That winter Arne went to the parsonage for some time to do carpentry;
and both the girls were often there together.When Arne saw them, he
often wondered who it might be that now came to woo Eli Boeen.One day he had to drive for the clergyman's daughter and Eli; he
could not understand a word they said, though he had very quick ears.Sometimes Mathilde spoke to him; and then Eli always laughed and hid
her face.Mathilde asked him if it was true that he could make
verses."No," he said quickly; then they both laughed; and chattered
and laughed again.He felt vexed; and afterwards when he met them
seemed not to take any notice of them.Once he was sitting in the servants' hall while a dance was going on,
and Mathilde and Eli both came to see it.They stood together in a
corner, disputing about something; Eli would not do it, but Mathilde
would, and she at last gained her point.Then they both came over to
Arne, courtesied, and asked him if he could dance.He said he could
not; and then both turned aside and ran away, laughing.In fact, they
were always laughing, Arne thought; and he became brave.But soon
after, he got the clergyman's foster-son, a boy of about twelve, to
teach him to dance, when no one was by.Eli had a little brother of the same age as the clergyman's
foster-son.These two boys were playfellows; and Arne made sledges,
snow-shoes and snares for them; and often talked to them about their
sisters, especially about Eli.One day Eli's brother brought Arne a
message that he ought to make his hair a little smoother."Eli did; but she told me not to say it was she."A few days after, Arne sent word that Eli ought to laugh a little
less.The boy brought back word that Arne ought by all means to laugh
a little more.Eli's brother once asked Arne to give him something that he had
written.He complied, without thinking any more about the matter.But
in a few days after, the boy, thinking to please Arne, told him that
Eli and Mathilde liked his writing very much."Where, then, have they seen any of it?""Well, it was for them, I asked for some of it the other day."Then Arne asked the boys to bring him something their sisters had
written.They did so; and he corrected the errors in the writing with
his carpenter's pencil, and asked the boys to lay it in some place
where their sisters might easily find it.Soon after, he found the
paper in his jacket pocket; and at the foot was written, "Corrected
by a conceited fellow."The next day, Arne completed his work at the parsonage, and returned
home.So gentle as he was that winter, the mother had never seen him,
since that sad time just after the father's death.He read the sermon
to her, accompanied her to church, and was in every way very kind.But she knew only too well that one great reason for his increased
kindness was, that he meant to go away when spring came.Then one day
a message came from Boeen, asking him to go there to do carpentry.Arne started, and, apparently without thinking of what he said,
replied that he would come.But no sooner had the messenger left than
the mother said, "You may well be astonished!"Well, is there anything strange in that?"Arne asked, without
looking at her."And, why not from Boeen, as well as any other place?""From Boeen and Birgit Boeen!--Baard, who made your father a <DW36>,
and all only for Birgit's sake!"exclaimed Arne; "was that Baard Boeen?"The whole of the father's
life seemed unrolled before them, and at that moment they saw the
black thread which had always run through it.Then they began talking
about those grand days of his, when old Eli Boeen had himself offered
him his daughter Birgit, and he had refused her: they passed on
through his life till the day when his spine had been broken; and
they both agreed that Baard's fault was the less.Still, it was he
who had made the father a <DW36>; he, it was."Have I not even yet done with father?"Arne thought; and determined
at the same moment that he would go to Boeen.As he went walking, with his saw on his shoulder, over the ice
towards Boeen, it seemed to him a beautiful place.The dwelling-house
always seemed as if it was fresh painted; and--perhaps because he
felt a little cold--it just then looked to him very sheltered and
comfortable.He did not, however, go straight in, but went round by
the cattle-house, where a flock of thick-haired goats stood in the
snow, gnawing the bark off some fir twigs.A shepherd's dog ran
backwards and forwards on the barn steps, barking as if the devil was
coming to the house; but when Arne went to him, he wagged his tail
and allowed himself to be patted.The kitchen door at the upper end
of the house was often opened, and Arne looked over there every time;
but he saw no one except the milkmaid, carrying some pails, or the
cook, throwing something to the goats.In the barn the threshers
were hard at work; and to the left, in front of the woodshed, a lad
stood chopping fagots, with many piles of them behind him.Arne laid away his saw and went into the kitchen: the floor was
strewed with white sand and chopped juniper leaves; copper kettles
shone on the walls; china and earthenware stood in rows upon the
shelves; and the servants were preparing the dinner."Step into the sitting-room," said one of the servants,
pointing to an inner door with a brass knob.He went in: the room was
brightly painted--the ceiling, with clusters of roses; the cupboards,
with red, and the names of the owners in black letters; the bedstead,
also with red, bordered with blue stripes.Beside the stove, a
broad-shouldered, mild-looking man, with long light hair, sat hooping
some tubs; and at the large table, a slender, tall woman, in a
close-fitting dress and linen cap, sat sorting some corn into two
heaps: no one else was in the room."Good day, and a blessing on the work," said Arne, taking off his
cap.Both looked up; and the man smiled and asked who it was."I am
he who has come to do carpentry."The man smiled still more, and said, while he leaned forward again to
his work, "Oh, all right, Arne Kampen."exclaimed the wife, staring down at the floor.The man
looked up quickly, and said, smiling once more, "A son of Nils, the
tailor;" and then he began working again.Soon the wife rose, went to the shelf, turned from it to the
cupboard, once more turned away, and, while rummaging for something
in the table drawer, she asked, without looking up, "Is _he_ going to
work _here_?""Yes, that he is," the husband answered, also without looking up."Nobody has asked you to sit down, it seems," he added, turning to
Arne, who then took a seat.The wife went out, and the husband
continued working: and so Arne asked whether he, too, might begin.The wife did not return; but next time the door opened, it was Eli
who entered.At first, she appeared not to see Arne, but when he
rose to meet her she turned half round and gave him her hand; yet
she did not look at him.They exchanged a few words, while the
father worked on.Eli was slender and upright, her hands were small,
with round wrists, her hair was braided, and she wore a dress with a
close-fitting bodice.She laid the table for dinner: the laborers
dined in the next room; but Arne, with the family."No; she's up-stairs, weighing wool.""Yes; but she says she won't have anything.""She wouldn't let me make a fire."After dinner, Arne began to work; and in the evening he again sat
with the family.The wife and Eli sewed, while the husband employed
himself in some trifling work, and Arne helped him.They worked on in
silence above an hour; for Eli, who seemed to be the one who usually
did the talking, now said nothing.Arne thought with dismay how often
it was just so in his own home; and yet he had never felt it till
now.At last, Eli seemed to think she had been silent quite long
enough, and, after drawing a deep breath, she burst out laughing.Then the father laughed; and Arne felt it was ridiculous and began,
too.Afterwards they talked about several things, soon the
conversation was principally between Arne and Eli, the father now and
then putting in a word edgewise.But once after Arne had been
speaking at some length, he looked up, and his eyes met those of the
mother, Birgit, who had laid down her work, and sat gazing at him.Then she went on with her work again; but the next word he spoke made
her look up once more.Bedtime drew near, and they all went to their own rooms.Arne thought
he would take notice of the dream he had the first night in a fresh
place; but he could see no meaning in it.During the whole day he had
talked very little with the husband; yet now in the night he dreamed
of no one in the house but him.The last thing was, that Baard was
sitting playing at cards with Nils, the tailor.The latter looked
very pale and angry; but Baard was smiling, and he took all the
tricks.Arne stayed at Boeen several days; and a great deal was done, but very
little said.Not only the people in the parlor, but also the
servants, the housemen, everybody about the place, even the women,
were silent.In the yard was an old dog which barked whenever a
stranger came near; but if any of the people belonging to the place
heard him, they always said "Hush!"and then he went away, growling,
and lay down.At Arne's own home was a large weather-vane, and here
was one still larger which he particularly noticed because it did not
turn.It shook whenever the wind was high, as though it wished to
turn; and Arne stood looking at it so long that he felt at last he
must climb up to unloose it.It was not frozen fast, as he thought:
but a stick was fixed against it to prevent it from turning.He took
the stick out and threw it down; Baard was just passing below, and it
struck him."Leave it alone; it makes a wailing noise when it turns.""Well, I think even that's better than silence," said Arne, seating
himself astride on the ridge of the roof.Baard looked up at Arne,
and Arne down at Baard.Then Baard smiled and said, "He who must wail
when he speaks had better he silent."Words sometimes haunt us long after they were uttered, especially
when they were last words.So Baard's words followed Arne as he came
down from the roof in the cold, and they were still with him when he
went into the sitting-room in the evening.It was twilight; and Eli
stood at the window, looking away over the ice which lay bright in
the moonlight.Arne went to the other window, and looked out also.Indoors it was warm and quiet; outdoors it was cold, and a sharp wind
swept through the vale, bending the branches of the trees, and making
their shadows creep trembling on the snow.A light shone over from
the parsonage, then vanished, then appeared again, taking various
shapes and colors, as a distant light always seems to do when one
looks at it long and intently.Opposite, the mountain stood dark,
with deep shadow at its foot, where a thousand fairy tales hovered;
but with its snowy upper plains bright in the moonlight.The stars
were shining, and northern lights were flickering in one quarter of
the sky, but they did not spread.A little way from the window, down
towards the water, stood some trees, whose shadows kept stealing over
to each other; but the tall ash stood alone, writing on the snow.All was silent, save now and then, when a long wailing sound was
heard."It's the weather-vane," said Eli; and after a little while she added
in a lower tone, as if to herself, "it must have come unfastened."But Arne had been like one who wished to speak and could not.Now he
said, "Do you remember that tale about the thrushes?""It was you who told it, indeed."I often think there's something that sings when all is still," she
said, in a voice so soft and low that he felt as if he heard it now
for the first time."It is the good within our own souls," he said.She looked at him as if she thought that answer meant too much; and
they both stood silent a few moments.Then she asked, while she wrote
with her finger on the window-pane, "Have you made any songs lately?"He blushed; but she did not see it, and so she asked once more, "How
do you manage to make songs?""I store up the thoughts that other people let slip."She was silent for a long while; perhaps thinking she might have had
some thoughts fit for songs, but had let them slip."How strange it is," she said, at last, as though to herself, and
beginning to write again on the window-pane."I made a song the first time I had seen you.""Behind the parsonage, that evening you went away from there;--I saw
you in the water."She laughed, and was quiet for a while.Arne had never done such a thing before, but he repeated the song
now:

   "Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet
        Her lover to meet," &c.[4]

 [4] As on page 68.Eli listened attentively, and stood silent long after he had
finished.At last she exclaimed, "Ah, what a pity for her!""I feel as if I had not made that song myself," he said; and then
stood like her, thinking over it."But that won't be my fate, I hope," she said, after a pause."No; I was thinking rather of myself.""I don't know; I felt so then."The next day, when Arne came into the room to dinner, he went over to
the window.Outdoors it was dull and foggy, but indoors, warm and
comfortable; and on the window-pane was written with a finger, "Arne,
Arne, Arne," and nothing but "Arne," over and over again: it was at
that window, Eli stood the evening before.Next day, Arne came into the room and said he had heard in the yard
that the clergyman's daughter, Mathilde, had just gone to the town;
as she thought, for a few days, but as her parents intended, for a
year or two.Eli had heard nothing of this before, and now she fell
down fainting.Arne had never seen any one faint, and he was much
frightened.He ran for the maids; they ran for the parents, who came
hurrying in; and there was a disturbance all over the house, and the
dog barked on the barn steps.Soon after, when Arne came in again,
the mother was kneeling at the bedside, while the father supported
Eli's drooping head.The maids were running about--one for water,
another for hartshorn which was in the cupboard, while a third
unfastened her jacket.the mother said; "I see it was wrong in us not to
tell her; it was you, Baard, who would have it so; God help you!""I wished to tell her, indeed; but nothing's to
be as I wish; God help you!You're always so harsh with her, Baard;
you don't understand her; you don't know what it is to love anybody,
you don't.""She isn't like some others who can
bear sorrow; it quite puts her down, poor slight thing, as she is.Wake up, my child, and we'll be kind to you!wake up, Eli, my own
darling, and don't grieve us so.""You always either talk too much or too little," Baard said, at last,
looking over to Arne, as though he did not wish him to hear such
things, but to leave the room.As, however, the maid-servants stayed,
Arne thought he, too, might stay; but he went over to the window.Soon the sick girl revived so far as to be able to look round and
recognize those about her; but then also memory returned, and she
called wildly for Mathilde, went into hysterics, and sobbed till it
was painful to be in the room.The mother tried to soothe her, and
the father sat down where she could see him; but she pushed them both
from her.she cried; "I don't like you; go away!""Oh, Eli, how can you say you don't like your own parents?"you're unkind to me, and you take away every pleasure from me!"don't say such hard things," said the mother, imploringly."Yes, mother," she exclaimed; "now I _must_ say it!Yes, mother; you
wish to marry me to that bad man; and I won't have him!You shut me
up here, where I'm never happy save when I'm going out!And you take
away Mathilde from me; the only one in the world I love and long for!Oh, God, what will become of me, now Mathilde is gone!""But you haven't been much with her lately," Baard said."What did that matter, so long as I could look over to her from that
window," the poor girl answered, weeping in a childlike way that Arne
had never before seen in any one."Why, you couldn't see her there," said Baard."Still, I saw the house," she answered; and the mother added
passionately, "You don't understand such things, you don't.""Now, I can never again go to the window," said Eli."When I rose in
the morning, I went there; in the evening I sat there in the
moonlight: I went there when I could go to no one else.She writhed in the bed, and went again into hysterics.Baard sat down on a stool a little way from the bed, and continued
looking at her.But Eli did not recover so soon as they expected.Towards evening
they saw she would have a serious illness, which had probably been
coming upon her for some time; and Arne was called to assist in
carrying her up-stairs to her room.She lay quiet and unconscious,
looking very pale.The mother sat by the side of her bed, the father
stood at the foot, looking at her: afterwards he went to his work.So
did Arne; but that night before he went to sleep, he prayed for her;
prayed that she who was so young and fair might be happy in this
world, and that no one might bar away joy from her.The next day when Arne came in, he found the father and mother
sitting talking together: the mother had been weeping.Arne asked how
Eli was; both expected the other to give an answer, and so for some
time none was given, but at last the father said, "Well, she's very
bad to-day."Afterwards Arne heard that she had been raving all night, or, as the
father said, "talking foolery."She had a violent fever, knew no one,
and would not eat, and the parents were deliberating whether they
should send for a doctor.When afterwards they both went to the
sick-room, leaving Arne behind, he felt as if life and death were
struggling together up there, but he was kept outside.In a few days, however, Eli became a little better.But once when the
father was tending her, she took it into her head to have Narrifas,
the bird which Mathilde had given her, set beside the bed.Then Baard
told her that--as was really the case--in the confusion the bird had
been forgotten, and was starved.The mother was just coming in as
Baard was saying this, and while yet standing in the doorway, she
cried out, "Oh, dear me, what a monster you are, Baard, to tell it to
that poor little thing!See, she's fainting again; God forgive you!"When Eli revived she again asked for the bird; said its death was a
bad omen for Mathilde; and wished to go to her: then she fainted
again.Baard stood looking on till she grew so much worse that he
wanted to help, too, in tending her; but the mother pushed him away,
and said she would do all herself.Then Baard gave a long sad look at
both of them, put his cap straight with both hands, turned aside and
went out.Soon after, the Clergyman and his wife came; for the fever
heightened, and grew so violent that they did not know whether it
would turn to life or death.The Clergyman as well as his wife spoke
to Baard about Eli, and hinted that he was too harsh with her; but
when they heard what he had told her about the bird, the Clergyman
plainly told him it was very rough, and said he would have her taken
to his own house as soon as she was well enough to be moved.The
Clergyman's wife would scarcely look at Baard; she wept, and went to
sit with the sick one; then sent for the doctor, and came several
times a day to carry out his directions.Baard went wandering
restlessly about from one place to another in the yard, going
oftenest to those places where he could be alone.There he would
stand still by the hour together; then, put his cap straight and work
again a little.The mother did not speak to him, and they scarcely looked at each
other.He used to go and see Eli several times in the day; he took
off his shoes before he went up-stairs, left his cap outside, and
opened the door cautiously.When he came in, Birgit would turn her
head, but take no notice of him, and then sit just as before,
stooping forwards, with her head on her hands, looking at Eli, who
lay still and pale, unconscious of all that was passing around her.Baard would stand awhile at the foot of the bed and look at them
both, but say nothing: once when Eli moved as though she were waking,
he stole away directly as quietly as he had come.Arne often thought words had been exchanged between man and wife and
parents and child which had been long gathering, and would be long
remembered.He longed to go away, though he wished to know before he
went what would be the end of Eli's illness; but then he thought he
might always hear about her even after he had left; and so he went to
Baard telling him he wished to go home: the work which he came to do
was completed.Baard was sitting outdoors on a chopping-block,
scratching in the snow with a stick: Arne recognized the stick: it
was the one which had fastened the weather-vane."Well, perhaps it isn't worth your while to stay here now; yet I feel
as if I don't like you to go away, either," said Baard, without
looking up.He said no more; neither did Arne; but after a while he
walked away to do some work, taking for granted that he was to remain
at Boeen.Some time after, when he was called to dinner, he saw Baard still
sitting on the block.He went over to him, and asked how Eli was."I think she's very bad to-day," Baard said.Arne felt as if somebody asked him to sit down, and he seated himself
opposite Baard on the end of a felled tree."I've often thought of your father lately," Baard said so
unexpectedly that Arne did not know how to answer."You know, I suppose, what was between us?""Well, you know, as may be expected, only one half of the story, and
think I'm greatly to blame.""You have, I dare say, settled that affair with your God, as surely
as my father has done so," Arne said, after a pause."Well, some people might think so," Baard answered."When I found
this stick, I felt it was so strange that you should come here and
unloose the weather-vane.He had
taken off his cap, and sat silently looking at it."I was about fourteen years old when I became acquainted with your
father, and he was of the same age.He was very wild, and he couldn't
bear any one to be above him in anything.So he always had a grudge
against me because I stood first, and he, second, when we were
confirmed.He often offered to fight me, but we never came to it;
most likely because neither of us felt sure who would beat.And a
strange thing it is, that although he fought every day, no accident
came from it; while the first time I did, it turned out as badly as
could be; but, it's true, I had been wanting to fight long enough."Nils fluttered about all the girls, and they, about him.There was
only one I would have, and her he took away from me at every dance,
at every wedding, and at every party; it was she who is now my
wife.... Often, as I sat there, I felt a great mind to try my
strength upon him for this thing; but I was afraid I should lose, and
I knew if I did, I should lose her, too.Then, when everybody had
gone, I would lift the weights he had lifted, and kick the beam he
had kicked; but the next time he took the girl from me, I was afraid
to meddle with him, although once, when he was flirting with her just
in my face, I went up to a tall fellow who stood by and threw him
against the beam, as if in fun.And Nils grew pale, too, when he saw
it."Even if he had been kind to her; but he was false to her again and
again.I almost believe, too, she loved him all the more every time.I thought now it must either break or
bear.The Lord, too, would not have him going about any longer; and
so he fell a little more heavily than I meant him to do.They sat silent for a while; then Baard went on:

"I once more made my offer.She said neither yes nor no; but I
thought she would like me better afterwards.The
wedding was kept down in the valley, at the house of one of her
aunts, whose property she inherited.We had plenty when we started,
and it has now increased.Our estates lay side by side, and when we
married they were thrown into one, as I always, from a boy, thought
they might be.But many other things didn't turn out as I expected."He was silent for several minutes; and Arne thought he wept; but he
did not."In the beginning of our married life, she was quiet and very sad.I
had nothing to say to comfort her, and so I was silent.Afterwards,
she began sometimes to take to these fidgeting ways which you have, I
dare say, noticed in her; yet it was a change, and so I said nothing
then, either.But one really happy day, I haven't known ever since I
was married, and that's now twenty years...."

He broke the stick in two pieces; and then sat for a while looking at
them."When Eli grew bigger, I thought she would be happier among strangers
than at home.It was seldom I wished to carry out my own will in
anything, and whenever I did, it generally turned out badly; so it
was in this case.The mother longed after her child, though only the
lake lay between them; and afterwards I saw, too, that Eli's training
at the parsonage was in some ways not the right thing for her; but
then it was too late: now I think she likes neither father nor
mother."He had taken off his cap again; and now his long hair hung down over
his eyes; he stroked it back with both hands, and put on his cap as
if he were going away; but when, as he was about to rise, he turned
towards the house, he checked himself and added, while looking up at
the bed-room window."I thought it better that she and Mathilde shouldn't see each other
to say good-bye: that, too, was wrong.I told her the wee bird was
dead; for it was my fault, and so I thought it better to confess; but
that again was wrong.And so it is with everything: I've always meant
to do for the best, but it has always turned out for the worst; and
now things have come to such a pass that both wife and daughter speak
ill of me, and I'm going here lonely."A servant-girl called out to them that the dinner was becoming cold."I hear the horses neighing; I think somebody has
forgotten them," he said, and went away to the stable to give them
some hay.Arne rose, too; he felt as if he hardly knew whether Baard had been
speaking or not.The mother watched by her night
and day, and never came down-stairs; the father came up as usual,
with his boots off, and leaving his cap outside the door.Arne still
remained at the house.He and the father used to sit together in
the evening; and Arne began to like him much, for Baard was a
well-informed, deep-thinking man, though he seemed afraid of saying
what he knew.In his own way, he, too, enjoyed Arne's company, for
Arne helped his thoughts and told him of things which were new to
him.Eli soon began to sit up part of the day, and as she recovered, she
often took little fancies into her head.Thus, one evening when Arne
was sitting in the room below, singing songs in a clear, loud voice,
the mother came down with a message from Eli, asking him if he would
go up-stairs and sing to her, that she might also hear the words.It
seemed as if he had been singing to Eli all the time, for when the
mother spoke he turned red, and rose as if he would deny having done
so, though no one charged him with it.He soon collected himself,
however, and replied evasively, that he could sing so very little.The mother said it did not seem so when he was alone.He had not seen Eli since the day he helped to
carry her up-stairs; he thought she must be much altered, and he
felt half afraid to see her.But when he gently opened the door and
went in, he found the room quite dark, and he could see no one.He
stopped at the door-way.Eli asked in a clear, low voice."It's Arne Kampen," he said in a gentle, guarded tone, so that his
words might fall softly."It was very kind of you to come.""Won't you sit down, Arne?"she added after a while, and Arne felt
his way to a chair at the foot of the bed."It did me good to hear
you singing; won't you sing a little to me up here?""If I only knew anything you would like."She was silent a while: then she said, "Sing a hymn."And he sang
one: it was the confirmation hymn.When he had finished he heard her
weeping, and so he was afraid to sing again; but in a little while
she said, "Sing one more."And he sang another: it was the one which
is generally sung while the catechumens are standing in the aisle."How many things I've thought over while I've been lying here," Eli
said.He did not know what to answer; and he heard her weeping again
in the dark.A clock that was ticking on the wall warned for
striking, and then struck.Eli breathed deeply several times, as if
she would lighten her breast, and then she said, "One knows so
little; I knew neither father nor mother.I haven't been kind to
them; and now it seems so sad to hear that hymn."When we talk in the darkness, we speak more faithfully than when we
see each other's face; and we also say more."It does one good to hear you talk so," Arne replied, just
remembering what she had said when she was taken ill."If now this had not happened to me,"
she went on, "God only knows how long I might have gone before I
found mother.""She has talked matters over with you lately, then?""Yes, every day; she has done hardly anything else.""Then, I'm sure you've heard many things."They were silent; and Arne had thoughts which he could not utter.Eli
was the first to link their words again."You are said to be like your father.""People say so," he replied evasively.She did not notice the tone of his voice, and so, after a while she
returned to the subject."Sing a song to me... one that you've made yourself.""I have none," he said; for it was not his custom to confess he had
himself composed the songs he sang."I'm sure you have; and I'm sure, too, you'll sing one of them when I
ask you."What he had never done for any one else, he now did for her, as he
sang the following song,--

   "The Tree's early leaf-buds were bursting their brown:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the blossoms have grown,'
    Prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown."The Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung:
    'Shall I take them away?''No; leave them alone
            Till the berries have grown,'
    Said the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung."The Tree bore his fruit in the Midsummer glow:
    Said the girl, 'May I gather thy berries or no?''Yes; all thou canst see;
            Take them; all are for thee,'
    Said the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low."He, too, remained silent after
it, as though he had sung more than he could say.Darkness has a strong influence over those who are sitting in it and
dare not speak: they are never so near each other as then.If she
only turned on the pillow, or moved her hand on the blanket, or
breathed a little more heavily, he heard it."Arne, couldn't you teach me to make songs?""Yes, I have, these last few days; but I can't manage it.""What, then, did you wish to have in them?""Something about my mother, who loved your father so dearly.""Yes, indeed it is; and I have wept over it.""You shouldn't search for subjects; they come of themselves.""Just as other dear things come--unexpectedly.""I wonder, Arne, you're longing to go away;
you who have such a world of beauty within yourself.""Do _you_ know I am longing?"She did not answer, but lay still a few moments as if in thought."Arne, you mustn't go away," she said; and the words came warm to his
heart."Well, sometimes I have less mind to go.""Your mother must love you much, I'm sure."Go over to Kampen, when you're well again."And all at once, he fancied her sitting in the bright room at Kampen,
looking out on the mountains; his chest began to heave, and the blood
rushed to his face."It's warm in here," he said, rising."You must come over to see us oftener; mother's so fond of you.""I should like to come myself, too;... but still I must have some
errand."Eli lay silent for a while, as if she was turning over something in
her mind."I believe," she said, "mother has something to ask you
about."...

They both felt the room was becoming very hot; he wiped his brow, and
he heard her rise in the bed.No sound could be heard either in the
room or down-stairs, save the ticking of the clock on the wall.There
was no moon, and the darkness was deep; when he looked through the
green window, it seemed to him as if he was looking into a wood; when
he looked towards Eli he could see nothing, but his thoughts went
over to her, and then his heart throbbed till he could himself hear
its beating.Before his eyes flickered bright sparks; in his ears
came a rushing sound; still faster throbbed his heart: he felt he
must rise or say something.But then she exclaimed,

"How I wish it were summer!"And he heard again the sound of the
cattle-bells, the horn from the mountains, and the singing from the
valleys; and saw the fresh green foliage, the Swart-water glittering
in the sunbeams, the houses rocking in it, and Eli coming out and
sitting on the shore, just as she did that evening."If it were
summer," she said, "and I were sitting on the hill, I think I could
sing a song."He smiled gladly, and asked, "What would it be about?""About something bright; about--well, I hardly know what myself."He rose in glad excitement; but, on second thoughts,
sat down again."I sang to you when you asked me.""Yes, I know you did; but I can't tell you this; no!"Eli, do you think I would laugh at the little verse you have made?""No, I don't think you would, Arne; but it isn't anything I've made
myself.""Oh, it's by somebody else then?""Then, you can surely say it to me.""No, no, I can't; don't ask me again, Arne!"The last words were almost inaudible; it seemed as if she had hidden
her head under the bedclothes."Eli, now you're not kind to me as I was to you," he said, rising."But, Arne, there's a difference... you don't understand me... but
it was... I don't know... another time... don't be offended with
me, Arne!Though he asked, he did not believe she was.She still wept; he
felt he must draw nearer or go quite away.But he did not know what to say more, and
was silent."It's something--"

His voice trembled, and he stopped."You mustn't refuse... I would ask you...."

"Is it the song?""No... Eli, I wish so much...." He heard her breathing fast and
deeply... "I wish so much... to hold one of your hands."She did not answer; he listened intently--drew nearer, and clasped a
warm little hand which lay on the coverlet.Then steps were heard coming up-stairs; they came nearer and nearer;
the door was opened; and Arne unclasped his hand.It was the mother,
who came in with a light."I think you're sitting too long in the
dark," she said, putting the candlestick on the table.But neither
Eli nor Arne could bear the light; she turned her face to the pillow,
and he shaded his eyes with his hand."Well, it pains a little at
first, but it soon passes off," said the mother.Arne looked on the floor for something which he had not dropped, and
then went down-stairs.The next day, he heard that Eli intended to come down in the
afternoon.He put his tools together, and said good-bye.When she
came down he had gone.MARGIT CONSULTS THE CLERGYMAN.Up between the mountains, the spring comes late.The post, who in
winter passes along the high-road thrice a week, in April passes only
once; and the highlanders know then that outside, the snow is
shovelled away, the ice broken, the steamers are running, and the
plough is struck into the earth.Here, the snow still lies six feet
deep; the cattle low in their stalls; the birds arrive, but feel cold
and hide themselves.Occasionally some traveller arrives, saying he
has left his carriage down in the valley; he brings flowers, which he
examines; he picked them by the wayside.The people watch the advance
of the season, talk over their matters, and look up at the sun and
round about, to see how much he is able to do each day.They scatter
ashes on the snow, and think of those who are now picking flowers.It was at this time of year, old Margit Kampen went one day to the
parsonage, and asked whether she might speak to "father."She was
invited into the study, where the clergyman,--a slender, fair-haired,
gentle-looking man, with large eyes and spectacles,--received her
kindly, recognized her, and asked her to sit down."Is there something the matter with Arne again?"he inquired, as if
Arne had often been a subject of conversation between them.I haven't anything wrong to say about him; but yet
it's so sad," said Margit, looking deeply grieved.I can hardly think he'll even stay with me till
spring comes up here.""But he has promised never to go away from you.""That's true; but, dear me!he must now be his own master; and if his
mind's set upon going away, go, he must."Well, after all, I don't think he will leave you.""Well, perhaps not; but still, if he isn't happy at home?am I then
to have it upon my conscience that I stand in his way?Sometimes I
feel as if I ought even to ask him to leave.""How do you know he is longing now, more than ever?"Since the middle of the winter, he hasn't
worked out in the parish a single day; but he has been to the town
three times, and has stayed a long while each time.He scarcely ever
talks now while he is at work, but he often used to do.He'll sit for
hours alone at the little up-stairs window, looking towards the
ravine, and away over the mountains; he'll sit there all Sunday
afternoon, and often when it's moonlight he sits there till late in
the night.""Yes, of course, he reads and sings to me every Sunday; but he seems
rather in a hurry, save now and then when he gives almost too much of
the thing.""Does he never talk over matters with you then?""Well, yes; but it's so seldom that I sit and weep alone between
whiles.Then I dare say he notices it, for he begins talking, but
it's only about trifles; never about anything serious."The Clergyman walked up and down the room; then he stopped and asked,
"But why, then, don't you talk to him about his matters?"For a long while she gave no answer; she sighed several times, looked
downwards and sideways, doubled up her handkerchief, and at last
said, "I've come here to speak to you, father, about something that's
a great burden on my mind.""Speak freely; it will relieve you.""Yes, I know it will; for I've borne it alone now these many years,
and it grows heavier each year.""Well, what is it, my good Margit?"There was a pause, and then she said, "I've greatly sinned against my
son."The Clergyman came close to her; "Confess it," he
said; "and we will pray together that it may be forgiven."Margit sobbed and wiped her eyes, but began weeping again when she
tried to speak.The Clergyman tried to comfort her, saying she could
not have done anything very sinful, she doubtless was too hard upon
herself, and so on.But Margit continued weeping, and could not begin
her confession till the Clergyman seated himself by her side, and
spoke still more encouragingly to her.Then after a while she began,
"The boy was ill-used when a child; and so he got this mind for
travelling.Then he met with Christian--he who has grown so rich over
there where they dig gold.Christian gave him so many books that he
got quite a scholar; they used to sit together in the long evenings;
and when Christian went away Arne wanted to go after him.But just at
that time, the father died, and the lad promised never to leave me.But I was like a hen that's got a duck's egg to brood; when my
duckling had burst his shell, he would go out on the wide water, and
I was left on the bank, calling after him.If he didn't go away
himself, yet his heart went away in his songs, and every morning I
expected to find his bed empty."Then a letter from foreign parts came for him, and I felt sure it
must be from Christian.God forgive me, but I kept it back!I thought
there would be no more, but another came; and, as I had kept the
first, I thought I must keep the second, too.it seemed
as if they would burn a hole through the box where I had put them;
and my thoughts were there from as soon as I opened my eyes in the
morning till late at night when I shut them.And then,--did you ever
hear of anything worse!--a third letter came.I held it in my hand a
quarter of an hour; I kept it in my bosom three days, weighing in my
mind whether I should give it to him or put it with the others; but
then I thought perhaps it would lure him away from me, and so I
couldn't help putting it with the others.But now I felt miserable
every day, not only about the letters in the box, but also for fear
another might come.I was afraid of everybody who came to the house;
when we were sitting together inside, I trembled whenever I heard the
door go, for fear it might be somebody with a letter, and then he
might get it.When he was away in the parish, I went about at home
thinking he might perhaps get a letter while there, and then it would
tell him about those that had already come.When I saw him coming
home, I used to look at his face while he was yet a long way off,
and, oh, dear!how happy I felt when he smiled; for then I knew he
had got no letter.He had grown so handsome; like his father, only
fairer, and more gentle-looking.And, then, he had such a voice; when
he sat at the door in the evening-sun, singing towards the mountain
ridge, and listening to the echo, I felt that live without him.If I only saw him, or knew he was somewhere near, and he
seemed pretty happy, and would only give me a word now and then, I
wanted nothing more on earth, and I wouldn't have shed one tear
less."But just when he seemed to be getting on better with people, and
felt happier among them, there came a message from the post-office
that a fourth letter had come; and in it were two hundred dollars!I
thought I should have fell flat down where I stood: what could I do?The letter, I might get rid of, 'twas true; but the money?For two or
three nights I couldn't sleep for it; a little while I left it
up-stairs, then, in the cellar behind a barrel, and once I was so
overdone that I laid it in the window so that he might find it.But
when I heard him coming, I took it back again.At last, however, I
found a way: I gave him the money and told him it had been put out at
interest in my mother's lifetime.He laid it out upon the land, just
as I thought he would; and so it wasn't wasted.But that same
harvest-time, when he was sitting at home one evening, he began
talking about Christian, and wondering why he had so clean forgotten
him."Now again the wound opened, and the money burned me so that I was
obliged to go out of the room.I had sinned, and yet my sin had
answered no end.Since then, I have hardly dared to look into his
eyes, blessed as they are."The mother who has sinned against her own child is the most
miserable of all mothers;... and yet I did it only out of love....
And so, I dare say, I shall be punished accordingly by the loss of
what I love most.For since the middle of the winter, he has again
taken to singing the tune that he used to sing when he was longing to
go away; he has sung it ever since he was a lad, and whenever I hear
it I grow pale.Then I feel I could give up all for him; and only see
this."She took from her bosom a piece of paper, unfolded it and gave
it to the Clergyman."He now and then writes something here; I think
it's some words to that tune.... I brought it with me; for I can't
myself read such small writing... will you look and see if there
isn't something written about his going away...."

There was only one whole verse on the paper.For the second verse,
there were only a few half-finished lines, as if the song was one he
had forgotten, and was now coming into his memory again, line by
line.The first verse ran thus,--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
        Over the mountains high?Now I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine trees grow,
        Waiting and longing to rise
        Nearer the beckoning skies.""Yes, it is about that," replied the Clergyman, putting the paper
down.She sat with folded
hands, looking intently and anxiously into the Clergyman's face,
while tear after tear fell down her cheeks.The Clergyman knew no more what to do in the matter than she did."Well, I think the lad must be left alone in this case," he said."Life can't be made different for his sake; but what he will find in
it must depend upon himself; now, it seems, he wishes to go away in
search of life's good.""But isn't that just what the old crone did?""Yes; she who went away to fetch the sunshine, instead of making
windows in the wall to let it in."The Clergyman was much astonished at Margit's words, and so he had
been before, when she came speak to him on this subject; but,
indeed, she had thought of hardly anything else for eight years."Well, as to the letters, that wasn't quite right.Keeping back what
belonged to your son, can't be justified.But it was still worse to
make a fellow Christian appear in a bad light when he didn't deserve
it; and especially as he was one whom Arne was so fond of, and who
loved him so dearly in return.But we will pray God to forgive you;
we will both pray."Margit still sat with her hands folded, and her head bent down."How I should pray him to forgive me, if I only knew he would stay!"she said: surely, she was confounding our Lord with Arne.The
Clergyman, however, appeared as if he did not notice it."Do you intend to confess it to him directly?"She looked down, and said in a low voice, "I should much like to wait
a little if I dared."The Clergyman turned aside with a smile, and asked, "Don't you
believe your sin becomes greater, the longer you delay confessing
it?"She pulled her handkerchief about with both hands, folded it into a
very small square, and tried to fold it into a still smaller one, but
could not."If I confess about the letters, I'm afraid he'll go away.""Then, you dare not rely upon our Lord?""Oh, yes, I do, indeed," she said hurriedly; and then she added in a
low voice, "but still, if he were to go away from me?""Then, I see you are more afraid of his going away than of continuing
to sin?"Margit had unfolded her handkerchief again; and now she put it to her
eyes, for she began weeping.The Clergyman remained for a while
looking at her silently; then he went on, "Why, then, did you tell me
all this, if it was not to lead to anything?"He waited long, but she
did not answer."Perhaps you thought your sin would become less when
you had confessed it?""Yes, I did," she said, almost in a whisper, while her head bent
still lower upon her breast."Well, well, my good Margit, take
courage; I hope all will yet turn out for the best."she asked, looking up; and a sad smile passed over
her tear-marked face."Yes, I do; I believe God will no longer try you.You will have joy
in your old age, I am sure.""If I might only keep the joy I have!"she said; and the Clergyman
thought she seemed unable to fancy any greater happiness than living
in that constant anxiety."If we had but a little girl, now, who could take hold on him, then
I'm sure he would stay.""You may be sure I've thought of that," she said, shaking her head."Well, there's Eli Boeen; she might be one who would please him.""You may be sure I've thought of that."She rocked the upper part of
her body backwards and forwards."If we could contrive that they might oftener see each other here at
the parsonage?""You may be sure I've thought of that!"She clapped her hands and
looked at the Clergyman with a smile all over her face.He stopped
while he was lighting his pipe."Perhaps this, after all, was what brought you here to-day?"She looked down, put two fingers into the folded handkerchief, and
pulled out one corner of it."Ah, well, God help me, perhaps it was this I wanted."The Clergyman walked up and down, and smiled."Perhaps, too, you came
for the same thing the last time you were here?"She pulled out the corner of the handkerchief still farther, and
hesitated awhile."Well, as you ask me, perhaps I did--yes.""Then, too, it was to carry this point
that you confessed at last the thing you had on your conscience."She spread out the handkerchief to fold it up smoothly again."No;
ah, no; that weighed so heavily upon me, I felt I must tell it to
you, father.""Well, well, my dear Margit, we will talk no more about it."Then, while he was walking up and down, he suddenly added, "Do you
think you would of yourself have come out to me with this wish of
yours?""Well,--I had already come out with so much, that I dare say this,
too, would have come out at last."The Clergyman laughed, but he did not tell her what he thought."Well, we will manage this matter for you,
Margit," he said.She rose to go, for she understood he had now
said all he wished to say."And we will look after them a little.""I don't know how to thank you enough," she said, taking his hand and
courtesying.She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, went towards the door,
courtesied again, and said, "Good bye," while she slowly opened and
shut it.But so lightly as she went towards Kampen that day, she had
not gone for many, many years.When she had come far enough to see
the thick smoke curling up cheerfully from the chimney, she blessed
the house, the whole place, the Clergyman and Arne,--and remembered
they were going to have her favorite dish, smoked ham, for dinner.It was situated in the middle of a
plain, bordered on the one side by a ravine, and on the other, by the
high-road; just beyond the road was a thick wood, with a mountain
ridge rising behind it, while high above all stood blue mountains
crowned with snow.On the other side of the ravine also was a wide
range of mountains, running round the Swart-water on the side where
Boeen was situated: it grew higher as it ran towards Kampen, but then
turned suddenly sidewards, forming the broad valley called the
Lower-tract, which began here, for Kampen was the last place in the
Upper-tract.The front door of the dwelling-house opened towards the road, which
was about two thousand paces off, and a path with leafy birch-trees
on both sides led thither.In front of the house was a little garden,
which Arne managed according to the rules given in his books.The
cattle-houses and barns were nearly all new-built, and stood to the
left hand, forming a square.The house was two stories high, and was
painted red, with white window-frames and doors; the roof was of turf
with many small plants growing upon it, and on the ridge was a
vane-spindle, where turned an iron cock with a high raised tail.Spring had come to the mountain-tracts.It was Sunday morning; the
weather was mild and calm, but the air was somewhat heavy, and the
mist lay low on the forest, though Margit said it would rise later in
the day.Arne had read the sermon, and sung the hymns to his mother,
and he felt better for them himself.Now he stood ready dressed to go
to the parsonage.When he opened the door the fresh smell of the
leaves met him; the garden lay dewy and bright in the morning breeze,
but from the ravine sounded the roaring of the waterfall, now in
lower, then again in louder booms, till all around seemed to tremble.As he went farther from the fall, its booming
became less awful, and soon it lay over the landscape like the deep
tones of an organ.the mother said, opening the
window and looking after him till he disappeared behind the shrubs.The mist had gradually risen, the sun shone bright, the fields and
garden became full of fresh life, and the things Arne had sown and
tended grew and sent up odor and gladness to his mother."Spring is
beautiful to those who have had a long winter," she said, looking
away over the fields, as if in thought.Arne had no positive errand at the parsonage, but he thought he might
go there to ask about the newspapers which he shared with the
Clergyman.Recently he had read the names of several Norwegians who
had been successful in gold digging in America, and among them was
Christian.His relations had long since left the place, but Arne had
lately heard a rumor that they expected him to come home soon.About
this, also, Arne thought he might hear at the parsonage; and if
Christian had already returned, he would go down and see him between
spring and hay-harvest.These thoughts occupied his mind till he came
far enough to see the Swart-water and Boeen on the other side.There,
too, the mist had risen, but it lay lingering on the mountain-sides,
while their peaks rose clear above, and the sunbeams played on the
plain; on the right hand, the shadow of the wood darkened the water,
but before the houses the lake had strewed its white sand on the flat
shore.All at once, Arne fancied himself in the red-painted house
with the white doors and windows, which he had taken as a model for
his own.He did not think of those first gloomy days he had passed
there, but only of that summer they both saw--he and Eli--up beside
her sick-bed.He had not been there since; nor would he have gone for
the whole world.If his thoughts but touched on that time, he turned
crimson; yet he thought of it many times a day; and if anything could
have driven him away from the parish, it was this.He strode onwards, as if to flee from his thoughts; but the farther
he went, the nearer he came to Boeen, and the more he looked at it.The mist had disappeared, the sky shone bright between the frame of
mountains, the birds floated in the sunny air, calling to each other,
and the fields laughed with millions of flowers; here no thundering
waterfall bowed the gladness to submissive awe, but full of life it
gambolled and sang without check or pause.Arne walked till he became glowing hot; then he threw himself down on
the grass beneath the shadow of a hill and looked towards Boeen, but
he soon turned away again to avoid seeing it.Then he heard a song
above him, so wonderfully clear as he had never heard a song before.It came floating over the meadows, mingled with the chattering of the
birds, and he had scarcely recognized the tune ere he recognized the
words also: the tune was the one he loved better than any; the words
were those he had borne in his mind ever since he was a boy, and had
forgotten that same day they were brought forth.He sprang up as if
he would catch them, but then stopped and listened while verse after
verse came streaming down to him:--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
      Over the mountains high?Now, I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine-trees grow,
      Waiting and longing to rise
      Nearer the beckoning skies."Th' eagle is rising afar away,
      Over the mountains high,
    Rowing along in the radiant day
    With mighty strokes to his distant prey,
      Where he will, swooping downwards,
      Where he will, sailing onwards."Apple-tree, longest thou not to go
      Over the mountains high?Gladly thou growest in summer's glow,
    Patiently waitest through winter's snow:
      Though birds on thy branches swing,
      Thou knowest not what they sing."He who has twenty years longed to flee
      Over the mountains high--
    He who beyond them, never will see,
    Smaller, and smaller, each year must be:
      He hears what the birds, say
      While on thy boughs they play."Birds, with your chattering, why did ye come
      Over the mountains high?Beyond, in a sunnier land ye could roam,
    And nearer to heaven could build your home;
      Why have ye come to bring
      Longing, without your wing?"Shall I, then, never, never flee
      Over the mountains high?Rocky walls, will ye always be
    Prisons until ye are tombs for me?--
      Until I lie at your feet
      Wrapped in my winding-sheet?I will away, afar away,
      Over the mountains high!Here, I am sinking lower each day,
    Though my Spirit has chosen the loftiest way;
      Let her in freedom fly;
      Not, beat on the walls and die!"_Once_, I know, I shall journey far
      Over the mountains high.Lord, is thy door already ajar?--
    Dear is the home where thy saved ones are;--
      But bar it awhile from me,
      And help me to long for Thee."Arne stood listening till the sound of the last verse, the last words
died away; then he heard the birds sing and play again, but he dared
not move.Yet he must find out who had been singing, and he lifted
his foot and walked on, so carefully that he did not hear the grass
rustle.A little butterfly settled on a flower at his feet, flew up
and settled a little way before him, flew up and settled again, and
so on all over the hill.But soon he came to a thick bush and
stopped; for a bird flew out of it with a frightened "quitt, quitt!"and rushed away over the sloping hill-side.Then she who was sitting
there looked up; Arne stooped low down, his heart throbbed till he
heard its beats, he held his breath, and was afraid to stir a leaf;
for it was Eli whom he saw.After a long while he ventured to look up again; he wished to draw
nearer, but he thought the bird perhaps had its nest under the bush,
and he was afraid he might tread on it.Then he peeped between the
leaves as they blew aside and closed again.She wore a close-fitting black dress with long white sleeves,
and a straw hat like those worn by boys.In her lap a book was lying
with a heap of wild flowers upon it; her right hand was listlessly
playing with them as if she were in thought, and her left supported
her head.She was looking away towards the place where the bird had
flown, and she seemed as if she had been weeping.Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or dreamed of in all
his life; the sun, too, had spread its gold over her and the place;
and the song still hovered round her, so that Arne thought,
breathed--nay, even his heart beat, in time with it.It seemed so
strange that the song which bore all his longing, _he_ had forgotten,
but _she_ had found.A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times, till at last she
saw it and frightened it away with a flower-stalk, which she put up
as often as it came before her.Then she took up the book and opened
it, but she soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song.He could hear it was "The Tree's early leaf-buds,"
though she often made mistakes, as if she did not quite remember
either the words or the tune.The verse she knew best was the last
one, and so she often repeated it; but she sang it thus:--

   "The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:
    'May I gather thy berries?''Yes; all thou canst see;
        Take them; all are for thee.'Said the Tree--trala--lala, trala, lala--said."Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers around her,
and sang till the tune trembled through the air, and might have been
heard at Boeen.Arne had thought of coming forwards when she began
singing; he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he felt
he _must_ come, but she went away.No!--There she skipped over the hillocks singing; here her hat fell
off, there she took it up again; here she picked a flower, there she
stood deep in the highest grass.It was a long while ere he ventured to peep out
again; at first he only raised his head; he could not see her: he
rose to his knees; still he could not see her: he stood upright; no
she was gone.He thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his mind.Now he would not go to the parsonage.He would not have the
newspapers; would not know anything about Christian.He would not go
home; he would go nowhere; he would do nothing."Oh, God, I am so unhappy!"He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds" till the
mountains resounded.Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and took up the flowers
she had picked, but he flung them away again down the hill on every
side.It was long since he had done so; this struck
him, and made him weep still more.He would go far away, that he
would; no, he would not go away!He thought he was very unhappy; but
when he asked himself why, he could hardly tell.It
was a lovely day; and the Sabbath rest lay over all.The lake was
without a ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling, and though
the little birds continued their twittering, they went towards the
shade of the wood; the dewdrops were gone, and the grass looked
grave; not a breath of wind stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun
was near the meridian.Almost before he knew, he found himself seated
putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;
and while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune
went and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be
sung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:

   "He went in the forest the whole day long,
    The whole day long;
    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,
    A wondrous song."He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,
    A willow spray,
    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,
    The sweet tune lay."It whispered and told him its name at last,
    Its name at last;
    But then, while he listened, away it passed,
    Away it passed."But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,
    Again it stole,
    With touches of love upon his soul,
    Upon his soul."Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,
    And keep it fast;
    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,
    I' the night it passed."'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,
    In the night, I pray;
    For the tune has taken my heart away,
    My heart away.'"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,
    It is thy friend,
    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,
    Thy longing end;

   "'And all the others are nothing to thee,
    Nothing to thee,
    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,
    Never shalt see.'"SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME."Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday
evening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from
church, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock."Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.She hurried
down the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen
playing there with her brother and the Clergyman's son."Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God bless you all."She blushed crimson and wanted to leave
off the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them
to let her go for that evening."I almost think I know you," said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother."Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck
and shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom
fluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed
because she was so out of breath."Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling happy as
she looked at her."P'r'aps you don't know me?"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her
name, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her
before."No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps
you know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother," said Margit, with a
stolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly."I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.""It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in
before I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.""There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli suggested."Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I
suppose?""Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have
plenty of help."Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to
talk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on."Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing
anybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways."Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a
dress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower
hooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little
turned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape
of a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore
the first time Margit danced with him."A pretty stud," she said, looking at it."Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and
Margit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask
also about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen."The farm has improved very much these last few years,
and it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows
now, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a
first-rate way."Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then
asked her age."Have you helped in the house-work?Not much, I dare say--you look so
spruce."Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late."Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when
one gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before
her, why, it doesn't matter so much."Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond
the grounds of the parsonage."It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would
chat a little longer with me."Then Margit began to talk about Arne."I don't know if you know much
of him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear
me, what a deal he has read!"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal."Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but
the way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something
more, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his
mother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to
complain of."Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint."Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be
rewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she
ought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar."I only dropped a little twig I had."I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit
alone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings
blessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad
that day."They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;
but soon Eli stopped."One of my shoe-strings has come down."Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied."He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got cowed while he was
a child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything
by himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli
must see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late
that day."There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.""No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back."Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but there's sure to be
somebody else about;" and Eli had now less objection to it."If only I shall not be too late," she said."Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too
late, I dare say.""Being brought up at the
Clergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?""It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less."No; that, Eli thought she would never have."Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still
folks about here haven't much learning."Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her."No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come
farther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is
Kampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;
but that doesn't matter much, after all."Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood."It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named
Opplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him
that piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be
lonely."Soon they came far enough to see Kampen."Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun
shone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked
down over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house
with its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the
pale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in
stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep
and goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and
the milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of
the waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this
filled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it
whizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that
she unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that
Margit begged her to come on a little faster."I never
heard anything like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened.""You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.""Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said, turning
downwards from the road, into the path."Those trees on each side,
Nils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so
does Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out."exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden
fence."We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now we must go over to
look at the creatures before they're locked in--" But Eli did not
hear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking
at it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a
furtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as
they passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by
one to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would
calve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs
which Arne had got from the South."He aims at all such things," said
Margit, "though one wouldn't think it of him."Then they went into
the barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli
had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found everywhere," Margit
said.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what
kind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind."No less
than three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're
set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,
the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for
there he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it
for manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes
here will find things in good order, I'm sure."Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all
that Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the
garden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,
she begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little
garden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try
it, for she rose directly."Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late," said Margit, as
she stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli
would not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had
been at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they
looked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother
generally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and
pleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock
and a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but
with new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English
fishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and
showed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was
without painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any
in the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the
green mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the
background.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;
for in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne
brought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and
so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name
was painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable
and unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and
now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; "all the best
things were there," the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but
they were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked
towards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household
things not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and
other bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;
so did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of
them twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while
more interested."Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the mother, taking it
from under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it
looked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the
waterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the
spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one
place farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it
just where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into
the depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with
fresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had
grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and
twisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had
not a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled
and bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When
Eli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;
next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green
mountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to
the room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the
Clergyman had more.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his
money.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and
if everything went right they would have some more."But, after all,
money's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better
still," she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to
see, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother
showed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,
were taken out and looked at."I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,
my child," she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had
scarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by
the hand and said in a low voice, "Look at that little red chest;
there's something very choice in that, you may be sure."Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she
thought she would very much like to have."He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest," the mother
whispered; "and he always hides the key."She went to some clothes
that hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the
pocket, and there found the key."Now come and look," she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt
down before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an
odor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen
anything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away."Here, look," she whispered, taking out a fine black
silk neckerchief such as men do not wear."It looks just as if it
was meant for a girl," the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap
and looked at it, but did not say a word."Here's one more," the
mother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother
insisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her
head down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a
neckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They
folded them up again, but slowly."Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands."Everything seems as if it was for a girl."Eli blushed crimson, but
she said nothing."There's some more things yet," said the mother,
taking out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,
her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she
would fain have turned away, but that she could not well do."He has bought something every time he has been to town," continued
the mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from
one thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and
her face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything
like them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they
could be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her
fingers left warm marks on them."I'm hot, I think," she whispered."Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after
another, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?""He has kept them here in this chest--so long."She
laid them all in the chest again, just as they were before."Now
we'll see what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the lid
carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially
beautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,
two gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and
with silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver
of the book she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Boeen."The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,
but saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and
spreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her
hand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without
either of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *

A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the
mother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for
now Arne would soon be at home.Then she came out in the garden to
Eli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw
Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;
but she had been weeping."There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit, caressing her;
"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne," she added, as a black
figure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was
nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not
look at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat
down on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,
and Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the
door and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,
but then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the
wall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines
into the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but
then bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,
but wept still more.She leant
her head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she
did not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save
that of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant
and subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;
Arne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then."Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne," she said,
coming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her
good, she said.*       *       *       *       *

Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and
Arne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of
those light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd
together, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been
accustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and
goes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but
not life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out
between the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to
hear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,
which is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and
thinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they
felt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be
taken from them."I can hardly believe it," Arne said."I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily before her."_Yet it's true_," he said, laying stress on each word; "now I am no
longer going about only thinking; for once I have done something."He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly."No, it
was not I," he said; "it was mother who did it."He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,
"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, "God be thanked
that I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to
see many things which would not have been as they ought...." Then
after a while he added, "But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I
should have gone on alone for ever.""What do you think father will say, dear?"asked Eli, who had been
busy with her own thoughts."I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning," said
Arne;--"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself," he added, determining
he would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things
again; no, never!"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the
nut-wood?""And the tune I had made it for, you got hold
of, too.""I took the one which suited it," she said, looking down.He smiled
joyfully and bent his face down to hers."But the other song you did not know?"she asked looking up....

"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...
yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill."She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed."Then, after all,
you have been served just right," she said."Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well
... another time...."

"Nay; tell it me now."She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, "Surely, you haven't
been up-stairs?"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked
down."Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep
back her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her
still closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his
eyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but
could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned
aside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange
shapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat
with two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was
the nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the
picture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly
rent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the
cliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to
move; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke
and twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and
then from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept
once more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness
lying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words
himself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that
she might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It
was a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in
morning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards
the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while
the women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the
stern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards
Boeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Boeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces
of cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new
clothes, and looking distantly at each other; an old woman sat lonely
and weeping on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.She
wore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the
upper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on
their wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering
refreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in
Eli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who
had come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was
dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar
that Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,
standing at the window where she wrote "Arne."It was open, and he
leant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the
distant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in
the day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,
where he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye
came, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his
fair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a
quiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had
just come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was
tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but
with a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew
to one side.Each had something to say to
the other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more
embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned
towards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, "Perhaps you'll
come too."Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long
while about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking
out from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took
from his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of
wine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though
he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank
some himself, but offered it to her several times while he was
drinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the
cup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, "I'm so
happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long
while since I did so."Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went
on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated
us two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone
farther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken
into our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,
if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so
that we can never more be separated?"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head
down upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no
answer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice
asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"Birgit raised her
head, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face."Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave
her hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but
they clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty
years.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to
the door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard
looked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and
followed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the
rowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said
how strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad."Ah,
whether it wishes to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all
along the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife."Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE

FROM THE BEST POETS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY COVENTRY PATMORE

selected with the matured judgment of a man concentrated on obtaining
insight into the feelings and tastes of childhood, and desirous to
awaken its finest impulses, to cultivate its keenest sensibilities."CINCINNATI GAZETTE."The University Press at Cambridge has turned out many wonderful
specimens of the art, but in exquisite finish it has never equalled
the evidence of its skill which now lies before us.The text,
compared with the average specimens of modern books, shines out with
as bright a contrast as an Elzevir by the side of one of its dingy
and bleared contemporaries.In the quality of its paper, in its
vignettes and head-pieces, the size of its pages, in every feature
that can gratify the eye, indeed, the 'Garland' could hardly bear
improvement.Similar in its general getting up to the much-admired
Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, issued by the same
publishers a few months since, it excels, we think, in the perfection
of various minor details.""It is a beautiful book,--the most beautiful in some respects that
has been published for years; going over a large number of poets and
wide range of themes as none but a poet could have done.A choice
cabinet of precious jewels, or better still, a dainty wreath of
blossoms,--'The Children's Garland.'""It is in all respects a delicious volume, and will be as great a
favorite with the elder as with the younger members of every family

THE CHOICEST ANECDOTES AND SAYINGS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY MARK LEMON

16mo.Here is an interest for a minute or a
dull day.Mark Lemon gives us the result of his recondite searches
and seizures in the regions of infinite jest.Like all good jesters,
he has the quality of sound philosophy in him, and of reason also,
for he discriminates closely, and serves up his wit with a deal of
refinement in it.""So exquisitely is the book printed, that every jest in it shines
like a new gold dollar.It is the apotheosis of jokes.... There is
jollity enough in it to keep the whole American press good humored.""Mark Lemon, who helps to flavor Punch, has gathered this volume of
anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and we have no
fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of some wisdom
and much amusement.By this single 'Lemon' we judge of the rest.""This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth, and as
such, it will be useful in driving dull care away.""It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become all the
better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until now never
had a local habitation and a name.""For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or more likely
to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or study."The Colonel had his own particular chair
in his own particular corner, which was always vacated when he came in
at the door.And then he always had three fingers of the best Bourbon
whiskey, no more and no less, every evening.He never met his bosom friend and pet antagonist at the Planters'
House bar.Judge Whipple, indeed, took his meals upstairs, but he never
descended,--it was generally supposed because of the strong slavery
atmosphere there.However, the Judge went periodically to his friend's
for a quiet Sunday dinner (so called in derision by St.Louisans), on
which occasions Virginia sat at the end of the table and endeavored to
pour water on the flames when they flared up too fiercely.The Sunday following her ride to Bellegarde was the Judge's Sunday,
Certain tastes which she had inherited had hitherto provided her with
pleasurable sensations while these battles were in progress.More than
once had she scored a fair hit on the Judge for her father,--to the
mutual delight of both gentlemen.But to-day she dreaded being present
at the argument.Just why she dreaded it is a matter of feminine
psychology best left to the reader for solution.The argument began, as usual, with the tearing apart limb by limb of the
unfortunate Franklin Pierce, by Judge Whipple."What a miserable exhibition in the eyes of the world," said the
Judge."Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire" (he pronounced this name with
infinite scorn) "managed by Jefferson Davis of Mississippi!""And he was well managed, sir," said the Colonel."What a pliant tool of your Southern slaveholders!I hear that you are
to give him a plantation as a reward.""He deserves it," continued the Judge, with conviction."See the
magnificent forts he permitted Davis to build up in the South, the
arsenals he let him stock.But the
day will, come when they will execrate Pierce before Benedict Arnold,
sir.And look at the infamous Kansas-Nebraska act!That is the greatest
crime, and Douglas and Pierce the greatest criminals, of the century.""Do have some more of that fried chicken, Judge," said Virginia.Whipple helped himself fiercely, and the Colonel smiled."You should be satisfied now," said he."Another Northern man is in the
White House."roared the Judge, with his mouth full.He swallows
the Dred Scott decision, and smirks.What a blot on the history of this
Republic!Whipple, "what are we coming to?A Northern
man, he could gag and bind Kansas and force her into slavery against the
will of her citizens.He packs his Cabinet to support the ruffians
you send over the borders.The very governors he ships out there, his
henchmen, have their stomachs turned.Look at Walker, whom they are
plotting against in Washington.He can't stand the smell of this
Lecompton Constitution Buchanan is trying to jam down their throats.Jefferson Davis would have troops there, to be sure that it goes
through, if he had his way.Can't you see how one sin leads to another,
Carvel?How slavery is rapidly demoralizing a free people?""It is because you won't let it alone where it belongs, sir," retorted
the Colonel.It was seldom that he showed any heat in his replies.He
talked slowly, and he had a way of stretching forth his hand to prevent
the more eager Judge from interrupting him."The welfare of the whole South, as matters now stand, sir, depends upon
slavery.Our plantations could not exist a day without slave labor.If
you abolished that institution, Judge Whipple, you would ruin millions
of your fellow-countrymen,--you would reduce sovereign states to a
situation of disgraceful dependence.And all, sir," now he raised his
voice lest the Judge break in, "all, sir, for the sake of a low breed
that ain't fit for freedom.You and I, who have the Magna Charta and
the Declaration of Independence behind us, who are descended from a
race that has done nothing but rule for ten centuries and more, may well
establish a Republic where the basis of stability is the self-control of
the individual--as long as men such as you and I form its citizens.And the minute you
and I let in <DW65>s, who haven't any more self-control than dogs, on
an equal basis, with as much of a vote as you have,--<DW65>s, sir, that
have lived like wild beasts in the depths of the jungle since the days
of Ham,--what's going to become of our Republic?"But the word was snatched out of his mouth."Education isn't a matter of one generation.No, sir, nor two, nor
three, nor four."Sir," said the Judge, "I can point out <DW64>s of intelligence and
learning.""And I reckon you could teach some monkeys to talk English, and recite
the catechism, and sing emotional hymns, if you brought over a couple of
million from Africa," answered the Colonel, dryly, as he rose to put on
his hat and light a cigar.It was his custom to offer a cigar to the Judge, who invariably refused,
and rubbed his nose with scornful violence.Virginia, on the verge of leaving, stayed on, fascinated by the turn the
argument had taken."Your prejudice is hide-bound, sir," said Mr."No, Whipple," said the Colonel, "when God washed off this wicked
earth, and started new, He saw fit to put the sons of Ham in subjection.They're slaves of each other in Africa, and I reckon they're treated no
better than they are here.Abuses can't be helped in any system, sir,
though we are bettering them.Were the poor in London in the days of the
Edwards as well off as our <DW65>s are to-day?"Because the world
has been a wicked place of oppression since Noah's day, is that any
reason why it should so continue until the day of Judgment?"The Colonel smiled, which was a sign that he was pleased with his
argument."Now, see here, Whipple," said he."If we had any guarantee that you
would let us alone where we are, to manage our slaves and to cultivate
our plantations, there wouldn't be any trouble.But the country keeps
on growing and growing, and you're not content with half.You want
everything,--all the new states must abolish slavery.And after a while
you will overwhelm us, and ruin us, and make us paupers.Do you wonder
that we contend for our rights, tooth and nail?"If it had not been for Virginia and Maryland and the South, this nation
would not be in existence.""First rate, Jinny," he cried."The nation is going to the dogs," he said, mumbling rather to himself
than to the others."We shall never prosper until the curse is shaken
off, or wiped out in blood.Our merchant marine,
of which we were so proud, has been annihilated by these continued
disturbances.But, sir," he cried, hammering his fist upon the table
until the glasses rang, "the party that is to save us was born at
Pittsburgh last year on Washington's birthday.Carvel, with amusement, "The Black Republican
Party, made up of old fools and young Anarchists, of Dutchmen and
<DW65>-worshippers.Why, Whipple, that party's a joke."Abraham Lincoln, sir," thundered Mr."And to my way of
thinking he has uttered a more significant phrase on the situation than
any of your Washington statesmen.'This government,' said he to a friend
of mine, 'cannot exist half slave and half free.'"Carvel
stirred uneasily, and in spite of himself, as though he were listening
to an oracle."He's a demagogue, seeking for striking phrases, sir.You're too
intelligent a man to be taken in by such as he.""I tell you he is not, sir.""I know him, sir," cried the Colonel, taking down his feet.Richardson of Springfield tells me he is low down.He was born in a log
cabin, and spends most of his time in a drug-store telling stories that
you would not listen to, Judge Whipple.""I would listen to anything he said," replied the Judge.But
mark my words, the day will come when it will.He was ballotted for
Vice-President in the Philadelphia convention last year.If the convention had heard him speak at Bloomington,
he would have been nominated instead of Fremont.If the nation could
have heard him, he would be President to-day instead of that miserable
Buchanan.And while the idiots on the
platform were drivelling, the people kept calling for Lincoln.He came ambling
out of the back of the hall, a lanky, gawky looking man, ridiculously
ugly, sir.But the moment he opened his mouth he had us spellbound.The
language which your low-down lawyer used was that of a God-sent prophet,
sir.He had those Illinois bumpkins all worked up,--the women crying,
and some of the men, too.Good Lord, they were mad--'We will
say to the Southern disunionists,' he cried,--'we will say to the
Southern disunionists, we won't go out of the Union, and you shan't.'"And he stood over the Judge in his favorite
attitude,--with his feet apart,--as he lighted another cigar."I reckon we're going to have war, Silas," said he, slowly; "but don't
you think that your Mr.I don't
count his bluster worth a cent.It's this youngster who comes
out here from Boston and buys a <DW65> with all the money he's got in
the world.And if he's an impetuous young fool; I'm no judge of men.""Appleton Brice wasn't precisely impetuous," remarked Mr.And
he smiled a little bitterly, as though the word had stirred a memory."It seems to be a kind
of fatality with me to get along with Yankees.I reckon there's a screw
loose somewhere, but Brice acted the man all the way through.He goa
a fall out of you, Silas, in your room, after the show.Virginia had risen, and she was standing very erects with a flush on her
face, waiting for her father to finish."To see Anne Brinsmade," she said.Hers was the one voice that seemed
to soften him--it never failed.He turned to her now with a movement
that was almost gentle."Virginia, I should like you to know my young
Yankee," said he."Thank you, Uncle Silas," said the girl, with dignity, "but I scarcely
think that he would care to know me."He feels no stronger than I do," replied the Judge."You have gotten used to me in eighteen years, and besides," she
flashed, "you never spent all the money you had in the world for a
principle."Whipple smiled as she went out of the door."I have spent pretty near all," he said.But more to himself than to the
Colonel.That evening, some young people came in to tea, two of the four big
Catherwood boys, Anne Brinsmade and her brother Jack, Puss Russell and
Bert, and Eugenie Renault.In an evil
moment Puss Russell started the subject of the young Yankee who had
deprived her of Hester.Puss was ably seconded by Jack Brinsmade, whose
reputation as a tormentor extended far back into his boyhood.In vain;
did Anne, the peacemaker, try to quench him, while the big Catherwoods
and Bert Russell laughed incessantly.She would not speak to Puss as that young lady bade her good night.And
the Colonel, coming home from an evening with Mr.Brinsmade, found his
daughter in an armchair, staring into the sitting-room fire.There was
no other light in the room Her chin was in her hand, and her lips were
pursed.said the Colonel, "what's the trouble now?""Come," he insisted, "what have they been doing to my girl?""I don't want to go to balls all my life.I want to go to
boarding-school, and learn something.Emily is going to Monticello after
Christmas.He, thought of his lonely
widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken."It will only be for a little while.And Monticello isn't very far, Pa.""Well, well, there is plenty of time to think it over between now and
January," he said."And now I have a little favor to ask of you, honey."The Colonel took the other armchair, stretched his feet toward the
blaze, and stroked his goatee.He glanced covertly at his daughter's
profile."Yes, Pa" (without turning her head)."Jinny, I was going to speak of this young.He's a stranger here,
and he comes of a good family, and--and I like him.""And you wish me to invite him to my party," finished Virginia."I reckon you guessed it," he said.Then she said:

"Do you think, in bidding against me, that he behaved, like a
gentleman?""Lord, Virginia," he said, "I thought you told the judge this afternoon
teat it was done out of principle."But she bit her lip

"He is like all Yankees, without one bit of consideration for a woman."What makes you imagine that he thought of you at all, my dear?"asked
her father, mildly, "He does not know you.""I reckon that he wasn't worrying much about us.And besides, he was
trying to save Hester from Jennings.""I thought that you said that it was to be my party, Pa," said Virginia,
irrelevantly.The Colonel looked thoughtful, then he began to laugh."Haven't we enough Black Republican friends?""I didn't say that I wouldn't have him," she answered.The Colonel rose, and brushed the ashes from his goat.CHAPTER X. THE LITTLE HOUSE

When Stephen attempted to thank Judge Whipple for going on Hester's
bond, he merely said, "Tut, tut."The Judge rose at six, so his man Shadrach told Stephen.He had his
breakfast at the Planters' House at seven, read the Missouri Democrat,
and returned by eight.Sometimes he would say good morning to Stephen
and Richter, and sometimes he would not.Whipple was out a great
part of the day, and he had many visitors.Like
a great specialist (which he was), he would see only one person at a
time.And Stephen soon discovered that his employer did not discriminate
between age or sex, or importance, or condition of servitude.In short,
Stephen's opinion of Judge Whipple altered very materially before the
end of that first week.He saw poor women and disconsolate men go into
the private room ahead of rich citizens, who seemed content to wait
their turn on the hard wooden chairs against the wall of the main
office.There was one incident in particular, when a well-dressed
gentleman of middle age paced impatiently for two mortal hours after
Shadrach had taken his card into the sanctum.When at last he had been
admitted, Mr.It was that of a
big railroad man from the East.The transom let out the true state of
affairs."See here, Callender," the Judge was heard to say, "you fellows don't
like me, and you wouldn't come here unless you had to.But when your
road gets in a tight place, you turn up and expect to walk in ahead of
my friends.No, sir, if you want to see me, you've got to wait."Callender made some inaudible reply, "Money!"roared the Judge,
"take your money to Stetson, and see if you win your case."Richter smiled at Stephen, as if in sheer happiness at this
vindication of an employer who had never seemed to him to need a
defence.Stephen was greatly drawn toward this young German with the great scar
on his pleasant face.And he was itching to know about that scar.Every day, after coming in from dinner, Richter lighted a great brown
meerschaum, and read the St.Louis 'Anzeiger' and the 'Westliche Post'.Often he sang quietly to himself:

          "Deutschlands Sohne
          Laut ertone
          Euer Vaterlandgesang.Du Land des Ruhmes,
          Weih' zu deines Heiligthumes
          Hutern, uns and unser Schwert."And some wonderful quality in the German's
voice gave you a thrill when you heard them, albeit you could not
understand the words.Richter never guessed how Stephen, with his eyes
on his book, used to drink in those airs.And presently he found out
that they were inspired.The day that the railroad man called, and after he and the Judge had
gone out together, the ice was broken."You Americans from the North are a queer people, Mr.Richter, as he put on his coat.The Judge, at first I could not comprehend him--he would
scold and scold.But one day I see that his heart is warm, and since
then I love him.Have you ever eaten a German dinner, Mr.It was raining, the streets ankle-deep in mud, and the beer-garden by
the side of the restaurant to which they went was dreary and bedraggled.Inside, to all intents and
purposes, it was Germany.A most genial host crossed the room to give
Mr.Richter a welcome that any man might have envied."We were all 'Streber' together, in Germany," said Richter."Strivers, you might call it in English.In the Vaterland those who
seek for higher and better things--for liberty, and to be rid of
oppression--are so called.That is why we fought in '48 and lost.And
that is why we came here, to the Republic.I fear I will never be
the great lawyer--but the striver, yes, always.We must fight once more
to be rid of the black monster that sucks the blood of freedom--vampire."I fear,--yes, I fear," said the German, shaking his head.cried Richter, with a flash of anger in his blue eyes
that died as suddenly as it came,--died into reproach."Call me not a
foreigner--we Germans will show whether or not we are foreigners when
the time is ripe.Your
ancestors founded it, and fought for it, that the descendants of mine
might find a haven from tyranny.My friend, one-half of this city is
German, and it is they who will save it if danger arises.You must come
with me one night to South St.You will not think of us as foreign
swill, but as patriots who love our new Vaterland even as you love it.You must come to our Turner Halls, where we are drilling against the
time when the Union shall have need of us."exclaimed Stephen, in still greater
astonishment.The German's eloquence had made him tingle, even as had
the songs.answered Richter, smiling and holding up his glass
of beer."You will come to a 'commerce', and see."This is not our blessed Lichtenhainer, that we drink at Jena.One may
have a pint of Lichtenhainer for less than a groschen at Jena.Aber,"
he added as he rose, with a laugh that showed his strong teeth, "we
Americans are rich."As Stephen's admiration for his employer grew, his fear of him waxed
greater likewise.The Judge's methods of teaching law were certainly not
Harvard's methods.For a fortnight he paid as little attention to the
young man as he did to the messengers who came with notes and cooled
their heels in the outer office until it became the Judge's pleasure to
answer them.But he stuck to
his Chitty and his Greenleaf and his Kent.It was Richter who advised
him to buy Whittlesey's "Missouri Form Book," and warned him of Mr.There came a
fearful hour of judgment.Whipple
descended out of a clear sky, and instantly the law terms began to
rattle in Stephen's head like dried peas in a can.It was the Old Style
of Pleading this time, without a knowledge of which the Judge declared
with vehemence that a lawyer was not fit to put pen to legal cap."First," said Stephen, "was the Declaration.The answer to that was the
Plea.Then came the Rejoinder,
then the Surrejoinder, then the Rebutter, then the Surrebutter.But they
rarely got that far," he added unwisely."A good principle in Law, sir," said the Judge, "is not to volunteer
information."Stephen was somewhat cast down when he reached home that Saturday
evening.He had come out of his examination with feathers drooping.He
had been given no more briefs to copy, nor had Mr.Whipple vouchsafed
even to send him on an errand.He had not learned how common a thing
it is with young lawyers to feel that they are of no use in the world.His mother, knitting before the fire in her own room, greeted him
with her usual quiet smile of welcome.He tried to give her a humorous
account of his catechism of the morning, but failed."I am quite sure that he doesn't like me," said Stephen."If he did, he would not show it," she answered."I can feel it," said Stephen, dejectedly."The Judge was here this afternoon," said his mother.They say that he never calls in
the daytime, and rarely in the evening."He said that some of this Boston nonsense must be gotten out of you,"
answered Mrs.That
you needed to rub against the plain men who were building up the West.Who were making a vast world-power of the original little confederation
of thirteen states.And Stephen," she added more earnestly, "I am not
sure but what he is right."And for a long time he sat staring into the fire."He told me about a little house which we might rent very cheaply.The house is on this street, next door to Mr.Whipple brought the key, that we
might inspect it to-morrow.""But a servant," objected Stephen, "I suppose that we must have a
servant.""That poor girl whom you freed is here to see me every day.But Hester has no work and she is a burden to Judge
Whipple.Oh, no," she continued, in response to Stephen's glance, "the
Judge did not mention that, but I think he had it in mind that Nester
might come.Brice and Stephen walked down
Olive Street, and stood looking at a tiny house wedged in between, two
large ones with scrolled fronts.Sad memories of Beacon Street filled
them both as they gazed, but they said nothing of this to each other.As
Stephen put his hand on the latch of the little iron gate, a gentleman
came out of the larger house next door.He was past the middle age,
somewhat scrupulously dressed in the old fashion, in swallowtail coat
and black stock.Benevolence was in the generous mouth, in the large
nose that looked like Washington's, and benevolence fairly sparkled in
the blue eyes.He smiled at them as though he had known them always,
and the world seemed brighter that very instant.They smiled in return,
whereupon the gentleman lifted his hat.And the kindliness and the
courtliness of that bow made them very happy."Did you wish to look at
the house, madam?"he asked "Yes, sir," said Mrs."Allow me to open it for you," he said, graciously taking the key from
her."I fear that you will find it inconvenient and incommodious, ma'am.I should be fortunate, indeed, to get a good tenant."He fitted the key in the door, while Stephen and his mother smiled at
each other at the thought of the rent.The gentleman opened the door,
and stood aside to let them enter, very much as if he were showing them
a palace for which he was the humble agent.They went into the little parlor, which was nicely furnished in mahogany
and horsehair.And it had back of it a bit of a dining room, with a
little porch overlooking the back yard.Brice thought of the dark
and stately high-ceiled dining-room she had known throughout her married
days: of the board from which a royal governor of Massachusetts Colony
had eaten, and some governors of the Commonwealth since.Thank God, she
had not to sell that, nor the Brice silver which had stood on the high
sideboard with the wolves and the shield upon it.She had not hoped again to have a home for these
things, nor the father's armchair, nor the few family treasures that
were to come over the mountains.The gentleman, with infinite tact, said little, but led the way through
the rooms.At the door of the kitchen he
stopped, and laid his hand kindly on Stephen's shoulder:-- "Here we may
not enter.This is your department, ma'am," said he.Finally, as they stood without waiting for the gentleman, who insisted
upon locking the door, they observed a girl in a ragged shawl hurrying
up the street.As she approached them, her eyes were fixed upon the
large house next door.But suddenly, as the gentleman turned, she caught
sight of him, and from her lips escaped a cry of relief.She flung open
the gate, and stood before him.Brinsmade," she cried, "mother is dying.You have done so much
for us, sir,--couldn't you come to her for a little while?She thought
if she might see you once more, she would die happy."The voice was
choked by a sob.Brinsmade took the girl's hand in his own, and turned to the lady
with as little haste, with as much politeness, as he had shown before."You will excuse me, ma'am," he said, with his hat in his hand.But she and her son watched him
as he walked rapidly down the street, his arm in the girl's, until they
were out of sight.Might not the price of this little house be likewise a piece of the
Brinsmade charity?Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday-best broadcloth was a marvel of
propriety.It seemed to Stephen that his face wore a graver expression
on Sunday when he met him standing on Miss Crane's doorstep, picking
the lint from his coat.But he
remembered what the Judge had said to his mother, and nodded.Why,
indeed, should he put on airs with this man who had come to St.Louis
unknown and unrecommended and poor, who by sheer industry had made
himself of importance in the large business of Carvel &, Company?As
for Stephen Brice, he was not yet earning his salt, but existing by the
charity of Judge Silas Whipple.Hopper, his glance caught by the
indefinable in Stephen's costume."Be you asked to Virginia Carvel's party?""I do not know Miss Carvel," said Stephen, wondering how well the other
did.And if the truth be told, he was a little annoyed at Mr.Hopper's
free use of her name."That shouldn't make no difference," said Eliphalet with just a shade
of bitterness in his tone."They keep open house, like all Southerners,"
Mr.Hopper hesitated,--"for such as come well recommended.I'most
forgot," said he."I callate you're not any too well recommended.I
'most forgot that little transaction down to the Court House.They do
say that she wanted that gal almighty bad,--she was most awful cut up
not to get her.Show her she
can't have everything her own way.And say," he added, with laughter,
"how you did fix that there stuckup Colfax boy!He'll never forgive
you no more than she.Hopper, meditatively, "it was a
durned-fool trick."I think Stephen's critics will admit that he had a good right to be
angry, and that they will admire him just a little bit because he kept
his temper.Hopper evidently thought he had gone too far."She ain't got no use for me, neither," he said."She's not long sighted, that's sure," replied Eliphalet, with emphasis.And it was then he made the
determination to write for the newspapers in order to pay the rent on
Mr.Miss Carvel's coming-out party was the chief
topic."They do say the Colonel is to spend a sight of money on that ball,"
said Mrs."I callate he ain't pushed for money," that gentleman vouchsafed."He's a good man, and done well by you, Mr."So--so," answered Eliphalet."But I will say that I done something for
the Colonel.I've saved him a hundred times my pay since I showed old
Hood the leaks.And I got a thousand dollar order from Wright & Company
this week for him.""I dare say you'd keep a tight hand enough on expenses," said Miss
Crane, half in sarcasm, half in approval."If Colonel Carvel was doin' business in New England," said Eliphalet,
"he'd been bankrupt long ago."Abner Reed broke in, "he'll get a
right smart mint o' money when he marries Virginia.They do say her
mother left her independent."And young Colfax ain't precisely a pauper," said Miss Crane."I'll risk a good deal that she don't marry Colfax," said Mr."No," he answered, "it ain't broke off.But I callate she won't have him
when the time comes.Heavy at heart, Stephen climbed the stairs, thanking heaven that he
had not been drawn into the controversy.He suspected that gentleman of an
aggressive determination to achieve wealth, and the power which comes
with it, for the purpose of using that power upon those beneath
him.Nay, when he thought over his conversation, he suspected him of
more,--of the intention to marry Virginia Carvel.It will be seen whether Stephen was right or wrong.He took a walk that afternoon, as far out as a place called Lindell's
Grove, which afterward became historic.And when he returned to the
house, his mother handed him a little white envelope."It came while you were out," she said.He turned it over, and stared at his name written across the front in a
feminine hand In those days young ladies did not write in the bold and
masculine manner now deemed proper.Stephen stared at the note, manlike,
and pondered."Why don't you open it, and see?"What a funny formal little note we should think
it now!He read it, and he read it
again, and finally he walked over to the window, still holding it in his
hand.Brice did not,
wherein she proved herself their superiors in the knowledge of mankind.Stephen stood for a long while looking out into the gathering dusk.Then
he went over to the fireplace and began tearing the note into little
bits.Only once did he pause, to look again at his name on the envelope."It is an invitation to Miss Carvel's party," he said.By Thursday of that week the Brices, with thanksgiving in their hearts,
had taken possession of Mr."MISS JINNY"

The years have sped indeed since that gray December when Miss Virginia
Carvel became eighteen.Louis has changed from a pleasant
Southern town to a bustling city, and a high building stands on the site
of that wide and hospitable home of Colonel Carvel.And the Colonel's
thoughts that morning, as Ned shaved him, flew back through the years to
a gently rolling Kentucky countryside, and a pillared white house among
the oaks.He was riding again with Beatrice Colfax in the springtime.Again he stretched out his arm as if to seize her bridle-hand, and he
felt the thoroughbred rear.Then the vision faded, and the memory of his
dead wife became an angel's face, far--so far away.Louis, and with his inheritance had founded
his business, and built the great double house on the corner.The child
came, and was named after the noble state which had given so many of her
sons to the service of the Republic.A black war of conquest which,
like many such, was to add to the nation's fame and greatness: Glory
beckoned, honor called--or Comyn Carvel felt them.With nothing of the
profession of arms save that born in the Carvels, he kissed Beatrice
farewell and steamed down the Mississippi, a captain in Missouri
regiment.Ned, as he shaved his master's face, read his thoughts by the strange
sympathy of love.He had heard the last pitiful words of his mistress.Posthlewaite as he read the sublime
service of the burial of the dead.It was Ned who had met his master,
the Colonel, at the levee, and had fallen sobbing at his feet.Long after he was shaved that morning, the Colonel sat rapt in his
chair, while the faithful servant busied himself about the room, one eye
on his master the while.Carvel's revery is broken by
the swift rustle of a dress, and a girlish figure flutters in and plants
itself on the wide arm of his mahogany barber chair, Mammy Easter in the
door behind her.And the Colonel, stretching forth his hands, strains
her to him, and then holds her away that he may look and look again into
her face."Honey," he said, "I was thinking of your mother."Virginia raised her eyes to the painting on the wall over the marble
mantel.The face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and
gentle, delicately feminine.It had an expression of sorrow that seemed
a prophecy.The Colonel's hand strayed upward to Virginia's head."You are not like her, honey," he said: "You may see for yourself.You
are more like your Aunt Bess, who lived in Baltimore, and she--"

"I know," said Virginia, "she was the image of the beauty, Dorothy
Manners, who married my great-grandfather.""Yes, Jinny," replied the Colonel, smiling.You are
somewhat like your great-grandmother."cried Virginia, putting her hand over his mouth, "I like
that.You and Captain Lige are always afraid of turning my head.I need
not be a beauty to resemble her.When you
took me on to Calvert House to see Uncle Daniel that time, I remember
the picture by, by--"

"Sir Joshua Reynolds.""You were only eleven," says the Colonel."She is not a difficult person to remember."Carvel, laughing, "especially if you have lived with
her.""Not that I wish to be that kind," said Virginia, meditatively,--"to
take London by storm, and keep a man dangling for years.""But he got her in the end," said the Colonel."And a very honorable record it is," exclaimed the Colonel."Jinny,
we shall read it together when we go a-visiting to Culvert House.I
remember the old gentleman as well as if I had seen him yesterday.""Pa," she began, "Pa, did you ever see the pearls Dorothy Carvel wore on
her wedding day?"Well, I reckon I did," replied the Colonel, gazing at her steadfastly."Pa, Uncle Daniel told me that I was to have that necklace when I was
old enough."said the Colonel, fidgeting, "your Uncle Daniel was just fooling
you.""He's a bachelor," said Virginia; "what use has he got for it?""Why," says the Colonel, "he's a young man yet, your uncle, only
fifty-three.I've known older fools than he to go and do it.I've seed 'em at seventy, an' shufflin' about
peart as Marse Clarence's gamecocks.Why, dar was old Marse Ludlow--"

"Now, Mister Johnson," Virginia put in severely, "no more about old
Ludlow."Ned grinned from ear to ear, and in the ecstasy of his delight dropped
the Colonel's clothes-brush.he cried, "ef she ain't
recommembered."Recovering his gravity and the brush simultaneously, he
made Virginia a low bow.I sholy is gwinter s'lute
you dis day.May de good Lawd make you happy, Miss Jinny, an' give you a
good husban'--"

"Thank you, Mister Johnson, thank you," said Virginia, blushing."How come she recommembered, Marse Comyn?Doan't you talk to Ned 'bout de quality, Marsa.""And when did I ever talk to you about the quality, you scalawag?""Th' ain't none 'cept de bes' quality keep they word dat-a-way," said
Ned, as he went off to tell Uncle Ben in the kitchen.Was there ever, in all this wide country, a good cook who was not a
tyrant?Uncle Ben Carvel was a veritable emperor in his own domain; and
the Colonel himself, had he desired to enter the kitchen, would have
been obliged to come with humble and submissive spirit.As for Virginia,
she had had since childhood more than one passage at arms with Uncle
Ben.And the question of who had come off victorious had been the
subject of many a debate below stairs.There were a few days in the year, however, when Uncle Ben permitted
the sanctity of his territory to be violated.On such a day it was his habit to retire to the broken chair
beside the sink (the chair to which he had clung for five-and-twenty
years).There he would sit, blinking, and carrying on the while an
undercurrent of protests and rumblings, while Miss Virginia and other
young ladies mixed and chopped and boiled and baked and gossiped.But
woe to the unfortunate Rosetta if she overstepped the bounds of respect!Woe to Ned or Jackson or Tato, if they came an inch over the threshold
from the hall beyond!Even Aunt Easter stepped gingerly, though she was
wont to affirm, when assisting Miss Jinny in her toilet, an absolute
contempt for Ben's commands."So Ben ordered you out, Mammy?"think I'se skeered o' him, honey?Reckon I'd frail
'em good ef he cotched hole of me with his black hands.Jes' let him try
to come upstairs once, honey, an' see what I say to'm."Nevertheless Ben had, on one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, ordered
Mammy Easter out, and she had gone.And now, as she was working the beat
biscuits to be baked that evening, Uncle Ben's eye rested on her with
suspicion.What mere man may write with any confidence of the delicacies which
were prepared in Uncle's kitchen that morning?No need in those days of
cooking schools.What Southern lady, to the manner born, is not a cook
from the cradle?Even Ben noted with approval Miss Virginia's scorn for
pecks and pints, and grunted with satisfaction over the accurate pinches
of spices and flavors which she used.And he did Miss Eugenie the honor
to eat one of her praleens.That night came Captain Lige Brent, the figure of an eager and
determined man swinging up the street, and pulling out his watch under
every lamp-post.And in his haste, in the darkness of a midblock, he
ran into another solid body clad in high boots and an old army overcoat,
beside a wood wagon."Howdy, Captain," said he of the high boots."Well, I just thought as much," was the energetic reply; "minute I seen
the rig I knew Captain Grant was behind it."He held out a big hand, which Captain Grant clasped, just looking at
his own with a smile.The stranger was Captain Elijah Brent of the
'Louisiana'."Now," said Brent, "I'll just bet a full cargo that you're off to the
Planters' House, and smoke an El Sol with the boys.""You're keen, Captain," said he."I've got something here that'll outlast an El Sol a whole day,"
continued Captain Breast, tugging at his pocket and pulling out a
six-inch cigar as black as the night.The Captain instantly struck a match on his boot and was puffing in a
silent enjoyment which delighted his friend."Reckon he don't bring out cigars when you make him a call," said the
steamboat captain, jerking his thumb up at the house.Captain Grant did not reply to that, nor did Captain Lige expect him to,
as it was the custom of this strange and silent man to speak ill of no
one.He turned rather to put the stakes back into his wagon."Where are you off to, Lige?""Lord bless my soul," said Captain Lige, "to think that I could forget!""Grant, did you ever see my
little sweetheart, Jinny Carvel?""She ain't little
any more, and she eighteen to-day."Captain Grant clapped his hand to his forehead."Say, Lige," said he, "that reminds me.A month or so ago I pulled a
fellow out of Renault's area across from there.After he got away I saw the Colonel and his daughter in the
window."Instantly Captain Lige became excited, and seized Captain Grant by the
cape of his overcoat."Say, Grant, what kind of appearing fellow was he?""Short, thick-set, blocky face.""I reckon I know," said Breast, bringing down his fist on the wagon
board; "I've had my eye on him for some little time."He walked around the block twice after Captain Grant had driven down the
muddy street, before he composed himself to enter the Carvel mansion.He
paid no attention to the salutations of Jackson, the butler, who saw him
coming and opened the door, but climbed the stairs to the sitting-room."Why, Captain Lige, you must have put wings on the Louisiana," said
Virginia, rising joyfully from the arm of her father's chair to meet
him.What, give me up when I never missed a birthday,--and this the best of
all of 'em."If your pa had got sight of me shovin' in wood and cussin' the pilot
for slowin' at the crossin's, he'd never let you ride in my boat again.Bill Jenks said: 'Are you plum crazy, Brent?'Five dollars'' says I; 'wouldn't go in for five hundred.To-morrow's
Jinny Carvel's birthday, and I've just got to be there.'I reckon the
time's come when I've got to say Miss Jinny," he added ruefully.The Colonel rose, laughing, and hit the Captain on the back."Drat you, Lige, why don't you kiss the girl?Can't you see she's
waiting?"The honest Captain stole one glance at Virginia, and turned red copper
color."Shucks, Colonel, I can't be kissing her always."We'll not talk of husbands yet awhile, Lige."Virginia went up to Captain Lige, deftly twisted into shape his black
tie, and kissed him on the check.How his face burned when she touched
him.said she, "and don't you ever dare to treat me as a young lady.Why, Pa, he's blushing like a girl.He's going to be married at last to that Creole girl in New Orleans."The Colonel slapped his knee, winked slyly at Lige, while Virginia began
to sing:

       "I built me a house on the mountain so high,
        To gaze at my true love as she do go by.""There's only one I'd ever marry, Jinny," protested the Captain,
soberly, "and I'm a heap too old for her.But I've seen a youngster
that might mate with her, Colonel," he added mischievously."If he just
wasn't a Yankee.Jinny, what's the story I hear about Judge Whipple's
young man buying Hester?"It was Virginia's turn to blush, and she grew
red as a peony."He's a tall, hateful, Black Republican Yankee!""There you do him wrong, honey," the Colonel put in."I hear he took Hester to Miss Crane's," the Captain continued, filling
the room with his hearty laughter."That boy has sand enough, Jinny; I'd
like to know him.""You'll have that priceless opportunity to-night," retorted Miss
Virginia, as she flung herself out of the room."Pa has made me invite
him to my party."Whereupon the Captain hastily
ripped open the bundle under his arm and produced a very handsome India
shawl.With a cry of delight Virginia threw it over her shoulders and
ran to the long glass between the high windows."Her father, I reckon," was the prompt reply."Captain Lige," said she, turning to him."If you had only kept the
presents you have brought me from New Orleans, you might sell out your
steamboat and be a rich man.""He is a rich man," said the Colonel, promptly."Did you ever miss
bringing her a present, Lige?""When the Cora Anderson burnt," answered the Captain."Why," cried Virginia, "you brought me a piece of her wheel, with the
char on it.It was when the
French dress, with the furbelows, which Madame Pitou had gotten me from
Paris for you, was lost.""And I think I liked the piece of wheel better," says Virginia."It was
brought me by a brave man, the last to leave his boat.""And who should be the last to leave, but the captain?I saw the thing
in the water; and I just thought we ought to have a relic.""Lige," said the Colonel, putting up his feet, "do you remember the
French toys you used to bring up here from New Orleans?""Colonel," replied Brent, "do you recall the rough and uncouth young
citizen who came over here from Cincinnati, as clerk on the Vicksburg?""I remember, sir, that he was so promising that they made him
provisional captain the next trip, and he was not yet twenty-four years
of age.""And do you remember buying the Vicksburg at the sheriff's sale for
twenty thousand dollars, and handing her over to young Brent, and
saying, 'There, my son, she's your boat, and you can pay for her when
you like'?"Carvel, sternly, "your memory's too good.But
I proved myself a good business man, Jinny; he paid for her in a year.""You don't mean that you made him pay you for the boat?""Why, Pa, I didn't think you were that mean!""I was a heap meaner," said her father.Virginia drew in her breath, and looked at the Colonel in amazement."He's the meanest man I know," said Captain Lige."He made me pay
interest, and a mint julep.""Upon my word, Pa," said Miss Virginia, soberly, "I shouldn't have
believed it of you."Just then Jackson, in his white jacket; came to announce that supper was
ready, and they met Ned at the dining-room door, fairly staggering under
a load of roses."Marse Clarence done send 'em in, des picked out'n de hothouse dis
afternoon, Miss Jinny.She took the flowers from Ned, one by one, and to
the wonderment of Captain Lige and her--father strewed them hither and
thither upon the table until the white cloth was hid by the red flowers.The Colonel stroked his goatee and nudged Captain Lige."Look-a-there, now," said he."Any other woman would have spent two
mortal hours stickin' 'em in china."Virginia, having critically surveyed her work, amid exclamations from
Ned and Jackson, had gone around to her place.And there upon her plate
lay a pearl necklace.For an instant she clapped her palms together,
staring at it in bewilderment.And once more the little childish cry of
delight, long sweet to the Colonel's ears, escaped her."Pa," she said, "is it--?"And there she stopped, for fear that it might
not be."Your Uncle Daniel sent it, as he
promised.And when you go upstairs, if Easter has done as I told her,
you will see a primrose dress with blue coin-flowers on your bed.Daniel
thought you might like that, too, for a keepsake.Dorothy Manners wore
it in London, when she was a girl."And so Virginia ran and threw her arms about her father's neck, and
kissed him again and again.And lest the Captain feel badly, she laid
his India shawl beside her; and the necklace upon it.What a joyful supper they had,--just the three of them!And as the fresh
roses filled the room with fragrance, Virginia filled it with youth and
spirits, and Mr.Carvel and the Captain with honest, manly merriment.And Jackson plied Captain Brent (who was a prime favorite in that house)
with broiled chicken and hot beat biscuits and with waffles, until at
length he lay back in his chair and heaved a sigh of content, lighting a
cigar.And then Virginia, with a little curtsey to both of them, ran off
to dress for the party."Well," said Captain Brent, "I reckon there'll be gay goings-on here
to-night.I wouldn't miss the sight of 'em, Colonel, for all the cargoes
on the Mississippi."No, thank you, Lige," Mr."Do you remember, one
morning some five years ago, when I took in at the store a Yankee named
Hopper?Captain Brent jumped, and the ashes of his cigar fell on his coat.He
had forgotten his conversation with Captain Grant."I reckon I do," he said dryly.For a moment he was on the point of telling the affair.He could not be sure of Eliphalet from Grant's description.So
he decided to await a better time.Captain Brent was one to make sure of
his channel before going ahead."Well," continued the Colonel, "I have been rather pushed the last week,
and Hopper managed things for this dance.He got the music, and saw the
confectioner.But he made such a close bargain with both of 'em that
they came around to me afterward," he added, laughing."Lige," replied the Colonel, "you never do get over a prejudice.Yes,
he's coming, just to oversee things.He seems to have mighty little
pleasure, and he's got the best business head I ever did see.Carvel, meditatively, as he put on his hat, "a Yankee, when he
will work, works like all possessed.Hood don't like him any more than
you do, but he allows Hopper is a natural-born business man.Last month
Samuels got tight, and Wright & Company were going to place the largest
order in years.I I'm
too old to solicit business, Hood,' said I.'Then there's only one man
to send,' says he, 'young Hopper.He'll get the order, or I'll give up
this place I've had for twenty years.'Hopper 'callated' to get it, and
another small one pitched in.And you'd die laughing, Lige, to hear how
he did it.""Some slickness, I'll gamble," grunted Captain Lige."Well, I reckon 'twas slick," said the Colonel, thoughtfully."You know
old man Wright hates a solicitor like poison.And
maybe you've noticed signs stuck up all over his store, 'No Solicitors
nor Travelling Men Allowed Here'.""But Hopper--Hopper walks in, sir, bold as you please, right past the
signs till he comes to the old man's cage.Wright,'
says he to the clerk.shouts old Wright,
flying 'round in his chair, 'what the devil does this mean?'And you dare to come in
here?bellowed the
old man; 'I reckon you're a damned Yankee.I reckon I'll upset your
"callations" for once.And if I catch you in here again, I'll wring your
neck like a roostah's."Wright himself,--afterward," replied Mr.The old man lives at the Planters' House, you know.Hopper do but go 'round there that very night and give a <DW65> two bits
to put him at the old man's table.When Wright comes and sees him, he
nearly has one of his apoplectic fits.But in marches Hopper the next
morning with twice the order."He's dangerous," said the Captain, emphatically."The Yankees are changing business in this town," was the Colonel's
answer."We've got to keep the pace, Lige."THE PARTY

To gentle Miss Anne Brinsmade, to Puss Russell of the mischievous eyes,
and even to timid Eugenie Renault, the question that burned was: Would
he come, or would he not?And, secondarily, how would Virginia treat him
if he came?Put our friend Stephen for the subjective, and Miss Carvers
party for the objective in the above, and we have the clew.For very
young girls are given to making much out of a very little in such
matters.If Virginia had not gotten angry when she had been teased a
fortnight before, all would have been well.Even Puss, who walked where angels feared to tread, did not dare to go
too far with Virginia.She had taken care before the day of the party to
beg forgiveness with considerable humility.It had been granted with a
queenly generosity.And after that none of the bevy had dared to broach
the subject to Virginia.He told Puss afterward that
when Virginia got through with him, he felt as if he had taken a rapid
trip through the wheel-house of a large steamer.Puss tried, by
various ingenious devices, to learn whether Mr.These things added a zest to a party long looked forward to amongst
Virginia's intimates.In those days young ladies did not "come out" so
frankly as they do now.Mothers did not announce to the world that they
possessed marriageable daughters.And then the matrimonial market was feverishly active.Young
men proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a
walk,--and were refused quite as naturally.An offer of marriage was not
the fearful and wonderful thing--to be dealt with gingerly--which it has
since become.Seventeen was often the age at which they began.And one
of the big Catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at
Virginia's feet once a month.Nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she
laughed at him.It was with a flutter of excitement, therefore, that Miss Carvel's
guests flitted past Jackson, who held the door open obsequiously.The
boldest of them took a rapid survey of the big parlor, before they put
foot on the stairs to see whether Mr.And if
their curiosity held them too long, they were usually kissed by the
Colonel.Carvel shook hands heartily with the young mean and called them by
their first names, for he knew most of their fathers and grandfathers.And if an older gentleman arrived, perhaps the two might be seen going
down the hall together, arm in arm.So came his beloved enemy, Judge
Whipple, who did not make an excursion to the rear regions of the house
with the Colonel; but they stood and discussed Mr.President Buchanan's
responsibility for the recent panic, until the band, which Mr.Hopper
had stationed under the stairs, drowned their voices.As we enter the room, there stands Virginia under the rainbowed prisms
of the great chandelier, receiving.But here was suddenly a woman of
twenty-eight, where only this evening we knew a slip of a girl.It was
a trick she had, to become majestic in a ball-gown.She held her head
high, as a woman should, and at her slender throat glowed the pearls of
Dorothy Manners.The result of all this was to strike a little awe into the souls of many
of her playmates.Little Eugenie nearly dropped a curtsey.Belle Cluyme
was so impressed that she forgot for a whole hour to be spiteful.But
Puss Russell kissed her on both cheeks, and asked her if she really
wasn't nervous.But she said
nothing to her hostess, for fear of marring an otherwise happy occasion.She retired with Jack Brim made to a corner, where she recited:--

     "Oh young Lochinvar is come out of the East;
     Of millions of Yankees I love him the least."Clarence Colfax, resplendent in new evening clothes just
arrived from New York, was pressing his claim for the first dance with
his cousin in opposition to numerous other claims, the chatter of the
guests died away.Virginia turned her head, and for an instant the
pearls trembled on her neck.There was a young man cordially and
unconcernedly shaking hands with her father and Captain Lige.Her memory
of that moment is, strangely, not of his face (she did not deign to
look at that), but of the muscle of his shoulder half revealed as he
stretched forth his arm."Virginia," he whispered earnestly, almost fiercely, "Virginia, who
invited him here?""I did," said Virginia, calmly, "of course.cried Clarence, "do you know who he is?""Yes," she answered, "I know.And is that any reason why he should not
come here as a guest?Would you bar any gentleman from your house on
account of his convictions?"Ah, Virginia, who had thought to hear that argument from your lips?What
would frank Captain Lige say of the consistency of women, if he heard
you now?And how give an account of yourself to Anne Brinsmade?What
contrariness has set you so intense against your own argument?Clarence can recover from his
astonishment and remind her of her vehement words on the subject at
Bellegarde, Mr.Stephen is making thither with the air of one who
conquers.Has he no shame that he should hold his head so high?She feels her color mounting, even as her resentment rises at his
self-possession, and yet she would have despised him had he shown
self-consciousness in gait or manner in the sight of her assembled
guests.Nearly as tall as the Colonel himself, he is plainly seen, and
Miss Puss in her corner does not have to stand on tiptoe.Carvel
does the honors of the introduction.But a daughter of the Carvels was not to fail before such a paltry
situation as this.Shall it be confessed that curiosity stepped into the
breach?As she gave him her hand she was wondering how he would act.As a matter of fact he acted detestably.He said nothing whatever, but
stood regarding her with a clear eye and a face by far too severe.The thought that he was meditating on the incident of the auction sale
crossed through her mind, and made her blood simmer.An evil spirit took
possession of Virginia.Brice, do you know my cousin, Mr.To this new phase his sense of humor
did not rise.Brice was a Yankee and no gentleman, inasmuch as he
had overbid a lady for Hester."Have you come here to live, Mr."Yes," he said, "if I can presently make enough to keep me alive."Then
turning to Virginia, he said, "Will you dance, Miss Carvel?"The effrontery of this demand quite drew the breath from the impatient
young gentlemen who had been waiting their turn.Several of them spoke
up in remonstrance.And for the moment (let one confess it who knows),
Virginia was almost tempted to lay her arm in his.Then she made a bow
that would have been quite as effective the length of the room.Brice," she said, "but I am engaged to Mr.Abstractedly he watched her glide away in her cousin's arms.Stephen had
a way of being preoccupied at such times.When he grew older he
would walk the length of Olive Street, look into face after face
of acquaintances, not a quiver of recognition in his eyes.But most
probably the next week he would win a brilliant case in the Supreme
Court.And so now, indifferent to the amusement of some about him, he
stood staring after Virginia and Clarence.Where had he seen Colfax's
face before he came West?Many, many years before he
had stood with his father in the mellow light of the long gallery at
Hollingdean, Kent, before a portrait of the Stuarts' time.The face was
that of one of Lord Northwell's ancestors, a sporting nobleman of the
time of the second Charles.It was a head which compelled one to pause
before it.Strangely enough,--it was the head likewise of Clarence
Colfax.The image of it Stephen had carried undimmed in the eye of his memory.White-haired Northwell's story, also.Brice
had expected his small son to grasp.As a matter of fact Stephen had not
grasped it then--but years afterward.It was not a pleasant story,--and
yet there was much of credit in it to the young rake its subject,--of
dash and courage and princely generosity beside the profligacy and
incontinence.The face had impressed him, with its story.He had often dreamed of it,
and of the lace collar over the dull-gold velvet that became it so well.And here it was at last, in a city west of the Mississippi River.Here
were the same delicately chiselled features, with their pallor, and
satiety engraved there at one and twenty.Here was the same lazy scorn
in the eyes, and the look which sleeplessness gives to the lids: the
hair, straight and fine and black; the wilful indulgence--not of one
life, but of generations--about the mouth; the pointed chin.And yet it
was a fact to dare anything, and to do anything.One thing more ere we have done with that which no man may explain.Had
he dreamed, too, of the girl?Stephen might not tell, but
thrice had the Colonel spoken to him before he answered."You must meet some of these young ladies, sir."It was little wonder that Puss Russell thought him dull on that first
occasion.Out of whom condescension is to flow is a matter of which
Heaven takes no cognizance.To use her own words, Puss thought him
"stuck up," when he should have been grateful.We know that Stephen
was not stuck up, and later Miss Russell learned that likewise.Very
naturally she took preoccupation for indifference.It is a matter worth
recording, however, that she did not tease him, because she did not
dare.He did not ask her to dance, which was rude.Carvel, who introduced him to Miss Renault and Miss Saint
Cyr, and other young ladies of the best French families.And finally,
drifting hither and thither with his eyes on Virginia, in an evil moment
he was presented to Mrs.Colfax was a very great lady indeed, albeit the daughter of an overseer.She bore Addison Colfax's name, spent his fortune, and retained her good
looks.On this particular occasion she was enjoying herself quite as
much as any young girl in the room, and, while resting from a waltz, was
regaling a number of gentlemen with a humorous account of a scandal at
the Virginia Spring's.None but a great lady could have meted out the punishment administered
to poor Stephen.None but a great lady could have concerned it.And he,
who had never been snubbed before, fell headlong into her trap.How
was the boy to know that there was no heart in the smile with which she
greeted him?She continued to talk about
Virginia Springs, "Oh, Mr.Brice, of course you have been there.Charles, you look
as if you were just dying to waltz.Let's have a turn before the music
stops."And so she whirled away, leaving Stephen forlorn, a little too angry to
be amused just then.In that state he spied a gentleman coming towards
him--a gentleman the sight of whom he soon came to associate with all
that is good and kindly in this world, Mr.And now he put his
hand on Stephen's shoulder.Whether he had seen the incident just past,
who can tell?"My son," said he, "I am delighted to see you here.Now that we are such
near neighbors, we must be nearer friends.You must know my wife, and my
son Jack, and my daughter Anne."Brinsmade was a pleasant little body, but plainly not a fit mate
for her husband.Jack gave Stephen a warm grasp of the hand, and
an amused look.As for Anne, she was more like her father; she was
Stephen's friend from that hour."I have seen you quite often, going in at your gate, Mr.And
I have seen your mother, too."She has such a
wonderful face."And the girl raised her truthful blue eyes to his."My mother would be delighted to know you," he ventured, not knowing
what else to say.Daniel went to the hallway.It was an effort for him to reflect upon their new
situation as poor tenants to a wealthy family."I shall call on her to-morrow, with
mother.Brice," she continued, "do you know that your
mother is just the person I should go to if I were in trouble, whether I
knew her or not?""I have found her a good person in trouble," said Stephen, simply.He
might have said the same of Anne.She had thought him cold, but these words belied
that.She had wrapped him in that diaphanous substance with which young
ladies (and sometimes older ones) are wont to deck their heroes.She had
approached a mystery--to find it human, as are many mysteries.But thank
heaven that she found a dignity, a seriousness,--and these more than
satisfied her.Likewise, she discovered something she had not looked
for, an occasional way of saying things that made her laugh.She danced
with him, and passed him back to Miss Puss Russell, who was better
pleased this time; she passed him on to her sister, who also danced with
him, and sent him upstairs for her handkerchief.As the evening wore on, he was more
and more aware of an uncompromising attitude in his young hostess, whom
he had seen whispering to various young ladies from behind her fan as
they passed her.He had not felt equal to asking her to dance a second
time.Honest Captain Lige Breast, who seemed to have taken a fancy to
him, bandied him on his lack of courage with humor that was a little
rough.And, to Stephen's amazement, even Judge Whipple had pricked him
on.It was on his way upstairs after Emily Russell's handkerchief that
he ran across another acquaintance.Eliphalet Hopper, in Sunday
broadcloth, was seated on the landing, his head lowered to the level of
the top of the high door of the parlor.Stephen caught a glimpse of the
picture whereon his eyes were fixed.Perhaps it is needless to add that
Miss Virginia Carvel formed the central figure of it.Hopper, and added darkly: "I ain't in no hurry.Just
now they callate I'm about good enough to manage the business end of
an affair like this here.But some day," said he,
suddenly barring Stephen's way, "some day I'll give a party.And hark to
me when I tell you that these here aristocrats 'll be glad enough to get
invitations."The
incident was all that was needed to dishearten and disgust him.Kindly
as he had been treated by others, far back in his soul was a thing that
rankled.Shall it be told crudely why he went that night?Stephen
Brice, who would not lie to others, lied to himself.And when he came
downstairs again and presented Miss Emily with her handkerchief,
his next move was in his mind.And that was to say good-night to the
Colonel, and more frigidly to Miss Carvel herself.But music has upset
many a man's calculations.The strains of the Jenny Lind waltz were beginning to float through the
rooms.There was Miss Virginia in a corner of the big parlor, for the
moment alone with her cousin.Not a
sign did she give of being aware of his presence until he stood before
her.But she said: "So you have
come at last to try again, Mr.Brice said: "If you will do me the honor, Miss Carvel."Clarence Colfax got to his feet.Then she
looked up at the two men as they stood side by side, and perhaps swept
them both in an instant's comparison.The New Englander's face must have reminded her more of her own father,
Colonel Carvel.It possessed, from generations known, the power to
control itself.She afterwards admitted that she accepted him to tease
Clarence.Miss Russell, whose intuitions are usually correct, does not
believe this."I will dance with you," said Virginia.But, once in his arms, she seemed like a wild thing, resisting.Although
her gown brushed his coat, the space between them was infinite, and her
hand lay limp in his, unresponsive of his own pressure.Not so her feet;
they caught the step and moved with the rhythm of the music, and round
the room they swung.More than one pair paused in the dance to watch
them.Then, as they glided past the door, Stephen was disagreeably
conscious of some one gazing down from above, and he recalled Eliphalet
Hopper and his position.The sneer from Eliphalet's seemed to penetrate
like a chilly draught.All at once, Virginia felt her partner gathering up his strength, and
by some compelling force, more of wild than of muscle, draw her nearer.Unwillingly her hand tightened under his, and her blood beat faster
and her color came and went as they two moved as one.Anger--helpless
anger--took possession of her as she saw the smiles on the faces of her
friends, and Puss Russell mockingly throwing a kiss as she passed her.And then, strange in the telling, a thrill as of power rose within her
which she strove against in vain.A knowledge of him who guided her so
swiftly, so unerringly, which she had felt with no other man.Faster and
faster they stepped, each forgetful of self and place, until the waltz
came suddenly to a stop.said Captain Lige to Judge Whipple, "you can whollop me on my
own forecastle if they ain't the handsomest couple I ever did see."CHAPTER I. RAW MATERIAL

Summer, intolerable summer, was upon the city at last.The families of
its richest citizens had fled.Even at that early day some braved the
long railroad journey to the Atlantic coast.Amongst these were our
friends the Cluymes, who come not strongly into this history.But many, like the Brinsmades and the Russells,
the Tiptons and the Hollingsworths, retired to the local paradise of
their country places on the Bellefontaine road, on the cool heights
above the river.Thither, as a respite from the hot office, Stephen was
often invited by kind Mr.Brinsmade, who sometimes drove him out in his
own buggy.But Miss Virginia
Carvel he had never seen since the night he had danced with her.This was because, after her return from the young ladies' school at
Monticello, she had gone to Glencoe, Glencoe, magic spot, perched high
on wooded highlands.And under these the Meramec, crystal pure, ran
lightly on sand and pebble to her bridal with that turbid tyrant, the
Father of Waters.To reach Glencoe you spent two dirty hours on that railroad which
(it was fondly hoped) would one day stretch to the Pacific Ocean.You
generally spied one of the big Catherwood boys in the train, or their
tall sister Maude.The Catherwoods likewise lived at Glencoe in the
summer.And on some Saturday afternoons a grim figure in a linen duster
and a silk skull-cap took a seat in the forward car.That was Judge
Whipple, on his way to spend a quiet Sunday with Colonel Carvel.To the surprise of many good people, the Judge had recently formed
another habit.At least once a week he would drop in at the little house
on Olive Street next to Mr.Brinsmade's big one, which was shut up, and
take tea with Mrs.Afterward he would sit on the little porch
over the garden in the rear, or on the front steps, and watch the
bob-tailed horse-cars go by.His conversation was chiefly addressed to
the widow.Rarely to Stephen; whose wholesome respect for his employer
had in no wise abated.Through the stifling heat of these summer days Stephen sat in the outer
office, straining at the law.Had it not been for the fact that Mr.Whipple went to his mother's house, despair would have seized him long
since.Apparently his goings-out and his comings-in were noted only by
Mr.Truly the Judge's methods were not Harvard methods.And if
there were pride in the young Bostonian, Mr.Whipple thought he knew the
cure for it.It was to Richter Stephen owed a debt of gratitude in these days.He
would often take his midday meal in the down-town beer garden with the
quiet German.Then there came a Sunday afternoon (to be marked with a
red letter) when Richter transported him into Germany itself.The Rhine was
Market Street, and south of that street was a country of which polite
American society took no cognizance.Here was an epic movement indeed, for South St.Louis was a great sod
uprooted from the Fatherland and set down in all its vigorous crudity in
the warm black mud of the Mississippi Valley.Here lager beer took the
place of Bourbon, and black bread and sausages of hot rolls and fried
chicken.Here were quaint market houses squatting in the middle of wide
streets; Lutheran churches, square and uncompromising, and bulky Turner
Halls, where German children were taught the German tongue.Here, in a
shady grove of mulberry and locust, two hundred families were spread out
at their ease.For a while Richter sat in silence, puffing at a meerschaum with a huge
brown bowl.A trick of the mind opened for Stephen one of the histories
in his father's library in Beacon Street, across the pages of which had
flitted the ancestors of this blue-eyed and great-chested Saxon.He saw
them in cathedral forests, with the red hair long upon their bodies.He saw terrifying battles with the Roman Empire surging back and forth
through the low countries.He saw a lad of twenty at the head of rugged
legions clad in wild skins, sweeping Rome out of Gaul.Back in the dim
ages Richter's fathers must have defended grim Eresburg.And it seemed
to him that in the end the new Republic must profit by this rugged
stock, which had good women for wives and mothers, and for fathers men
in whose blood dwelt a fierce patriotism and contempt for cowardice.He thought of the forefathers of
those whom he knew, who dwelt north of Market Street.Many, though this
generation of the French might know it not, had bled at Calais and at
Agincourt, had followed the court of France in clumsy coaches to Blois
and Amboise, or lived in hovels under the castle walls.Others had
charged after the Black Prince at Poitiers, and fought as serf or noble.in the war of the Roses; had been hatters or tailors in Cromwell's
armies, or else had sacrificed lands and fortunes for Charles Stuart.These English had toiled, slow but resistless, over the misty Blue
Ridge after Boone and Harrod to this old St.Louis of the French, their
enemies, whose fur traders and missionaries had long followed the veins
of the vast western wilderness.And now, on to the structure builded by
these two, comes Germany to be welded, to strengthen or to weaken.Richter put down his pipe on the table."Stephen," he said suddenly, "you do not share the prejudice against us
here?"He thought of some vigorous words that Miss Puss
Russell had used on the subject of the Dutch."I am glad," answered Richter, with a note of sadness, in his voice."Do not despise us before you know more of us.We are still feudal in
Germany--of the Middle Ages.He is compelled to
serve the lord of the land every year with so much labor of his hands.The small farmers, the 'Gross' and 'Mittel Bauern', we call them, are
also mortgaged to the nobles who tyrannize our Vaterland.Our merchants
are little merchants--shopkeepers, you would say.My poor father, an
educated man, was such."And now," said Stephen, "why do they not keep their hold?""We were unused to ruling," he answered."We knew not how to act--what
to do.You must remember that we were not trained to govern ourselves,
as are you of the English race, from children.Those who have been for
centuries ground under heel do not make practical parliamentarians.No;
your heritage is liberty--you Americans and English; and we Germans must
desert our native land to partake of it."The eyes of the German filled at the recollection, nor did he seem
ashamed of his tears."I had a poor old father whose life was broken to save the Vaterland,
but not his spirit," he cried, "no, not that.God directed my grandfather to send him to the Kolnisches
gymnasium, where the great Jahn taught.Jahn was our Washington, the
father of Germany that is to be.Our women wore Parisian clothes, and
spoke the language; French immorality and atheism had spread like a
plague among us Napoleon the vile had taken the sword of our Frederick
from Berlin.It was Father Jahn (so we love to call him), it was Father
Jahn who founded the 'Turnschulen', that the generations to come might
return to simple German ways,--plain fare, high principles, our native
tongue; and the development of the body.The downfall of the fiend
Napoleon and the Vaterland united--these two his scholars must have
written in their hearts.All summer long, in their black caps and linen
pantaloons, they would trudge after him, begging a crust here and a
cheese there, to spread his teachings far and wide under the thatched
roofs.I have heard my father tell how in the heat of that
year a great red comet burned in the sky, even as that we now see, my
friend.But in the coming spring
the French conscripts filled our sacred land like a swarm of locusts,
devouring as they went.And at their head, with the pomp of Darius, rode
that destroyer of nations and homes, Napoleon.But the red embers were beneath, fanned by Father Jahn.Napoleon
at Dresden made our princes weep.Never, even in the days of the
Frankish kings, had we been so humbled.He dragged our young men with
him to Russia, and left them to die moaning on the frozen wastes, while
he drove off in his sledge."It was the next year that Germany rose.High and low, rich and poor,
Jaeger and Landwehr, came flocking into the army, and even the old men,
the Landsturm.Russia was an ally, and later, Austria.My father, a last
of sixteen, was in the Landwehr, under the noble Blucher in Silesia,
when they drove the French into the Katzbach and the Neisse, swollen by
the rains into torrents.It had rained until the forests were marshes.But Blucher, ah, there was a man!He whipped his
great sabre from under his cloak, crying 'Vorwarts!And the
Landwehr with one great shout slew their enemies with the butts of their
muskets until their arms were weary and the bodies were tossed like logs
in the foaming waters.They called Blucher Marachall Vorwarts!But the victors quarrelled amongst
themselves, while Talleyrand and Metternich tore our Vaterland into
strips, and set brother against brother.And our blood, and the grief
for the widows and the fatherless, went for nothing.""After a while," he continued presently, "came the German Confederation,
with Austria at the head.Rid of Napoleon, we had another despot in
Metternich.But the tree which Jahn had planted grew, and its branches
spread.My father had gone to
Jena University, when he joined the Burschenschaft, or Students' League,
of which I will tell you later.It was pledged to the rescue of the
Vaterland.He was sent to prison for dipping his handkerchief in the
blood of Sand, beheaded for liberty at Mannheim.Afterwards he was
liberated, and went to Berlin and married my mother, who died when I
was young.Twice again he was in prison because the societies met at his
house.You in America know not the meaning
of that word.His health broke, and when '48 came, he was an old man.His hair was white, and he walked the streets with a crutch.But he had
saved a little money to send me to Jena.I was big-boned and fair, like my mother.And when
I came home at the end of a Semester I can see him now, as he
would hobble to the door, wearing the red and black and gold of the
Burschenschaft.And he would keep me up half the night-telling him of
our 'Schlager' fights with the aristocrats.My father had been a noted
swordsman in his day."For Stephen was staring at the jagged
scar, He had never summoned the courage to ask Richter how he came by
it."Broadswords," answered the German, hastily."Some day I will tell you
of them, and of the struggle with the troops in the 'Breite Strasse' in
March.We lost, as I told you because we knew not how to hold what we
had gained."I left Germany, hoping to make a home here for my poor father.How sad
his face as he kissed me farewell!And he said to me: 'Carl, if ever
your new Vaterland, the good Republic, be in danger, sacrifice all.I have spent my years in bondage, and I say to you that life without
liberty is not worth the living.'Three months I was gone, and he was
dead, without that for which he had striven so bravely.He never knew
what it is to have an abundance of meat.He never knew from one day to
the other when he would have to embrace me, all he owned, and march away
to prison, because he was a patriot."Richter's voice had fallen low,
but now he raised it."Do you think, my friend," he cried, "do you think
that I would not die willingly for this new country if the time should
come.Yes, and there are a million like me, once German, now American,
who will give their lives to preserve this Union.For without it the
world is not fit to live in."Stephen had food for thought as he walked northward through the strange
streets on that summer evening.Here indeed was a force not to be
reckoned, and which few had taken into account.ABRAHAM LINCOLN

It is sometimes instructive to look back and see hour Destiny gave us a
kick here, and Fate a shove there, that sent us in the right direction
at the proper time.And when Stephen Brice looks backward now, he laughs
to think that he did not suspect the Judge of being an ally of the
two who are mentioned above.Whipple's words and
advices to him that summer had been these.Stephen was dressed more
carefully than usual, in view of a visit to Bellefontaine Road.Whereupon the Judge demanded whether he were contemplating marriage.Without waiting for a reply he pointed to a rope and a slab of limestone
on the pavement below, and waved his hand unmistakably toward the
Mississippi.Whipple had once been crossed
in love.But we are to speak more particularly of a put-up job, although Stephen
did not know this at the time.Towards five o'clock of a certain afternoon in August of that year,
1858, Mr.Instead of turning to the right,
he strode straight to Stephen's table.His communications were always a
trifle startling.Brice," said he, "you are to take the six forty-five train on the
St.Louis, Alton, and Chicago road tomorrow morning for Springfield,
Illinois.""Arriving at Springfield, you are to deliver this envelope into the
hands of Mr.Abraham Lincoln, of the law firm of Lincoln & Herndon."cried Stephen, rising and straddling his chair."But,
sir--"

"Abraham Lincoln," interrupted the Judge, forcibly "I try to speak
plainly, sir.If he
is not in Springfield, find out where he is and follow him up.And he knew better than to argue the matter with Mr.He had read in the Missouri Democrat of this man Lincoln,
a country lawyer who had once been to Congress, and who was even now
disputing the senatorship of his state with the renowned Douglas.In
spite of their complacent amusement, he had won a little admiration
from conservative citizens who did not believe in the efficacy of Judge
Douglas's Squatter Sovereignty.Lincoln, who had once
been a rail-sputter, was uproariously derided by Northern Democrats
because he had challenged Mr.Douglas to seven debates, to be held at
different towns in the state of Illinois.David with his sling and
his smooth round pebble must have had much of the same sympathy and
ridicule.Douglas, Senator and Judge, was a national character, mighty in
politics, invulnerable in the armor of his oratory.And he was known
far and wide as the Little Giant.Those whom he did not conquer with his
logic were impressed by his person.Stephen remembered with a thrill that these debates were going on now.One, indeed, had been held, and had appeared in fine print in a corner
of the Democrat.Perhaps this Lincoln might not be in; Springfield;
perhaps he, Stephen Brice, might, by chance, hit upon a debate, and see
and hear the tower of the Democracy, the Honorable Stephen A. Douglas.But it is greatly to be feared that our friend Stephen was bored
with his errand before he arrived at the little wooden station of the
Illinois capital.Standing on the platform after the train pulled out,
he summoned up courage to ask a citizen with no mustache and a beard,
which he swept away when he spat, where was the office of Lincoln &
Herndon.Brice pityingly,
and finally led him in silence past the picket fence and the New
England-looking meeting-house opposite until they came to the great
square on which the State House squatted.The State House was a building
with much pretension to beauty, built in the classical style, of a
yellow stone, with sold white blinds in the high windows and mighty
columns capped at the gently slanting roof.But on top of it was reared
a crude wooden dome, like a clay head on a marble statue."That there," said the stranger, "is whar we watches for the County
Delegations when they come in to a meetin'."And with this remark,
pointing with a stubby thumb up a well-worn stair, he departed before
Stephen could thank him.Stephen paused under the awning, of which there
were many shading the brick pavement, to regard the straggling line of
stores and houses which surrounded and did homage to the yellow pile.Lincoln's office was had decorations above
the windows.Mounting the stair, Stephen found a room bare enough, save
for a few chairs and law books, and not a soul in attendance.After
sitting awhile by the window, mopping his brow with a handkerchief, he
went out on the landing to make inquiries.There he met another citizen
in shirt sleeves, like unto the first, in the very act of sweeping his
beard out of the way of a dexterous expectoration."Wal, young man," said he, "who be you lookin' for here?"At this the gentleman sat down on the dirty top step; and gave vent to
quiet but annoying laughter."I reckon you come to the wrong place.""I was told this was his office," said Stephen, with some heat."I don't see what that has to do with it," answered our friend."Wal," said the citizen, critically, "if you was from Philadelphy or
Boston, you might stand acquitted."Stephen was on the point of claiming Boston, but wisely hesitated."Ye talk like y e was from down East," said the citizens who seemed in
the humor for conversation."I reckon old Abe's' too busy to see you.Say, young man, did you ever hear of Stephen Arnold Douglas, alias the
Little Giant, alias the Idol of our State, sir?"This was too much for Stephen, who left the citizen without the
compliment of a farewell.Continuing around the square, inquiring for
Mr.Lincoln's house, he presently got beyond the stores and burning
pavements on to a plank walk, under great shade trees, and past old
brick mansions set well back from the street.At length he paused in
front of a wooden house of a dirty grayish brown, too high for its
length and breadth, with tall shutters of the same color, and a picket
fence on top of the retaining wall which lifted the yard above the plank
walk.But an ugly house may look beautiful
when surrounded by such heavy trees as this was.Their shade was
the most inviting thing Stephen had seen.A boy of sixteen or so was
swinging on the gate, plainly a very mischievous boy, with a round,
laughing, sunburned face and bright eyes.In front of the gate was a
shabby carriage with top and side curtains, hitched to a big bay horse."Well, I guess," said the boy."I'm his son, and he lives right here
when he's at home.asked Stephen, beginning to realize the purport of his
conversations with citizens.Lincoln mentioned the name of a small town in the northern
part of the state, where he said his father would stop that night.He
told Stephen that he looked wilted, invited him into the house to have
a glass of lemonade, and to join him and another boy in a fishing
excursion with the big bay horse.Lincoln that he
should have to take the first train after his father.exclaimed the other, enviously, "then you'll hear the Freeport
debate."Now it has been said that the day was scorching hot.And when Stephen
had got back to the wooden station, and had waited an hour for the
Bloomington express, his anxiety to hear the Freeport debate was not
as keen as it might have been.Late in the afternoon he changed at
Bloomington to the Illinois Central Railroad: The sun fell down behind
the cardboard edge of the prairie, the train rattled on into the north,
wrapped in its dust and Smoke, and presently became a long comet,
roaring red, to match that other comet which flashed in the sky.By this time it may be said that our friend was heartily sick of his
mission, He tried to doze; but two men, a farmer and a clerk, got in
at a way station, and sat behind him.They began to talk about this man
Lincoln."Shucks," said the clerk, "think of him opposing the Little Giant.""He's right smart, Sam," said the farmer."He's got a way of sayin'
things that's clear.But Steve Douglas, he only
mixes you up.""Because you ain't had no education: What
does a rail-sputter like Abe know about this government?Let the territories take care of
themselves.The fust of this week I
seen him side-tracked down the road here in a caboose, while Doug went
by in a special.""Abe is a plain man, Sam," the farmer answered solemnly.It was ten o'clock when Stephen descended at his destination.Merciful
night hid from his view the forlorn station and the ragged town.The
baggage man told him that Mr.Will words describe the impression it made on a certain
young man from Boston!It was long and low and ramshackly and hot that
night as the inside of a brick-kiln.As he drew near it on the single
plant walk over the black prairie-mud, he saw countrymen and politicians
swarming its narrow porch and narrower hall.Discussions in all keys
were in progress, and it, was with vast difficulty that our distracted
young man pushed through and found the landlord, This personage was the
coolest of the lot.Confusion was but food for his smiles, importunity
but increased his suavity.And of the seeming hundreds that pressed him,
he knew and utilized the Christian name of all.From behind a corner of
the bar he held them all at bay, and sent them to quarters like the old
campaigner he was."Now, Ben, tain't no use gettin' mad.You, and Josh way, an' Will, an'
Sam, an' the Cap'n, an' the four Beaver brothers, will all sleep in
number ten.No, sirree, the Honerable Abe, and
Mister Hill, and Jedge Oglesby is sleepin' in seven."The smell of
perspiration was stifling as Stephen pushed up to the master of the
situation.Gosh, I reckon if you can fight your way to the dinin' room, the gals'll
give you some pork and a cup of coffee."After a preliminary scuffle with a drunken countryman in mud-caked
boots, Mr.Brice presently reached the long table in the dining-room.A sense of humor not quite extinct made him smile as he devoured pork
chops and greasy potatoes and heavy apple pie.As he was finishing the
pie, he became aware of the tavern keeper standing over him."Are you one of them flip Chicagy reporters?"asked that worthy, with a
suspicious eye on Stephen's clothes."You didn't talk jest like 'em.Guess you'll be here, tonight--"

"Yes," said Stephen, wearily.And he added, outs of force of habit, "Can
you give me a room?""Number ten, There ain't nobody in
there but Ben Billings, and the four Beaver brothers, an' three more.I'll have a shake-down for ye next the north window."Stephen's thanks for the hospitality perhaps lacked heartiness.But
perceiving his host still contemplating him, he was emboldened to say:

"Has Mr.Stephen's reflections here on the dignity of the Senatorial candidate of
the Republican Party in Illinois were novel, at any rate.He thought of
certain senators he had seen in Massachusetts."The only reason he ain't down here swappin' yarns with the boys, is
because he's havin' some sort of confab with the Jedge and Joe Medill of
the 'Chicagy Press' and 'Tribune'."He was
emboldened by the apparent lack of ceremony of the candidate.The
landlord looked at him in some surprise.Jest go up an' knock at the door number seven, and say
Tom Wright sent ye.""Pick out the ugliest man in the room.There ain't nobody I kin think of
uglier than Abe."Bearing in mind this succinct description of the candidate, Stephen
climbed the rickety stairs to the low second story.All the bedroom
doors were flung open except one, on which the number 7 was inscribed.From within came bursts of uproarious laughter, and a summons to enter.He pushed open the door, and as soon as his eyes became, accustomed to
the tobacco smoke, he surveyed the room.There was a bowl on the
floor, the chair where it belonged being occupied.There was a very
inhospitable looking bed, two shake-downs, and four Windsor chairs in
more or less state of dilapidation--all occupied likewise.A country
glass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf, and under it a young man sat
absorbed in making notes, and apparently oblivious to the noise around
him.Every gentleman in the room was collarless, coatless, tieless,
and vestless.Some were engaged in fighting gnats and June bugs, while
others battled with mosquitoes--all save the young man who wrote, he
being wholly indifferent.Stephen picked out the homeliest man in the room.And, instead of a discussion of the campaign with the other
gentlemen, Mr.Lincoln was
defending an occasional and judicious use of swear words."Judge," said he, "you do an almighty lot of cussing in your speeches,
and perhaps it ain't a bad way to keep things stirred up.""Well," said the Judge, "a fellow will rip out something once in a while
before he has time to shut it off."Lincoln passed his fingers through his tousled hair.His thick
lower lip crept over in front of the upper one, A gleam stirred in the
deep-set gray eyes."Boys," he asked, "did I ever tell you about Sam'l, the old Quaker's
apprentice?"There was a chorus of "No's" and "Go ahead, Abe?"The young man who was
writing dropped his pencil.As for Stephen, this long, uncouth man
of the plains was beginning to puzzle him.The face, with its crude
features and deep furrows, relaxed into intense soberness.Lincoln began his story with a slow earnestness that was truly
startling, considering the subject."This apprentice, Judge, was just such an incurable as you.""And Sam'l, when he wanted to, could get out as many cusses in a second
as his anvil shot sparks.And the old man used to wrastle with him
nights and speak about punishment, and pray for him in meeting.When anything went wrong, Sam'l had an appropriate
word for the occasion.One day the old man got an inspiration when he
was scratching around in the dirt for an odd-sized iron."'Sam'l,' says he, 'I want thee.'"Sam'l went, and found the old man standing over a big rat hole, where
the rats came out to feed on the scraps."'Sam'l,' says he, 'fetch the tongs.'"Sam'l fetched the tongs."'Now, Sam'l,' says the old man, 'thou wilt sit here until thou hast
a rat.And when thou hast him, if I hear thee
swear, thou wilt sit here until thou hast another.Lincoln seized two cotton umbrellas, rasped his chair over the
bare boor into a corner of the room, and sat hunched over an imaginary
rat hole, for all the world like a gawky Quaker apprentice.And this was
a candidate for the Senate of the United States, who on the morrow was
to meet in debate the renowned and polished Douglas!Lincoln continued, "that was on a Monday, I reckon, and the
boys a-shouting to have their horses shod.Maybe you think they didn't
have some fun with Sam'l.But Sam'l sat there, and sat there, and sat
there, and after a while the old man pulled out his dinner-pail.First thing you know, snip went the tongs.""What do you reckon Sam'l said, Judge?"The Judge, at random, summoned up a good one, to the delight of the
audience.Lincoln, with solemnity, "I reckon that's what you'd
have said.Sam'l never said a word, and the old man kept on eating his
dinner.One o'clock came, and the folks began to drop in again, but
Sam'l, he sat there.'Long towards night the boys collected 'round the
door.Lincoln bent forward a little, and his voice fell to a loud,
drawling whisper."First thing you know, here come the whiskers peeping
up, then the pink eyes a--blinking at the forge, then--!""Suddenly he brought the umbrellas together with whack."'By God,' yells Sam'l, 'I have thee at last!'"Lincoln stood up, his long body swaying to and fro
as he lifted high the improvised tongs.They heard a terrified squeal,
and there was the rat squirming and wriggling,--it seemed before
their very eyes.And Stephen forgot the country tavern, the country
politician, and was transported straightway into the Quaker's smithy.IN WHICH STEPHEN LEARNS SOMETHING

It was Mr.The astonishing candidate for
the Senate had sunk into his chair, his face relaxed into sadness save
for the sparkle lurking in the eyes.So he sat, immobile, until the
laughter had died down to silence."Sonny," he said, "did you want to see me?"Stephen was determined to be affable and kind, and (shall we say it?)Lincoln uncomfortable either by a superiority of
English or the certain frigidity of manner which people in the West said
he had.But he tried to imagine a Massachusetts senator, Mr.Sumner,
for instance, going through the rat story, and couldn't.Somehow,
Massachusetts senators hadn't this gift.And yet he was not quite sure
that it wasn't a fetching gift.Stephen did not quite like to be
called "Sonny."But he looked into two gray eyes, and at the face, and
something curious happened to him.How was he to know that thousands of
his countrymen were to experience the same sensation?Lincoln again, "did you want to see me?"He
drew from his inner pocket the envelope which the Judge had given him.He put
the document in his tall hat, which was upside down on the floor.As he
got deeper into the letter, he pursed his mouth, and the lines of his
face deepened in a smile."Judge Whipple told you to run till you found me, did he, Mr."Is the Judge the same old criss-cross, contrary, violent fool that he
always was?"Providence put an answer in Stephen's mouth."He's been very good to me, Mr."Why, he's the biggest-hearted man I know.You know him, Oglesby,--Silas
Whipple.But a man has to be a Daniel or a General Putnam to venture
into that den of his.There's only one man in the world who can beard
Silas, and he's the finest states-right Southern gentleman you ever saw.You've heard of him, Oglesby.Don't they quarrel
once in a while, Mr."They do have occasional arguments," said Stephen, amused.Lincoln; "well, I couldn't come as near to
fighting every day and stand it.If my dog and Bill's dog across the
street walked around each other and growled for half a day, and then
lay down together, as Carvel and Whipple do, by Jing, I'd put pepper on
their noses--"

"I reckon Colonel Carvel isn't a fighting man," said some one, at
random.Strangely enough, Stephen was seized with a desire to vindicate the
Colonel's courage.Lincoln and Judge Oglesby forestalled him."Why, the other day--"

"Now, Oglesby," put in Mr.Lincoln, "I wanted to tell that story."Stephen had heard it, and so have we.Lincoln's imitation of the
Colonel's drawl brought him a pang like homesickness."'No, suh, I didn't intend to shoot.But he wriggled and twisted like a rattlesnake, and I just couldn't
resist, suh.Then I sent m'<DW65> Ephum to tell him not to let me catch
sight of him 'round the Planters' House.Yes, suh, that's what he was.One of these damned Yankees who come South and go into <DW65>-deals and
politics."'Lincoln glanced at Stephen, and then again at the Judge's letter.He
took up his silk hat and thrust that, too, into the worn lining, which
was already filled with papers.He clapped the hat on his head, and
buttoned on his collar."I reckon I'll go for a walk, boys," he said, "and clear my head, so as
to be ready for the Little Giant to-morrow at Freeport.Brice, do
you feel like walking?"Stephen, taken aback, said that he did."Now, Abe, this is just durned foolishness," one of the gentlemen
expostulated."We want to know if you're going to ask Douglas that
question.""If you do, you kill yourself, Lincoln," said another, who Stephen
afterwards learned was Mr.Medill, proprietor of the great 'Press and
Tribune'."I guess I'll risk it, Joe," said Mr.Suddenly comes
the quiver about the corners of his mouth and the gray eyes respond."Boys," said he, "did you ever hear the story of farmer Bell, down in
Egypt?I'll tell it to you, boys, and then perhaps you'll know why I'll
ask Judge Douglas that question.Farmer Bell had the prize Bartlett pear
tree, and the prettiest gal in that section.And he thought about the
same of each of 'em.But there
was only one who had any chance of getting her, and his name was Jim
Rickets.Jim was the handsomest man in that section.But Jim had a good deal out of life,--all the appetites, and some
of the gratifications.He liked Sue, and he liked a luscious Bartlett.And it just so happened that that prize
pear tree had a whopper on that year, and old man Bell couldn't talk of
anything else."Now there was an ugly galoot whose name isn't worth mentioning.He knew
he wasn't in any way fit for Sue, and he liked pears about as well as
Jim Rickets.Well, one night here comes Jim along the road, whistling;
to court Susan, and there was the ugly galoot a-yearning on the bank
under the pear tree.Jim was all fixed up, and he says to the galoot,
'Let's have a throw.'Now the galoot knew old Bell was looking over
the fence So he says, 'All right,' and he gives Jim the first shot--Jim
fetched down the big pear, got his teeth in it, and strolled off to the
house, kind of pitiful of the galoot for a, half-witted ass.When he got
to the door, there was the old man.'Why,' says Rickets, in his off-hand way, for he always had great
confidence, 'to fetch Sue.'""The old man used to wear brass toes to keep his boots from wearing
out," said Mr.Lincoln, "you see the galoot knew that Jim
Rickets wasn't to be trusted with Susan Bell."Some of the gentlemen appeared to see the point of this political
parable, for they laughed uproariously.Then
they slapped their knees, looked at Mr.Lincoln's face, which was
perfectly sober, and laughed again, a little fainter.Then the Judge
looked as solemn as his title."It won't do, Abe," said he."You'd better stick to the pear, Abe," said Mr.Medill, "and fight
Stephen A. Douglas here and now."Why, yes, Joe," said Mr."He's a man with tens of
thousands of blind followers.It's my business to make some of those
blind followers see."By this time Stephen was burning to know the question that Mr.Lincoln
wished to ask the Little Giant, and why the other gentlemen were against
it.Lincoln surprised him still further in taking him by the
arm.Hill, who had finished his
writing, he said:

"Bob, a little air will do you good.I've had enough of the old boys for
a while, and I'm going to talk to somebody any own age."Stephen was halfway down the corridor when he discovered that he had
forgotten his hat.As he returned he heard somebody say:

"If that ain't just like Abe.He stopped to pull a flea out of his
stocking when he was going to fight that duel with Shields, and now he's
walking with boys before a debate with the smartest man in this country.And there's heaps of things he ought to discuss with us.""Reckon we haven't got much to do with it," said another, half laughing,
half rueful."There's some things Abe won't stand."Lincoln threading his way through the
crowd below, laughing at one, pausing to lay his hand on the shoulder
of another, and replying to a rough sally of a third to make the place a
tumult of guffaws.But none had the temerity to follow him.When
Stephen caught up with him in the little country street, he was talking
earnestly to Mr.Hill, the young reporter of the Press and Tribune.And
what do you think was the subject?Lincoln's strides, another
shock in store for him.This rail-splitter, this postmaster, this
flat-boatman, whom he had not credited with a knowledge of the New Code,
was talking Astronomy.Lincoln, "can you elucidate the problem of the three
bodies?"The talk then fell upon novels and stories, a few of which Mr.He spoke, among others, of the "Gold Bug.""The
story is grand," said he, "but it might as well have been written of
Robinson Crusoe's island.What a fellow wants in a book is to know where
he is.There are not many novels, or ancient works for that matter, that
put you down anywhere.""There is that genuine fragment which Cicero has preserved from a last
work of Aristotle," said Mr."'If there were beings who
lived in the depths of the earth, and could emerge through the open
fissures, and could suddenly behold the earth, the sea, and the--vault
of heaven--'"

"But you--you impostor," cried Mr.Lincoln, interrupting, "you're giving
us Humboldt's Cosmos."It is remarkable how soon we accustom ourselves to a strange situation.And to Stephen it was no less strange to be walking over a muddy road of
the prairie with this most singular man and a newspaper correspondent,
than it might have been to the sub-terrestrial inhabitant to emerge on
the earth's surface.Stephen's mind was in the process of a chemical
change: Suddenly it seemed to him as if he had known this tall
Illinoisan always.The whim of the senatorial candidate in choosing him
for a companion he did not then try to account for.Lincoln, presently, "where do you hail
from?""And how does it happen that you
come to me with a message from a rank Abolitionist lawyer in St."Is the Judge a friend of yours, sir?"Lincoln, "didn't he tell you he was?""He said nothing at all, sir, except to tell me to travel until I found
you.""I call the Judge a friend of mine," said Mr."He may not claim
me because I do not believe in putting all slave-owners to the sword.""I do not think that Judge Whipple is precisely an Abolitionist, sir."It was rare with him, and he must have
caught it from Mr."I am not for ripping out the dam suddenly, sir, that would drown the
nation.I believe that the water can be drained off in some other way."Lincoln's direct answer to this was to give Stephen stinging slap
between the shoulder-blades.Bob, take that
down for the Press and Tribune as coming from a rising young politician
of St."Why," Stephen blurted out, "I--I thought you were an Abolitionist, Mr.Lincoln, "I have as much use for the Boston
Liberator as I have for the Charleston Courier.The question is not whether we shall or shall not have slavery,
but whether slavery shall stay where it is, or be extended according to
Judge Douglas's ingenious plan.I am
for cauterizing the sore so that it shall not spread.Brice, that this nation cannot exist half slave and half free."Was it the slap on the back that opened Stephen's eyes?It was certain
that as they returned to the tavern the man at his side was changed.He
need not have felt chagrined.Men in high places underestimated Lincoln,
or did not estimate him at all.The great warm
heart had claimed Stephen as it claimed all who came near it.The tavern was deserted save for a few stragglers.Under the dim light
at the bar Mr.Lincoln took off his hat and drew the Judge's letter from
the lining.Stephen," said he, "would you like to come to Freeport with me
to-morrow and hear the debate?"An hour earlier he would have declined with thanks.Now his
face lighted at the prospect, and suddenly fell again.He laid his hand on the young man's shoulder, and
laughed."I reckon you're thinking of what the Judge will say.""I'll take care of the Judge," said Mr.He drew forth from the inexhaustible hat a slip of paper, and
began to write."There," said he, when he had finished, "a friend of mine is going to
Springfield in the morning, and he'll send that to the Judge."And this is what he had written:--

     "I have borrowed Steve for a day or two, and guarantee
     to return him a good Republican.It is worth remarking that this was the first time Mr.Brice had been
called "Steve" and had not resented it.Lincoln, but that
gentleman's quizzical look cut him short.And the next remark made him
gasp."Look here, Steve," said he, "you know a parlor from a drawing-room.What did you think of me when you saw me to-night?"Stephen blushed furiously, and his tongue clave to the roof of his
mouth.Lincoln, with his characteristic smile, "you
thought that you wouldn't pick me out of a bunch of horses to race with
the Senator."THE QUESTION

Many times since Abraham Lincoln has been called to that mansion which
God has reserved for the patriots who have served Him also, Stephen
Brice has thought of that steaming night in the low-ceiled room of the
country tavern, reeking with the smell of coarse food and hot humanity.He remembers vividly how at first his gorge rose, and recalls how
gradually there crept over him a forgetfulness of the squalidity and
discomfort.Then the
dawning of a worship for a very ugly man in a rumpled and ill-made coat.You will perceive that there was hope for Stephen.On his shake-down
that night, oblivious to the snores of his companions and the droning of
the insects, he lay awake.And before his eyes was that strange, marked
face, with its deep lines that blended both humor and sadness there.It
was homely, and yet Stephen found himself reflecting that honesty was
just as homely, and plain truth.And yet both were beautiful to those
who had learned to love them.He fell asleep wondering why Judge Whipple had sent him.It was in accord with nature that reaction came with the morning.Such a
morning, and such a place!He was awakened, shivering, by the beat of rain on the roof, and
stumbling over the prostrate forms of the four Beaver brothers, reached
the window.Clouds filled the sky, and Joshway, whose pallet was under
the sill, was in a blessed state of moisture.No wonder some of his enthusiasm had trickled away!He made his toilet in the wet under the pump outside; where he had to
wait his turn.And he rather wished he were going back to St.He had an early breakfast of fried eggs and underdone bacon, and coffee
which made him pine for Hester's.The dishes were neither too clean nor
too plentiful, being doused in water as soon as ever they were out of
use.But after breakfast the sun came out, and a crowd collected around the
tavern, although the air was chill and the muck deep in the street.Lincoln towering above the knots of
country politicians who surrounded him, and every once in a while a knot
would double up with laughter.There was no sign that the senatorial
aspirant took the situation seriously; that the coming struggle with
his skilful antagonist was weighing him down in the least.Stephen held
aloof from the groups, thinking that Mr.Louis on the morning train, and was even
pushing toward the tavern entrance with his bag in his hand, when he was
met by Mr."I had about given you up, Mr.Lincoln asked me to
get hold of you, and bring you to him alive or dead."Accordingly Stephen was led to the station, where a long train of twelve
cars was pulled up, covered with flags and bunting.On entering one of
these, he perceived Mr.Lincoln sprawled (he could think of no other
word to fit the attitude) on a seat next the window, and next him was
Mr.The seat just in front was reserved
for Mr.Hill, who was to make any notes necessary.His appearance was even less attractive than the night before, as he
had on a dirty gray linen duster."I thought you'd got loose, Steve," he said, holding out his hand.Just you sit down there next to Bob, where I can talk to
you."Stephen sat down, diffident, for he knew that there were others in that
train who would give ten years of their lives for that seat."I've taken a shine to this Bostonian, Joe," said Mr Lincoln to Mr."We've got to catch 'em young to do anything with 'em, you know.Now, Steve, just give me a notion how politics are over in St.What do they think of our new Republican party?Lincoln seemed to feel Medill's objections, as by mental telepathy.But
he said:-- "We'll come to that little matter later, Joe, when the cars
start."But under the influence of that
kindly eye he thawed, and forgot himself.He felt that this man was
not one to feign an interest.The shouts of the people on the little
platform interrupted the account, and the engine staggered off with its
load.Louis is a nest of Southern Democrats," Mr.Lincoln
remarked, "and not much opposition.""There are quite a few Old Line Whigs, sir," ventured Stephen, smiling.Lincoln, "did you ever hear Warfield's definition of an
Old Line Whig?""A man who takes his toddy regularly, and votes the Democratic ticket
occasionally, and who wears ruffled shirts."Both of these gentlemen laughed, and two more in the seat behind, who
had an ear to the conversation."But, sir," said Stephen, seeing that he was expected to go on, "I think
that the Republican party will gather a considerable strength there in
another year or two.We have the material for powerful leaders in Mr."We are getting an
ever increasing population from New England, mostly of young men who
will take kindly to the new party."And then he added, thinking of
his pilgrimage the Sunday before: "South St.Louis is a solid mass of
Germans, who are all antislavery.But they are very foreign still, and
have all their German institutions.""Then they will the more easily be turned into soldiers if the time
should come," said Mr.And he added quickly, "I pray that it
may not."Stephen had cause to remember that observation, and the acumen it
showed, long afterward.The train made several stops, and at each of them shoals of country
people filled the aisles, and paused for a most familiar chat with the
senatorial candidate.His appearance was the equal
in roughness to theirs, his manner if anything was more democratic,--yet
in spite of all this Stephen in them detected a deference which might
almost be termed a homage.Had our
friend been older, he might have known that the presence of good women
in a political crowd portends something.He
was destined to be still more surprised that day.When they had left behind them the shouts of the little down of Dixon,
Mr.Lincoln took off his hat, and produced a crumpled and not too
immaculate scrap of paper from the multitude therein."Now, Joe," said he, "here are the four questions I intend to ask Judge
Douglas."We don't care anything about the others," answered Mr.If you ask that second one, you'll never see the United
States Senate.""And the Republican party in this state will have had a blow from which
it can scarcely recover," added Mr.His eyes were far away over the
wet prairie.But neither he, nor Medill, nor Judd, nor Hill
guessed at the pregnancy of that moment.How were they to know that
the fate of the United States of America was concealed in that
Question,--was to be decided on a rough wooden platform that day in the
town of Freeport, Illinois?But Abraham Lincoln, the uncouth man in the linen duster with the
tousled hair, knew it.And the stone that was rejected of the builders
was to become the corner-stone of the temple.Lincoln recalled himself, glanced at the paper, and cleared
his throat.In measured tones, plainly heard above the rush and roar of
the train, he read the Question:

   "Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?""Abe," said he, solemnly, "Douglas will answer yes, or equivocate, and
that is all the assurance these Northern Democrats want to put Steve
Douglas in the Senate.Medill, reflecting the sheer astonishment of the
others; "then why the devil are you wearing yourself out?And why are we
spending our time and money on you?"Lincoln laid his hand on Medill's sleeve."Joe," said he, "a rat in the larder is easier to catch than a rat
that has the run of the cellar.You know, where to set your trap in the
larder.I'll tell you why I'm in this campaign: to catch Douglas now,
and keep him out of the White House in 1860.To save this country of
ours, Joe.There was a silence, broken by two exclamations."But see here, Abe," said Mr.Medill, as soon as ever he got his breath,
"what have we got to show for it?"Nowhere, I reckon," he answered simply."You mean to say, as the candidate of the Republican party, you don't
care whether you get to the Senate?""Not if I can send Steve Douglas there with his wings broken," was the
calm reply."Suppose he does answer yes, that slavery can be excluded?"Lincoln, "then Douglas loses the vote of the great
slave-holders, the vote of the solid South, that he has been fostering
ever since he has had the itch to be President.Without the solid South
the Little Giant will never live in the White House.And unless I'm
mightily mistaken, Steve Douglas has had his aye as far ahead as 1860
for some time."There was a stout man standing in
the aisle, and he spat deftly out of the open window."You may wing Steve Douglas, Abe," said he, gloomily, "but the gun will
kick you over the bluff.""Don't worry about me, Ed," said Mr.In a wave of comprehension the significance of all this was revealed to
Stephen Brice, The grim humor, the sagacious statesmanship, and (best of
all)--the superb self sacrifice of it, struck him suddenly.I think it
was in that hour that he realized the full extent of the wisdom he was
near, which was like unto Solomon's.Shame surged in Stephen's face that he should have misjudged him.And in after years, when
he thought of this new vital force which became part of him that day,
it was in the terms of Emerson: "Pythagoras was misunderstood, and
Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and
Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.How many have conversed with Lincoln before and since, and knew him not!Lincoln's greatness were
needed,--he had chosen to speak to them in homely parables.The story of
Farmer Bell was plain as day.Jim Rickets, who had life all his own way,
was none other than Stephen A. Douglas, the easily successful.The ugly
galoot, who dared to raise his eyes only to the pear, was Mr.And the pear was the Senatorship, which the galoot had denied
himself to save Susan from being Mr.Stephen could understand likewise the vehemence of the Republican
leaders who crowded around their candidate and tried to get him to
retract that Question.He listened quietly, he answered with a patient
smile.Now and then he threw a story into the midst of this discussion
which made them laugh in spite of themselves.The hopelessness of the
case was quite plain to Mr.Hill, who smiled, and whispered in Stephen's
ear: "He has made up his mind.They will not budge him an inch, and they
know it."Lincoln took the scrap of paper, which was even more dirty
and finger-marked by this time, and handed it to Mr.The train
was slowing down for Freeport.In the distance, bands could be heard
playing, and along the track, line upon line of men and women were
cheering and waving.It was ten o'clock, raw and cold for that time of
the year, and the sun was trying to come out.Lincoln, "be sure you get that right in your notes.And,
Steve, you stick close to me, and you'll see the show.Why, boys," he
added, smiling, "there's the great man's private car, cannon and all."All that Stephen saw was a regular day-car on a sidetrack.A brass
cannon was on the tender hitched behind it.CHAPTER V. THE CRISIS

Stephen A. Douglas, called the Little Giant on account of his intellect,
was a type of man of which our race has had some notable examples,
although they are not characteristic.Capable of sacrifice to their
country, personal ambition is, nevertheless, the mainspring of their
actions.They must either be before the public, or else unhappy.This
trait gives them a large theatrical strain, and sometimes brands them as
adventurers.Their ability saves them from being demagogues.In the case of Douglas, he had deliberately renewed some years before
the agitation on the spread of slavery, by setting forth a doctrine of
extreme cleverness.This doctrine, like many others of its kind, seemed
at first sight to be the balm it pretended, instead of an irritant, as
it really was.It was calculated to deceive all except thinking men, and
to silence all save a merciless logician.And this merciless logician,
who was heaven-sent in time of need, was Abraham Lincoln.Douglas was a juggler, a political prestidigitateur.He did things
before the eyes of the Senate and the nation.His balm for the healing
of the nation's wounds was a patent medicine so cleverly concocted that
experts alone could show what was in it.So abstruse and twisted were
some of Mr.Douglas's doctrines that a genius alone might put them into
simple words, for the common people.The great panacea for the slavery trouble put forth by Mr.Douglas
at that time was briefly this: that the people of the new territories
should decide for themselves, subject to the Constitution, whether they
should have slavery or not, and also decide for themselves all other
questions under the Constitution.Douglas, there was
the famous Dred Scott decision, which had set the South wild with joy
the year before, and had cast a gloom over the North.The Chief Justice
of the United States had declared that under the Constitution slaves
were property,--and as such every American citizen owning slaves could
carry them about with him wherever he went.Therefore the territorial
legislatures might pass laws until they were dumb, and yet their
settlers might bring with them all the slaves they pleased.He was a gentleman, a strong man, and a
patriot.He was magnanimous, and to his immortal honor be it said that
he, in the end, won the greatest of all struggles.He put down that mightiest thing that was in him,--his ambition for
himself.And he set up, instead, his ambition for his country.He bore
no ill-will toward the man whose fate was so strangely linked to his,
and who finally came to that high seat of honor and of martyrdom which
he coveted.We shall love the Judge, and speak of him with reverence,
for that sublime act of kindness before the Capitol in 1861.Abraham Lincoln might have prayed on that day of the Freeport debate:

"Forgive him, Lord.Lincoln descried the
danger afar, and threw his body into the breach.That which passed before Stephen's eyes, and to which his ears listened
at Freeport, was the Great Republic pressing westward to the Pacific.He
wondered whether some of his Eastern friends who pursed their lips when
the Wrest was mentioned would have sneered or prayed.A young English
nobleman who was there that day did not sneer.He was filled instead
with something like awe at the vigor of this nation which was sprung
from the loins of his own.Crudeness he saw, vulgarity he heard, but
Force he felt, and marvelled.America was in Freeport that day, the rush of her people and the
surprise of her climate.The rain had ceased, and quickly was come out
of the northwest a boisterous wind, chilled by the lakes and scented by
the hemlocks of the Minnesota forests.The sun smiled and frowned Clouds
hurried in the sky, mocking the human hubbub below.Cheering thousands
pressed about the station as Mr.They hemmed
him in his triumphal passage under the great arching trees to the new
Brewster House.The Chief Marshal and his aides, great men before,
were suddenly immortal.The county delegations fell into their proper
precedence like ministers at a state dinner."We have faith in Abraham,
Yet another County for the Rail-sputter, Abe the Giant-killer,"--so the
banners read.Here, much bedecked, was the Galena Lincoln Club, part of
Joe Davies's shipment.Fifes skirled, and drums throbbed, and the stars
and stripes snapped in the breeze.And here was a delegation headed
by fifty sturdy ladies on horseback, at whom Stephen gaped like a
countryman.Then came carryalls of all ages and degrees, wagons from
this county and that county, giddily draped, drawn by horses from one
to six, or by mules, their inscriptions addressing their senatorial
candidate in all degrees of familiarity, but not contempt.What they
seemed proudest of was that he had been a rail-splitter, for nearly all
bore a fence-rail.But stay, what is this wagon with the high sapling flagstaff in the
middle, and the leaves still on it?"Westward the Star of Empire takes its way.The girls link on to Lincoln; their mothers were for Clay."Here was glory to blind you,--two and thirty maids in red sashes and
blue liberty caps with white stars.Each was a state of the Union,
and every one of them was for Abraham, who called them his "Basket of
Flowers."Behind them, most touching of all, sat a thirty-third shackled
in chains.Alas, the men of Kansas was far from being
as sorrowful as the part demanded,--in spite of her instructions she
would smile at the boys.But the appealing inscription she bore, "Set me
free" was greeted with storms of laughter, the boldest of the young men
shouting that she was too beautiful to be free, and some of the old
men, to their shame be it said likewise shouted.But the young men who had
brought their sweethearts to town, and were standing hand in hand with
them, for obvious reasons saw nothing: They scarcely dared to look at
Kansas, and those who did were so loudly rebuked that they turned down
the side streets.During this part of the day these loving couples, whose devotion was so
patent to the whole world, were by far the most absorbing to Stephen.He watched them having their fortunes told, the young women blushing and
crying, "Say!"and the young men getting their
ears boxed for certain remarks.He watched them standing open-mouthed
at the booths and side shows with hands still locked, or again they were
chewing cream candy in unison.Or he glanced sidewise at them, seated in
the open places with the world so far below them that even the insistent
sound of the fifes and drums rose but faintly to their ears.And perhaps,--we shall not say positively,--perhaps Mr.Brice's thoughts
went something like this, "O that love were so simple a matter to all!"But graven on his face was what is called the "Boston scorn."And no
scorn has been known like unto it since the days of Athens.So Stephen made the best of his way to the Brewster House, the elegance
and newness of which the citizens of Freeport openly boasted.Lincoln had preceded him, and was even then listening to a few remarks
of burning praise by an honorable gentleman.Lincoln himself made a
few remarks, which seemed so simple and rang so true, and were so free
from political rococo and decoration generally, that even the young
men forgot their sweethearts to listen.Lincoln went into the
hotel, and the sun slipped under a black cloud.The lobby was full, and rather dirty, since the supply of spittoons was
so far behind the demand.Like the firmament, it was divided into little
bodies which revolved about larger bodies.But there lacked not here
supporters of the Little Giant, and discreet farmers of influence in
their own counties who waited to hear the afternoon's debate before
deciding.These and others did not hesitate to tell of the magnificence
of the Little Giant's torchlight procession the previous evening.Every
Dred-Scottite had carried a torch, and many transparencies, so that
the very glory of it had turned night into day.The Chief Lictor had
distributed these torches with an unheard-of liberality.But there
lacked not detractors who swore that John Dibble and other Lincolnites
had applied for torches for the mere pleasure of carrying them.Since
dawn the delegations had been heralded from the house-tops, and wagered
on while they were yet as worms far out or the prairie.All the morning
these continued to came in, and form in line to march past their
particular candidate.The second great event of the day was the event
of the special over the Galena roar, of sixteen cars and more than a
thousand pairs of sovereign lungs.With military precision they repaired
to the Brewster House, and ahead of then a banner was flung: "Winnebago
County for the Tall Sucker."And the Tall Sucker was on the steps to
receive them.Douglas, who had arrived the evening before to the booming
of two and thirty guns, had his banners end his bunting, too.The
neighborhood of Freeport was stronghold of Northern Democrats, ardent
supporters of the Little Giant if once they could believe that he did
not intend to betray them.Stephen felt in his bones the coming of a struggle, and was
thrilled.Once he smiled at the thought that he had become an active
partisan--nay, a worshipper--of the uncouth Lincoln.Terrible suspicion
for a Bostonian,--had he been carried away?Was his hero, after all, a
homespun demagogue?Had he been wise in deciding before he had taught
a glimpse of the accomplished Douglas, whose name end fame filled the
land?But in his heart there
lurked a fear of the sophisticated Judge and Senator and man of the
world whom he had not yet seen.In his notebook he had made a copy of
the Question, and young Mr.Hill discovered him pondering in a corner
of the lobby at dinnertime.After dinner they went together to their
candidate's room.They found the doors open and the place packed, and
there was Mr.Lincoln's very tall hat towering above those of the
other politicians pressed around him.Lincoln took three strides in
Stephen's direction and seized him by the shoulder."Why, Steve," said he, "I thought you had got away again."Turning to a
big burly man with a good-natures face, who was standing by, he added."Jim, I want you to look out for this young man.Get him a seat on the
stands where he can hear."He never knew what the gentleman's last name
was, or whether he had any.It was but a few minutes' walk to the grove
where the speaking was to be.And as they made their way thither Mr.Lincoln passed them in a Conestoga wagon drawn by six milk-white horses.Jim informed Stephen that the Little Giant had had a six-horse coach.Hovering about the hem of the crowd
were the sunburned young men in their Sunday best, still clinging fast
to the hands of the young women.Bands blared "Columbia, Gem of the
Ocean."Fakirs planted their stands in the way, selling pain-killers
and ague cures, watermelons and lemonade, Jugglers juggled, and beggars
begged.Jim said that there were sixteen thousand people in that grove.He tried to think of himself as
fifty years old, with the courage to address sixteen thousand people on
such a day, and quailed.What a man of affairs it must take to do
that!Sixteen thousand people, into each of whose breasts God had put
different emotions and convictions.He had never even imagined such a
crowd as this assembles merely to listen to a political debate.But then
he remembered, as they dodged from in front of the horses, what it was
not merely a political debate: The pulse of nation was here, a great
nation stricken with approaching fever.It was not now a case of excise,
but of existence.This son of toil who had driven his family thirty miles across the
prairie, blanketed his tired horses and slept on the ground the night
before, who was willing to stand all through the afternoon and listen
with pathetic eagerness to this debate, must be moved by a patriotism
divine.In the breast of that farmer, in the breast of his tired wife
who held her child by the hand, had been instilled from birth that
sublime fervor which is part of their life who inherit the Declaration
of Independence.Instinctively these men who had fought and won the West
had scented the danger.With the spirit of their ancestors who had left
their farms to die on the bridge at Concord, or follow Ethan Allen into
Ticonderoga, these had come to Freeport.What were three days of bodily
discomfort!What even the loss of part of a cherished crop, if the
nation's existence were at stake and their votes might save it!In the midst of that heaving human sea rose the bulwarks of a wooden
stand.The rough
farmers commonly squeezed a way for him.And when they did not, he made
it with his big body.As they drew near their haven, a great surging as
of a tidal wave swept them off their feet.There was a deafening shout,
and the stand rocked on its foundations.Before Stephen could collect
his wits, a fierce battle was raging about him.Abolitionist and
Democrat, Free Soiler and Squatter Sov, defaced one another in a rush
for the platform.The committeemen and reporters on top of it rose to
its defence.Jim was
recognized and hauled bodily into the fort, and Stephen after him.The
populace were driven off, and when the excitement died down again, he
found himself in the row behind the reporters.Hill paused
while sharpening his pencil to wave him a friendly greeting.Stephen, craning in his seat, caught sight of Mr.Lincoln slouched into
one of his favorite attitudes, his chin resting in his hand.But who is this, erect, compact, aggressive, searching with a confident
eye the wilderness of upturned faces?A personage, truly, to be
questioned timidly, to be approached advisedly.Here indeed was a lion,
by the very look of him, master of himself and of others.By reason of
its regularity and masculine strength, a handsome face.A man of the
world to the cut of the coat across the broad shoulders.Here was one
to lift a youngster into the realm of emulation, like a character in a
play, to arouse dreams of Washington and its senators and great men.For
this was one to be consulted by the great alone.A figure of dignity and
power, with magnetism to compel moods.Since, when he smiled, you warmed
in spite of yourself, and when he frowned the world looked grave.The inevitable comparison was come, and Stephen's hero was shrunk once
more.He drew a deep breath, searched for the word, and gulped.How country Abraham Lincoln looked beside Stephen
Arnold Douglas!Had the Lord ever before made and set over against each other two such
different men?Yes, for such are the ways of the Lord.........................

The preliminary speaking was in progress, but Stephen neither heard nor
saw until he felt the heavy hand of his companion on his knee."There's something mighty strange, like fate, between them two," he was
saying."I recklect twenty-five years ago when they was first in the
Legislatur' together.A man told me that they was both admitted to
practice in the S'preme Court in '39, on the same day, sir.Then you
know they was nip an' tuck after the same young lady.They've been in Congress together, the Little Giant in the Senate, and
now, here they be in the greatest set of debates the people of this
state ever heard; Young man, the hand of fate is in this here, mark my
words--"

There was a hush, and the waves of that vast human sea were stilled.A
man, lean, angular, with coat-tail: flapping-unfolded like a grotesque
figure at a side-show.Stooping forward, Abraham Lincoln began to
speak, and Stephen Brice hung his head and shuddered.Could this shrill
falsetto be the same voice to which he had listened only that morning?Could this awkward, yellow man with his hands behind his back be he whom
he had worshipped?Ripples of derisive laughter rose here and there, on
the stand and from the crowd.Thrice distilled was the agony of those
moments!But what was this feeling that gradually crept over him?The hands were coming around to the
front.Suddenly one of them was thrown sharply back, with a determined
gesture, the head was raised,--and--and his shame was for gotten.But soon he lost even that, for his mind was
gone on a journey.And when again he came to himself and looked upon
Abraham Lincoln, this was a man transformed.Nay, it was now a powerful instrument which played strangely on
those who heard.Now it rose, and again it fell into tones so low as to
start a stir which spread and spread, like a ripple in a pond, until it
broke on the very edge of that vast audience."Can the people of a United States Territory, in any lawful way,
   against the wish of any citizen of the United States, exclude
   slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State
   Constitution?"It was out, at last, irrevocably writ in the recording book of History,
for better, for worse.Beyond the reach of politician, committee, or
caucus.But what man amongst those who heard and stirred might say that
these minutes even now basting into eternity held the Crisis of a nation
that is the hope of the world?Not you, Judge Douglas who sit there
smiling.Consternation is a stranger in your heart,--but answer the
question if you can.Yes, your nimble wit has helped you out of many a
tight corner.You do not feel the noose--as yet.You do not guess that
your reply will make or mar the fortunes of your country.It is not
you who can look ahead two short years and see the ship of Democracy
splitting on the rocks at Charleston and at Baltimore, when the power of
your name might have steered her safely.One by one he is
taking the screws out of the engine which you have invented to run your
ship.Look, he holds them in his hands without mixing them, and shows
the false construction of its secret parts.For Abraham Lincoln dealt with abstruse questions in language so limpid
that many a farmer, dulled by toil, heard and understood and marvelled.The simplicity of the Bible dwells in those speeches, and they are now
classics in our literature.And the wonder in Stephen's mind was that
this man who could be a buffoon, whose speech was coarse and whose
person unkempt, could prove himself a tower of morality and truth.That
has troubled many another, before and since the debate at Freeport.That short hour came all too quickly to an end.And as the Moderator
gave the signal for Mr.Lincoln, it was Stephen's big companion who
snapped the strain, and voiced the sentiment of those about him.I didn't think Abe had it in
him."The Honorable Stephen A. Douglas, however, seemed anything but baffled
as he rose to reply.As he waited for the cheers which greeted him to
die out, his attitude was easy and indifferent, as a public man's should
be.The question seemed not to trouble him in the least.But for Stephen
Brice the Judge stood there stripped of the glamour that made him, even
as Abraham Lincoln had stripped his doctrine of its paint and colors,
and left it punily naked.Standing up, the very person of the Little Giant was contradictory, as
was the man himself.But he had the head
and shoulders of a lion, and even the lion's roar.What at contrast the
ring of his deep bass to the tentative falsetto of Mr.If Stephen expected the Judge to tremble, he was greatly
disappointed.As if to show the people
how lightly he held his opponent's warnings, he made them gape by
putting things down Mr.Lincoln's shirt-front and taking them out of his
mouth: But it appeared to Stephen, listening with all his might, that
the Judge was a trifle more on the defensive than his attitude might
lead one to expect.Was he not among his own Northern Democrats at
Freeport?And yet it seemed to give him a keen pleasure to call his
hearers "Black Republicans.""Not black," came from the crowd again
and again, and once a man: shouted, "Couldn't you modify it and call
it brown?"cried the Judge, and dubbed them "Yankees,"
although himself a Vermonter by birth.He implied that most of these
Black Republicans desired <DW64> wives.But quick,--to the Question, How was the Little Giant, artful in debate
as he was, to get over that without offence to the great South?Very
skillfully the judge disposed of the first of the interrogations.And
then, save for the gusts of wind rustling the trees, the grove might
have been empty of its thousands, such was the silence that fell.But
tighter and tighter they pressed against the stand, until it trembled.Oh, Judge, the time of all artful men will come at length.How were you
to foresee a certain day under the White Dome of the Capitol?Had your
sight been long, you would have paused before your answer.Had your
sight been long, you would have seen this ugly Lincoln bareheaded before
the Nation, and you are holding his hat.Judge Douglas, this act alone
has redeemed your faults.It has given you a nobility of which we did
not suspect you.At the end God gave you strength to be humble, and so
you left the name of a patriot.Judge, you thought there was a passage between Scylla and Charybdis
which your craftiness might overcome."It matters not," you cried when you answered the Question, "it matters
not which way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract
question whether slavery may or may not go into a territory under
the Constitution.The people have the lawful means to introduce or to
exclude it as they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist
a day or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police
regulations."Judge Douglas, uneasy will you lie to-night, for you have uttered the
Freeport Heresy.It only remains to be told how Stephen Brice, coming to the Brewster
House after the debate, found Mr.On his knee, in transports
of delight, was a small boy, and Mr.Lincoln was serenely playing on
the child's Jew's-harp.Standing beside him was a proud father who had
dragged his son across two counties in a farm wagon, and who was to
return on the morrow to enter this event in the family Bible.In a
corner of the room were several impatient gentlemen of influence who
wished to talk about the Question.Lincoln looked up with a smile of welcome
that is still, and ever will be, remembered and cherished."Tell Judge Whipple that I have attended to that little matter, Steve,"
he said.Lincoln," he exclaimed, "you have had no time."Lincoln replied, "and I think that I am
well repaid.Steve," said he, "unless I'm mightily mistaken, you know a
little more than you did yesterday."Didn't you feel sorry for
me last night?""I never shall again, sir," he said.The wonderful smile, so ready to come and go, flickered and went out.In
its stead on the strange face was ineffable sadness,--the sadness of the
world's tragedies, of Stephen stoned, of Christ crucified."Pray God that you may feel sorry for me again," he said.Awed, the child on his lap was still.Lincoln had kept Stephen's hand in his own."I have hopes of you, Stephen," he said.Why was it that he walked to the station with a
heavy heart?It was a sense of the man he had left, who had been and was
to be.This Lincoln of the black loam, who built his neighbor's cabin
and hoed his neighbor's corn, who had been storekeeper and postmaster
and flat-boatman.Who had followed a rough judge dealing a rough justice
around a rough circuit; who had rolled a local bully in the dirt;
rescued women from insult; tended the bedside of many a sick coward who
feared the Judgment; told coarse stories on barrels by candlelight (but
these are pure beside the vice of great cities); who addressed political
mobs in the raw, swooping down from the stump and flinging embroilers
east and west.This physician who was one day to tend the sickbed of the
Nation in her agony; whose large hand was to be on her feeble pulse, and
whose knowledge almost divine was to perform the miracle of her healing.So was it that, the Physician Himself performed His cures, and when work
was done, died a martyr.Abraham Lincoln died in His name




CHAPTER VI.GLENCOE

It was nearly noon when Stephen walked into the office the next day,
dusty and travel-worn and perspiring.He had come straight from the
ferry, without going home.And he had visions of a quiet dinner with
Richter under the trees at the beer-garden, where he could talk about
Abraham Lincoln.But the young German met him at the top of the stair--and his face was
more serious than usual, although he showed his magnificent teeth in a
smile of welcome."You are a little behind your time, my friend," said he, "What has
happened you?""Ah, I know not," he answered, "He has gone is Glencoe.Doctor Polk says that he has worked all his life too hard.The Doctor and Colonel Carvel tried to get him to go to Glencoe.But
he would not budge until Miss Carvel herself comes all the way from the
country yesterday, and orders him.exclaimed Richter, impulsively,
"what wonderful women you have in America!I could lose my head when I
think of Miss Carvel.""Miss Carvel was here, you say?"said Richter, disgusted, "you don't care."And becoming grave again, added: "Except on
Judge Whipple's account.Have you heard from him to-day, Carl?""This morning one of Colonel Carvel's servants came for his letters.I--I pray that he is better," said Richter, his
voice breaking.But he had been conscious all at once of an
affection for the Judge of which he had not suspected himself.That
afternoon, on his way home, he stopped at Carvel & Company's to inquire.Hopper said, and added that he "presumed
likely the Colonel would not be in for a week."Eliphalet was actually in the Colonel's sanctum behind the partition,
giving orders to several clerks at the time.He was so prosperous and
important that he could scarce spare a moment to answer Stephen, who
went away wondering whether he had been wise to choose the law.On Monday, when Stephen called at Carvel & Company's, Eliphalet was too
busy to see him.But Ephum, who went out to Glencoe every night with
orders, told him that the "Jedge was wuss, suh."On Wednesday, there
being little change, Mrs.Brice ventured to despatch a jelly by Ephum.On Friday afternoon, when Stephen was deep in Whittlesey and the New
Code, he became aware of Ephum standing beside him.In reply to his
anxious question Ephum answered:

"I reckon he better, suh.He an' de Colonel done commence wrastlin'
'bout a man name o' Linkum.De Colonel done wrote you dis note, suh."It was a very polite note, containing the Colonel's compliments, asking
Mr.Brice to Glencoe that afternoon with whatever papers or letters the
Judge might wish to see.And since there was no convenient train in the
evening, Colonel Carvel would feel honored if Mr.The Missouri side of the Mississippi is a very different country from
the hot and treeless prairies of Illinois.As Stephen alighted at the
little station at Glencoe and was driven away by Ned in the Colonel's
buggy, he drew in deep breaths of the sweet air of the Meramec Valley.There had been a shower, and the sun glistened on the drops on grass and
flowers, and the great trees hung heavy over the clay road.At last they
came to a white gate in the picket fence, in sight of a rambling wooden
house with a veranda in front covered with honeysuckle.And then he saw
the Colonel, in white marseilles, smoking a cigar.As Stephen trod the rough flags between the high grass which led toward
the house, Colonel Carvel rose to his full height and greeted him."You are very welcome, sir," he said gravely."The Judge is asleep now,"
he added."I regret to say that we had a little argument this morning,
and my daughter tells me it will be well not to excite him again to-day.Jinny is reading to him now, or she would be here to entertain you, Mr.Jackson appeared hurriedly, seized Stephen's bag, and led the way
upstairs through the cool and darkened house to a pretty little room on
the south side, with matting, and roses on the simple dressing-table.After he had sat awhile staring at these, and at the wet flower-garden
from between the slats of his shutters, he removed the signs of the
railroad upon him, and descended.The Colonel was still on the porch, in
his easy-chair.He had lighted another, cigar, and on the stand beside
him stood two tall glasses, green with the fresh mint.Colonel Carvel
rose, and with his own hand offered one to Stephen.Brice," he said, "and I hope you will feel at home
here, sir.Jackson will bring you anything you desire, and should you
wish to drive, I shall be delighted to show you the country."Stephen drank that julep with reverence, and then the Colonel gave him
a cigar.He was quite overcome by this treatment of a penniless young
Yankee.The Colonel did not talk politics--such was not his notion of
hospitality to a stranger.He talked horse, and no great discernment on
Stephen's part was needed to perceive that this was Mr."I used to have a stable, Mr.Brice, before they ruined gentleman's
sport with these trotters ten years ago.Yes sir, we used to be at
Lexington one week, and Louisville the next, and over here on the Ames
track after that.Did you ever hear of Water Witch and Netty Boone?""Why, sir," he cried, "that very <DW65>, Ned, who drove you here from
the cars-he used to ride Netty Boone.He was the best jockey ever strode a horse on the Elleardsville track
here.He wore my yellow and green, sir, until he got to weigh one
hundred and a quarter.And I kept him down to that weight a whole year,
Mr.I had him wrapped in blankets and set in a chair with
holes bored in the seat.Then we lighted a spirit lamp under him.Many
a time I took off ten pounds that way.It needs fire to get flesh off a
<DW65>, sir."He didn't notice his guest's amazement."Then, sir," he continued, "they introduced these damned trotting races;
trotting races are for white trash, Mr.I wish you
could have seen Miss Virginia Carvel as he saw her then.A tea-tray was in her hand, and her head was tilted
back, as women are apt to do when they carry a burden.It was so that
these Southern families, who were so bitter against Abolitionists and
Yankees, entertained them when they were poor, and nursed them when they
were ill.Stephen, for his life, could not utter a word.But Virginia turned to
him with perfect self-possession."He has been boring you with his horses, Mr."Has he
told you what a jockey Ned used to be before he weighed one hundred and
a quarter?""Has he given you the points of Water Witch and
Netty Boone?""Pa, I tell you once more that you will drive every guest from this
house.O that you might have a notion of the way in which Virginia pronounced
intolerable.Carvel reached for another cigar asked, "My dear," he asked, "how is
the Judge?""My dear," said Virginia, smiling, "he is asleep.Mammy Easter is with
him, trying to make out what he is saying.He talks in his sleep, just
as you do--"

"And what is he saying?""'A house divided against itself,'" said Miss Carvel, with a sweep of
her arm, "'cannot stand.I believe that this Government cannot endure
permanently, half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to
dissolve--I do not expect the house to fall--but I do expect it will
cease to be divided.'"No," cried the Colonel, and banged his fist down on the table."Why,"
said he, thoughtfully, stroking the white goatee on his chin, "cuss me
if that ain't from the speech that country bumpkin, Lincoln, made in
June last before the Black Republican convention in Illinois."And Stephen was very near it, for
he loved the Colonel.That gentleman suddenly checked himself in his
tirade, and turned to him."I beg your pardon, sir," he said; "I reckon that you have the same
political sentiments as the Judge.Believe me, sir, I would not
willingly offend a guest.""I am not offended, sir," he said.Carvel to bestow a quick glance upon him."You will pardon my absence for a while, sir," he said.In silence they watched him as he strode off under the trees through
tall grass, a yellow setter at his heels.The shadows of the walnuts and hickories were growing long, and
a rich country was giving up its scent to the evening air.From a cabin
behind the house was wafted the melody of a plantation song.To
the young man, after the burnt city, this was paradise.And then he
remembered his mother as she must be sitting on the tiny porch in
town, and sighed.Only two years ago she had been at their own place at
Westbury.He looked up, and saw the girl watching him.He dared not think that the
expression he caught was one of sympathy, for it changed instantly."I am afraid you are the silent kind, Mr.Brice," said she; "I believe
it is a Yankee trait.""I have known a great many who were not," said he, "When they are
garrulous, they are very much so.""I should prefer a garrulous one," said Virginia."I should think a Yankee were bad enough, but a noisy Yankee not to be
put up with," he ventured.Virginia did not deign a direct reply to this, save by the corners of
her mouth."I wonder," said she, thoughtfully, "whether it is strength of mind or a
lack of ideas that makes them silent.""It is mostly prudence," said Mr."Prudence is our dominant
trait.""You have not always shown it," she said, with an innocence which in
women is often charged with meaning.He would have liked
greatly to know whether she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or
to his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before."We have something left to be thankful for," he answered."We are still
capable of action.""On occasions it is violence," said Virginia, desperately.This man must
not get ahead of her."It is just as violent," said he, "as the repressed feeling which
prompts it."This was a new kind of conversation to Virginia.Of all the young men
she knew, not one had ever ventured into anything of the sort.They were
either flippant, or sentimental, or both.She was at once flattered
and annoyed, flattered, because, as a woman, Stephen had conceded her
a mind.Many of the young men she knew had minds, but deemed that these
were wasted on women, whose language was generally supposed to be a kind
of childish twaddle.Even Jack Brinsmade rarely risked his dignity
and reputation at an intellectual tilt.This was one of Virginia's
grievances.She often argued with her father, and, if the truth were
told, had had more than one victory over Judge Whipple.Virginia's annoyance came from the fact that she perceived in Stephen
a natural and merciless logic,--a faculty for getting at the bottom
of things.His brain did not seem to be thrown out of gear by local
magnetic influences,--by beauty, for instance.He did not lose his head,
as did some others she knew, at the approach of feminine charms.Here
was a grand subject, then, to try the mettle of any woman.One with
less mettle would have given it up.But Virginia thought it would be
delightful to bring this particular Yankee to his knees; and--and leave
him there.Brice," she said, "I have not spoken to you since the night of my
party."Yes, we did," said he, "and I called, but was unfortunate."Now Miss Carvel was complacency itself."Jackson is so careless with cards," said she, "and very often I do not
take the trouble to read them.""I am sorry," said he, "as I wished for the opportunity to tell you how
much I enjoyed myself.She remembered how, she had opposed his
coning.But honesty as well as something else prompted her to say: "It
was my father who invited you."Stephen did not reveal the shock his vanity had received."At least you were good enough to dance with me.""I could scarcely refuse a guest," she replied."Had I thought it would have given you annoyance," he said quietly, "I
should not have asked you.""Which would have been a lack of good manners," said Virginia, biting
her lips.Stephen answered nothing, but wished himself in St.He could not
comprehend her cruelty.But, just then, the bell rang for supper, and
the Colonel appeared around the end of the house.It was one of those suppers for which the South is renowned.And when
at length he could induce Stephen to eat no more, Colonel Carvel reached
for his broad-brimmed felt hat, and sat smoking, with his feet against
the mantle.Virginia, who had talked but little, disappeared with a tray
on which she had placed with her own hands some dainties to tempt the
Judge.The Colonel regaled Stephen, when she was gone, with the pedigree and
performance of every horse he had had in his stable.And this was a
relief, as it gave him an opportunity to think without interruption upon
Virginia's pronounced attitude of dislike.To him it was inconceivable
that a young woman of such qualities as she appeared to have, should
assail him so persistently for freeing a negress, and so depriving her
of a maid she had set her heart upon.There were other New England young
men in society.They were not
her particular friends, to be sure.But they called on her and danced
with her, and she had shown them not the least antipathy.But it was to
Stephen's credit that he did not analyze her further.He was reflecting on these things when he got to his room, when there
came a knock at the door.It was Mammy Easter, in bright turban and
apron,--was hospitality and comfort in the flesh."Is you got all you need, suh?"But Mammy showed no inclination to go, and
he was too polite to shut the door:

"How you like Glencoe, Mistah Bride?""We has some of de fust fam'lies out heah in de summer," said she."But
de Colonel, he a'n't much on a gran' place laik in Kaintuck.Shucks, no,
suh, dis ain't much of a'stablishment!Young Massa won't have no lawns,
no greenhouses, no nothin'.He say he laik it wil' and simple.He on'y
come out fo' two months, mebbe.But Miss Jinny, she make it lively.Las'
week, until the Jedge come we hab dis house chuck full, two-three young
ladies in a room, an' five young gemmen on trunnle beds."Den Miss Jinny low dey all hatter go.She say she a'n't
gwineter have 'em noun''sturbin' a sick man.He
done give the Judge his big room, and he say he and de young men gwine
ober to Mista, Catherwood's.You a'n't never seen Miss Jinny rise up,
suh!She des swep' 'em all out" (Mammy emphasized this by rolling her
hands) "an' declah she gwine ten' to the Jedge herself.She a'n't never
let me bring up one of his meals, suh."And so she left Stephen with
some food for reflection.Virginia was very gay at breakfast, and said that the Judge would see
Stephen; so he and the Colonel, that gentleman with his hat on, went
up to his room.The shutters were thrown open, and the morning sunlight
filtered through the leaves and fell on the four-poster where the Judge
sat up, gaunt and grizzled as ever.He smiled at his host, and then
tried to destroy immediately the effect of the smile."Well, Judge," cried the Colonel, taking his hand, "I reckon we talked
too much.""No such thing, Carvel," said the Judge, forcibly, "if you hadn't
left the room, your popular sovereignty would have been in rags in two
minutes."Stephen sat down in a corner, unobserved, in expectation of a renewal.But at this moment Miss Virginia swept into the room, very cool in a
pink muslin."Colonel Carvel," said she, sternly, "I am the doctor's deputy here.I
was told to keep the peace at any cost.And if you answer back, out you
go, like that!"But the Judge, whose mind was on the argument,
continued to mutter defiantly until his eye fell upon Stephen."Well, sir, well, sir," he said, "you've turned up at last, have you?I send you off with papers for a man, and I get back a piece of yellow
paper saying that he's borrowed you."He took me to Freeport, sir, where I listened to the most remarkable
speech I ever expect to hear."cried the Judge, "so far from Boston?"Stephen hesitated, uncertain whether to laugh, until he chanced to look
at Virginia."I was very much surprised, sir," he said.Whipple, "and what did you chink of that ruffian,
Lincoln?""He is the most remarkable man that I have ever met, sir," answered
Stephen, with emphasis.It seemed as if the grunt this time had in it something of approval.Stephen had doubt as to the propriety of discussing Mr.Lincoln there,
and he reddened.Virginia's expression bore a trace of defiance, and Mr.Carvel stood with his feet apart, thoughtfully stroking his goatee.Whipple seemed to have no scruples."You must agree with
that laudatory estimation of him which I read in the Missouri Democrat.""I do, sir, most decidedly," he answered."I should hardly expect a conservative Bostonian, of the class which
respects property, to have said that.It might possibly be a good thing
if more from your town could hear those debates.""They will read them, sir; I feel confident of it."At this point the Colonel could contain himself no longer."I reckon I might tell the man who wrote that Democrat article a few
things, if I could find out who he is," said he.But Stephen had turned a fiery red, "I wrote it, Colonel Carvel," he
said.For a dubious instant of silence Colonel Carvel stared.Then--then he
slapped his knees, broke into a storm of laughter, and went out of the
room.He left Stephen in a moist state of discomfiture.The Judge had bolted upright from the pillows."You have been neglecting your law, sir," he cried."I wrote the article at night," said Stephen, indignantly."Then it must have been Sunday night, Mr.At this point Virginia hid her face in her handkerchief which trembled
visibly.Being a woman, whose ways are unaccountable, the older man took
no notice of her.But being a young woman, and a pretty one, Stephen was
angry."I don't see what right you have to ask me that sir," he said.Brice," said the Judge, "Virginia, you
may strike it from the records.And now, sir, tell me something about
your trip."An hour later Stephen descended to the veranda, and it was with
apprehension that he discerned Mr.Carvel seated under the vines at the
far end.To Stephen's surprise the Colonel rose, and, coming toward him, laid a
kindly hand on his shoulder."Stephen," said he, "there will be no law until Monday you must stay
with us until then.I shall have to go by the two o'clock train, I
fear."The Colonel turned to Virginia, who, meanwhile, had sat silently by."Jinny," he said, "we must contrive to keep him.""I'm afraid he is determined, Pa," she answered.Brice
would like to see a little of the place before he goes.It is very
primitive," she explained, "not much like yours in the East."Stephen thanked her, and bowed to the Colonel.And so she led him past
the low, crooked outbuildings at the back, where he saw old Uncle
Ben busy over the preparation of his dinner, and frisky Rosetta, his
daughter, playing with one of the Colonel's setters.Then Virginia took
a well-worn path, on each side of which the high grass bent with its
load of seed, which entered the wood.Oaks and hickories and walnuts
and persimmons spread out in a glade, and the wild grape twisted
fantastically around the trunks.All this beauty seemed but a fit
setting to the strong girlish figure in the pink frock before him.So absorbed was he in contemplation of this, and in wondering whether
indeed she were to marry her cousin, Clarence Colfax, that he did not
see the wonders of view unrolling in front of him.She stopped at length
beside a great patch of wild race bushes.They were on the edge of the
bluff, and in front of them a little rustic summer-house, with seats on
its five sides.But Stephen, going to the edge,
stood and marvelled.Far, far below him, down the wooded steep, shot
the crystal Meramec, chafing over the shallow gravel beds and tearing
headlong at the deep passes.Beyond, the dimpled green hills rose and fell, and the stream ran indigo
and silver.A hawk soared over the water, the only living creature in
all that wilderness.And when at length he turned,
he saw that the girl was watching him.Virginia had taken other young men here, and they had looked only upon
her.This sincerity now was as new to her
as that with which he had surprised her in the Judge's room.A reply to those simple words of his
was impossible.At honest Tom Catherwood in the same situation she would
have laughed, Clarence never so much as glanced at scenery.Her replies
to him were either flippant, or else maternal, as to a child.A breeze laden with the sweet abundance of that valley stirred her hair.And with that womanly gesture which has been the same through the ages
she put up her hand; deftly tucking in the stray wisp behind.She glanced at the New Englander, against whom she had been in strange
rebellion since she had first seen him.His face, thinned by the summer
in town, was of the sternness of the Puritan.Stephen's features were
sharply marked for his age.Yet justice
was in the mouth, and greatness of heart.Conscience was graven on the
broad forehead.The eyes were the blue gray of the flint, kindly yet
imperishable.Struggling, then yielding to the impulse, Virginia let herself be led on
into the years.Sanity was the word that best described him.She saw him
trusted of men, honored of women, feared by the false.She saw him in
high places, simple, reserved, poised evenly as he was now."I wish that I might stay," he said regretfully."But I cannot, Miss
Carvel."Never before had she
stooped to urge young men to stay.The difficulty had always been to get
them to go.It was natural, perhaps, that her vanity was wounded.But it
hurt her to think that she had made the overture, had tried to conquer
whatever it was that set her against him, and had failed through him.Perhaps," she added, with a little
laugh, "perhaps it is Bellefontaine Road.""Then" (with a touch of derision), "then it is because you cannot miss
an afternoon's work."I was not always that kind," he answered.But now I have to or--or starve," he said.For the second time his complete simplicity had disarmed her.He had not
appealed to her sympathy, nor had he hinted at the luxury in which he
was brought up.She would have liked to question Stephen on this former
life."I thought him the ugliest man I ever saw, and the handsomest as well.""You believe with him that this government cannot exist half slave and
half free.Brice, when you and I shall be
foreigners one to the other.""You have forgotten," he said eagerly, "you have forgotten the rest
of the quotation.'I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not
expect the house to fall--but cease to be divided.'It will become all
one thing or all the other.""That seemed to me very equivocal," said she."Your
rail-sputter is well named.""Will you read the rest of that speech?"he asked

"Judge Whipple is very clever.He has made a convert of you," she
answered."The Judge has had nothing to do with it," cried Stephen."He is not
given to discussion with me, and until I went to Springfield had never
mentioned Lincoln's name to me."Glancing at her, he surprised a sparkle of amusement in her eyes."Why do you suppose that you were sent to Springfield?""And that most important communication was--your self.There, now, I
have told you," said Virginia."Then you haven't the sense I thought you had," she replied impatiently."Do you know what was in that note?Well, a year ago last June this
Black Republican lawyer whom you are all talking of made a speech before
a convention in Illinois.Judge Whipple has been crazy on the subject
ever since--he talks of Lincoln in his sleep; he went to Springfield and
spent two days with him, and now he can't rest until you have seen and
known and heard him.So he writes a note to Lincoln and asks him to take
you to the debate--"

She paused again to laugh at his amazement."But he told me to go to Springfield!"He knew that you would obey his orders, I
suppose.""But I didn't know--" Stephen began, trying to come pass within an
instant the memory of his year's experience with Mr."You didn't know that he thought anything about you," said Virginia.He has more private charities on his list
than any man in the city except Mr.He
thinks a great deal of you.But there," she added, suddenly blushing
crimson, "I am sorry I told you."She did not answer, but sat tapping the seat with her fingers.And when
she ventured to look at him, he had fallen into thought."I think it must be time for dinner," said Virginia, "if you really wish
to catch the train."The coldness in her voice, rather than her words, aroused him.He rose,
took one lingering look at the river, and followed her to the house.At dinner, when not talking about his mare, the Colonel was trying
to persuade Stephen to remain.Virginia did not join in this, and
her father thought the young man's refusal sprang from her lack of
cordiality.Colonel Carvel himself drove to the station.When he returned, he found his daughter sitting idly on the porch."I like that young man, if he is a Yankee," he declared."I don't," said Virginia, promptly."My dear," said her father, voicing the hospitality of the Carvels,
"I am surprised at you.One should never show one's feelings toward a
guest.As mistress of this house it was your duty to press him to stay.""Do you know why he went, my dear," asked the Colonel."He said that his mother was alone in town, and needed him."Virginia got up without a word, and went into Judge Whipple's room.And there the Colonel found her some hours later, reading aloud from a
scrap-book certain speeches of Mr.Lincoln's which Judge Whipple had cut
from newspapers.And the Judge, lying back with his eyes half closed,
was listening in pure delight.Little did he guess at Virginia's
penance!AN EXCURSION

I am going ahead two years.Two years during which a nation struggled
in agony with sickness, and even the great strength with which she was
endowed at birth was not equal to the task of throwing it off.In 1620
a Dutch ship had brought from Guinea to his Majesty's Colony of Virginia
the germs of that disease for which the Nation's blood was to be let
so freely.During these years signs of dissolution, of death, were not
wanting.In the city by the Father of Waters where the races met, men and women
were born into the world, who were to die in ancient Cuba, who were to
be left fatherless in the struggle soon to come, who were to live to
see new monsters rise to gnaw at the vitals of the Republic, and to
hear again the cynical laugh of Europe.But they were also to see their
country a power in the world, perchance the greatest power.While Europe
had wrangled, the child of the West had grown into manhood and taken
a seat among the highest, to share with them the responsibilities of
manhood.Meanwhile, Stephen Brice had been given permission to practise law
in the sovereign state of Missouri.It cannot be said that he was intimate with that rather
formidable personage, although the Judge, being a man of habits, had
formed that of taking tea at least once a week with Mrs.Stephen
had learned to love the Judge, and he had never ceased to be grateful to
him for a knowledge of that man who had had the most influence upon his
life,--Abraham Lincoln.For the seed, sowed in wisdom and self-denial, was bearing fruit.The
sound of gathering conventions was in the land, and the Freeport Heresy
was not for gotten.We shall not mention the number of clients thronging to Mr.Some of
Stephen's income came from articles in the newspapers of that day.What funny newspapers they were, the size of a blanket!No startling
headlines such as we see now, but a continued novel among the
advertisements on the front page and verses from some gifted lady of
the town, signed Electra.And often a story of pure love, but more
frequently of ghosts or other eerie phenomena taken from a magazine, or
an anecdote of a cat or a chicken.There were letters from citizens who
had the mania of print, bulletins of different ages from all parts of
the Union, clippings out of day-before-yesterday's newspaper of Chicago
or Cincinnati to three-weeks letters from San Francisco, come by the
pony post to Lexington and then down the swift Missouri.Of course,
there was news by telegraph, but that was precious as fine gold,--not to
be lightly read and cast aside.In the autumn of '59, through the kindness of Mr.Brinsmade, Stephen had
gone on a steamboat up the river to a great convention in Iowa.On this
excursion was much of St.He widened his circle
of acquaintances, and spent much of his time walking the guards between
Miss Anne Brinsmade and Miss Puss Russell.Perhaps it is unfair to these
young ladies to repeat what they said about Stephen in the privacy of
their staterooms, gentle Anne remonstrating that they should not gossip,
and listening eagerly the while, and laughing at Miss Puss, whose
mimicry of Stephen's severe ways brought tears to her eyes.Clarence Colfax was likewise on the boat, and passing Stephen on the
guards, bowed distantly.But once, on the return trip, when Stephen had
a writing pad on his knee, the young Southerner came up to him in his
frankest manner and with an expression of the gray eyes which was not to
be withstood."I hear you are the kind that cannot be
idle even on a holiday.""Not as bad as all that," replied Stephen, smiling at him."Reckon you keep a diary, then," said Clarence, leaning against the
rail.He made a remarkably graceful figure, Stephen thought.He was
tall, and his movements had what might be called a commanding indolence.Stephen, while he smiled, could not but admire the tone and gesture with
which Colfax bade a passing <DW64> to get him a handkerchief from his
cabin.The alacrity of the black to do the errand was amusing enough.Stephen well knew it had not been such if he wanted a handkerchief.Colfax was too well bred to inquire
further; so he never found out that Mr.Brice was writing an account of
the Convention and the speechmaking for the Missouri Democrat."Brice," said the Southerner, "I want to apologize for things I've done
to you and said about you.I hated you for a long time after you beat me
out of Hester, and--" he hesitated.For the first time he actually liked Colfax.He had
been long enough among Colfax's people to understand how difficult it
was for him to say the thing he wished."You may remember a night at my uncle's, Colonel Carvel's, on the
occasion of my cousin's birthday?""Well," blurted Clarence, boyishly, "I was rude to you in my uncle's
house, and I have since been sorry.""He held out his hand, and Stephen took it warmly.Colfax," he said, "and I didn't understand your
point of view as well as I do now.Not that I have changed my ideas," he
added quickly, "but the notion of the girl's going South angered me.I
was bidding against the dealer rather than against you.Had I then known
Miss Carvel--" he stopped abruptly.The winning expression died from the face of the other.He turned away, and leaning across the rail, stared at the high bluffs,
red-bronzed by the autumn sun.A score of miles beyond that precipice
was a long low building of stone, surrounded by spreading trees,--the
school for young ladies, celebrated throughout the West, where our
mothers and grandmothers were taught,--Monticello.Hither Miss Virginia
Carvel had gone, some thirty days since, for her second winter.Perhaps Stephen guessed the thought in the mind of his companion, for
he stared also.The music in the cabin came to an abrupt pause, and only
the tumbling of waters through the planks of the great wheels broke the
silence.They were both startled by laughter at their shoulders.There
stood Miss Russell, the picture of merriment, her arm locked in Anne
Brinsmade's."It is the hour when all devout worshippers turn towards the East," she
said."The goddess is enshrined at Monticello."Both young men, as they got to their feet, were crimson.But this was not
the first time Miss Russell had gone too far.Colfax, with the
excess of manner which was his at such times, excused himself and left
abruptly.This to the further embarrassment of Stephen and Anne, and the
keener enjoyment of Miss Russell."Why, you are even writing
verses to her!""I scarcely know Miss Carvel," he said, recovering."And as for writing
verse--"

"You never did such a thing in your life!Miss Russell made a face in the direction Colfax had taken."He always acts like that when you mention her," she said."But you are so cruel, Puss," said Anne."That has been the way of the world ever since Adam and Eve," remarked
Puss."I suppose you meant to ask: Mr.Brice, whether Clarence is to
marry Virginia Carvel."Brice," Puss continued, undaunted."I shall tell you some
gossip.Virginia was sent to Monticello, and went with her father to
Kentucky and Pennsylvania this summer, that she might be away from
Clarence."Colonel Carvel is right," she went on.They are first cousins, and the Colonel doesn't like that.But he isn't good for anything in the world except horse
racing and--and fighting.He wanted to help drive the Black Republican
emigrants out of Kansas, and his mother had to put a collar and chain on
him.He wanted to go filibustering with Walker, and she had to get down
on her knees.And yet," she cried, "if you Yankees push us as far as
war, Mr."Oh, I know what you are going to say,--that Clarence has money.""Come, Anne," she said, "we mustn't interrupt the Senator any longer.That was the way in which Stephen got his nickname.It is scarcely
necessary to add that he wrote no more until he reached his little room
in the house on Olive Street.They had passed Alton, and the black cloud that hung in the still autumn
air over the city was in sight.It was dusk when the 'Jackson' pushed
her nose into the levee, and the song of the <DW64> stevedores rose from
below as they pulled the gang-plank on to the landing-stage.Stephen
stood apart on the hurricane deck, gazing at the dark line of sooty
warehouses.How many young men with their way to make have felt the same
as he did after some pleasant excursion.The presence of a tall form
beside him shook him from his revery, and he looked up to recognize the
benevolent face of Mr.Brice may be anxious, Stephen, at the late hour," said he."My
carriage is here, and it will give me great pleasure to convey you to
your door."He is in heaven now, and knows at last the good
he wrought upon earth.Of the many thoughtful charities which Stephen
received from him, this one sticks firmest in his remembrance: A
stranger, tired and lonely, and apart from the gay young men and women
who stepped from the boat, he had been sought out by this gentleman, to
whom had been given the divine gift of forgetting none."Oh, Puss," cried Anne, that evening, for Miss Russell had come to spend
the night, "how could you have talked to him so?He scarcely spoke on
the way up in the carriage."Why should I set him upon a pedestal?"said Puss, with a thread in
her mouth; "why should you all set him upon a pedestal?He is only a
Yankee," said Puss, tossing her head, "and not so very wonderful.""I did not say he was wonderful," replied Anne, with dignity.He had better
marry Belle Cluyme.A great man, he may give some decision to that
family."Then--Virginia Carvel is in love with him.""She thinks she hates him," said Miss Russell, calmly.Anne looked up at her companion admiringly.Her two heroines were Puss
and Virginia.Both had the same kind of daring, but in Puss the trait
had developed into a somewhat disagreeable outspokenness which made many
people dislike her.Her judgments were usually well founded, and her
prophecies had so often come to pass that Anne often believed in them
for no other reason."Do you remember that September, a year ago, when we were all out at
Glencoe, and Judge Whipple was ill, and Virginia sent us all away and
nursed him herself?"Brice had gone out, with letters, when the
Judge was better?""It was a Saturday afternoon that he left, although they had begged him
to stay over Sunday.Virginia had written for me to come back, and I
arrived in the evening.I asked Easter where Jinny was, and I found
her--"

"You found her--?"Sitting alone in the summer-house over the river.Easter said she
had been there for two hours.And I have never known Jinny to be such
miserable company as she was that night."But you did," said Anne, with conviction.Miss Russell's reply was not as direct as usual."You know Virginia never confides unless she wants to," she said."Virginia has scarcely seen him since then," she said."You know that
I was her room-mate at Monticello last year, and I think I should have
discovered it."I heard her repeat once what Judge
Whipple told her father of him; that he had a fine legal mind.He was
often in my letters from home, because they have taken Pa's house next
door, and because Pa likes them.I used to read those letters to Jinny,"
said Anne, "but she never expressed any desire to hear them.""I, too, used to write Jinny about him," confessed Puss."No," replied Miss Puss,--"but that was just before the holidays, you
remember.And then the Colonel hurried her off to see her Pennsylvania
relatives, and I believe they went to Annapolis, too, where the Carvels
come from."Stephen, sitting in the next house, writing out his account, little
dreamed that he was the subject of a conference in the third story front
of the Brinsmades'.Later, when the young ladies were asleep, he carried
his manuscript to the Democrat office, and delivered it into the hands
of his friend, the night editor, who was awaiting it.Toward the end of that week, Miss Virginia Carvel was sitting with her
back to one of the great trees at Monticello reading a letter.Every
once in a while she tucked it under her cloak and glanced hastily
around."I have told you all about the excursion, my dear, and how we missed
you.You may remember" (ah, Anne, the guile there is in the best of us),
"you may remember Mr.Stephen Brice, whom we used to speak of.Pa and Ma
take a great interest in him, and Pa had him invited on the excursion.He is more serious than ever, since he has become a full-fledged lawyer.But he has a dry humor which comes out when you know him well, of which
I did not suspect him.His mother is the dearest lady I have ever known,
so quiet, so dignified, and so well bred.Brice told Pa so many things about the
people south of Market Street, the Germans, which he did not know; that
Pa was astonished.He told all about German history, and how they were
persecuted at home, and why they came here.Pa was surprised to hear
that many of them were University men, and that they were already
organizing to defend the Union.I heard Pa say, 'That is what Mr.Blair
meant when he assured me that we need not fear for the city.'"Jinny dear, I ought not to have written you this, because you are for
Secession, and in your heart you think Pa a traitor, because he comes
from a slave state and has slaves of his own."It is sad to think how rich Mrs.Brice lived in Boston, and what she
has had to come to.One servant and a little house, and no place to go
to in the summer, when they used to have such a large one.I often go in
to sew with her, but she has never once mentioned her past to me."Your father has no doubt sent you the Democrat with the account of the
Convention.It is the fullest published, by far, and was so much admired
that Pa asked the editor who wrote it.Who do you think, but Stephen
Brice!Brice hesitated when Pa asked him to go
up the river, and then consented.Yesterday, when I
went in to see Mrs.Brice, a new black silk was on her bed, and as long
as I live I shall never forget how sweet was her voice when she said,
'It is a surprise from my son, my dear.I did not expect ever to have
another.'Jinny, I just know he bought it with the money he got for the
article.That was what he was writing on the boat when Clarence Colfax
interrupted him.Puss accused him of writing verses to you."At this point Miss Virginia Carvel stopped reading.Whether she had read
that part before, who shall say?But she took Anne's letter between her
fingers and tore it into bits and flung the bits into the wind, so that
they were tossed about and lost among the dead leaves under the great
trees.And when she reached her room, there was the hated Missouri
Democrat lying, still open, on her table.A little later a great black
piece of it came tossing out of the chimney above, to the affright
of little Miss Brown, teacher of Literature, who was walking in the
grounds, and who ran to the principal's room with the story that the
chimney was afire.THE COLONEL IS WARNED

It is difficult to refrain from mention of the leave-taking of Miss
Virginia Carvel from the Monticello "Female Seminary," so called in the
'Democrat'.Most young ladies did not graduate in those days.Stephen chanced to read in the 'Republican' about these
ceremonies, which mentioned that Miss Virginia Carvel, "Daughter of
Colonel Comyn Carvel, was without doubt the beauty of the day.She
wore--" but why destroy the picture?The words are meaningless to all males, and young women might laugh at
a critical time.Miss Emily Russell performed upon "that most superb of
all musical instruments the human voice."Was it 'Auld Robin Gray' that
she sang?I am sure it was Miss Maude Catherwood who recited 'To My
Mother', with such effect.Miss Carvel, so Stephen learned with alarm,
was to read a poem by Mrs.Browning, but was "unavoidably prevented."The truth was, as he heard afterward from Miss Puss Russell, that
Miss Jinny had refused point blank.So the Lady Principal, to save her
reputation for discipline, had been forced to deceive the press.There was another who read the account of the exercises with intense
interest, a gentleman of whom we have lately forborne to speak.It is to be doubted if
that somewhat easy-going gentleman, Colonel Carvel, realized the
full importance of Eliphalet to Carvel & Company.Ephum still opened the store in the mornings, but Mr.Hopper was within the ground-glass office before the place was warm, and
through warerooms and shipping rooms, rubbing his hands, to see if any
were late.Many of the old force were missed, and a new and greater
force were come in.These feared Eliphalet as they did the devil, and
worked the harder to please him, because Eliphalet had hired that kind.To them the Colonel was lifted high above the sordid affairs of the
world.He was at the store every day in the winter, and Mr.Hopper
always followed him obsequiously into the ground-glass office, called in
the book-keeper, and showed him the books and the increased earnings.Hood and his slovenly management, and sighed,
in spite of his doubled income.Hopper had added to the Company's
list of customers whole districts in the growing Southwest, and yet the
honest Colonel did not like him.Hopper, by a gradual process,
had taken upon his own shoulders, and consequently off the Colonel's,
responsibility after responsibility.There were some painful scenes,
of course, such as the departure of Mr.Hood, which never would have
occurred had not Eliphalet proved without question the incapacity of
the ancient manager.Hopper only narrowed his lids when the Colonel
pensioned Mr.But the Colonel had a will before which, when
roused, even Mr.So that Eliphalet was always polite
to Ephum, and careful never to say anything in the darkey's presence
against incompetent clerks or favorite customers, who, by the charity of
the Colonel, remained on his books.One spring day, after the sober home-coming of Colonel Carvel from the
Democratic Convention at Charleston, Ephum accosted his master as
he came into the store of a morning.Ephum's face was working with
excitement."What's the matter with you, Ephum?""No, Marsa, I ain't 'zactly."Ephum put down the duster, peered out of the door of the private office,
and closed it softly."Marse Comyn, I ain't got no use fo' dat Misteh Hoppa', Ise kinder
sup'stitious 'bout him, Marsa.""Has he treated you badly, Ephum?"The faithful <DW64> saw another question in his master's face.He well
knew that Colonel Carvel would not descend to ask an inferior concerning
the conduct of a superior.And I ain't sayin' nuthin' gin his honesty.He straight,
but he powerful sharp, Marse Comyn.An' he jus' mussiless down to a
cent."He realized that which was beyond the grasp of the
<DW64>'s mind.New and thriftier methods of trade from New England were
fast replacing the old open-handedness of the large houses.Competition
had begun, and competition is cruel.Edwards, James, & Company had taken
a Yankee into the firm.They were now Edwards, James, & Doddington, and
Mr.Edwards's coolness towards the Colonel was manifest since the rise
of Eliphalet.But Colonel
Carvel did not know until after years that Mr.Hopper had been offered
the place which Mr.Hopper, increase of salary had not changed him.He still
lived in the same humble way, in a single room in Miss Crane's
boarding-house, and he paid very little more for his board than he had
that first week in which he swept out Colonel Carvel's store.He
was superintendent, now, of Mr.Davitt's Sunday School, and a church
officer.At night, when he came home from business, he would read the
widow's evening paper, and the Colonel's morning paper at the office.Of
true Puritan abstemiousness, his only indulgence was chewing tobacco.It was as early as 1859 that the teller of the Boatman's Bank began to
point out Mr.Hopper's back to casual customers, and he was more than
once seen to enter the president's room, which had carpet on the floor.Eliphalet's suavity with certain delinquent customers from the Southwest
was A wording to Scripture.When they were profane, and invited him
into the street, he reminded them that the city had a police force and a
jail.While still a young man, he had a manner of folding his hands
and smiling which is peculiar to capitalists, and he knew the laws
concerning mortgages in several different states.But Eliphalet was content still to remain in the sphere in which
Providence had placed him, and so to be an example for many of us.He did not buy, or even hire, an evening suit.He was pleased to
superintend some of the details for a dance at Christmas-time before
Virginia left Monticello, but he sat as usual on the stair-landing.Jacob Cluyme (who had been that day in conversation with
the teller of the Boatman's Bank) chanced upon him.Cluyme was so
charmed at the facility with which Eliphalet recounted the rise and fall
of sugar and cotton and wheat that he invited Mr.And
from this meal may be reckoned the first appearance of the family of
which Eliphalet Hopper was the head into polite society.If the Cluyme
household was not polite, it was nothing.Eliphalet sat next to Miss
Belle, and heard the private history of many old families, which he
cherished for future use.Cluyme apologized for the dinner, which
(if the truth were told) needed an apology.All of which is significant,
but sordid and uninteresting.Jacob Cluyme usually bought stocks before
a rise.There was only one person who really bothered Eliphalet as he rose into
prominence, and that person was Captain Elijah Brent.If, upon entering
the ground-glass office, he found Eliphalet without the Colonel,
Captain Lige would walk out again just as if the office were empty.The
inquiries he made were addressed always to Ephum.Hopper
had bidden him good morning and pushed a chair toward him, the honest
Captain had turned his back and marched straight to the house or Tenth
Street, where he found the Colonel alone at breakfast."Colonel," said he, without an introduction."I don't like this here
business of letting Hopper run your store."Lige," he said gently, "he's nearly doubled my income.It isn't the old
times, when we all went our own way and kept our old customers year in
and year out.The Captain took a deep draught of the coffee which Jackson had laid
before him."Colonel Carvel," he said emphatically, "the fellow's a damned rascal,
and will ruin you yet if you don't take advice.""The books show that he's honest, Lige.""Yes," cried Lige, with his fist on the table.But
if that fellow ever gets on top of you, or any one else, he'll grind you
into dust.""He isn't likely to get on top of me, Lige.I know the business, and
keep watch.And now that Jinny's coming home from Monticello, I feel
that I can pay more attention to her--kind of take her mother's place,"
said the Colonel, putting on his felt hat and tipping his chair."Lige,
I want that girl to have every advantage.She ought to go to Europe and
see the world.That trip East last summer did her a heap of good.When
we were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had
written about London, and she was regularly fired.First I must take
her to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall.The Captain walked over to the window, and said nothing.He did not see
the searching gray eyes of his old friend upon him."Lige, why don't you give up steamboating and come along to Europe?You're not forty yet, and you have a heap of money laid by."The Captain shook his head with the vigor that characterized him."This ain't no time for me to leave," he said."Colonel; I tell you
there's a storm comin'."The Colonel pulled his goatee uneasily.Here, at last, was a man in whom
there was no guile."Lige," he said, "isn't it about time you got married?"Upon which the Captain shook his head again, even with more vigor.After the Christmas holidays he had
driven Virginia across the frozen river, all the way to Monticello, in a
sleigh.It was night when they had reached the school, the light of its
many windows casting long streaks on the snow under the trees.He had
helped her out, and had taken her hand as she stood on the step."Be good, Jinny," he had said."Remember what a short time it will be
until June.And your Pa will come over to see you."She had seized him by the buttons of his great coat, and said tearfully:
"O Captain Lige!I shall be so lonely when you are away.He had put his lips to her forehead, driven madly back to Alton, and
spent the night.The first thing he did the next day when he reached
St.Louis was to go straight to the Colonel and tell him bluntly of the
circumstance."Lige, I'd hate to give her up," Mr.Carvel said; "but I'd rather you'd
marry her than any man I can think of."SIGNS OF THE TIMES

In that spring of 1860 the time was come for the South to make her
final stand.And as the noise of gathering conventions shook the ground,
Stephen Brice was not the only one who thought of the Question at
Freeport.The hour was now at hand for it to bear fruit.Meanwhile, his hero, the hewer of rails and forger of homely speech,
Abraham Lincoln, had made a little tour eastward the year before, and
had startled Cooper Union with a new logic and a new eloquence.They
were the same logic and the same eloquence which had startled Stephen.Even as he predicted who had given it birth, the Question destroyed the
great Democratic Party.Colonel Carvel travelled to the convention in
historic Charleston soberly and fearing God, as many another Southern
gentleman.In old Saint Michael's they knelt to pray for harmony, for
peace; for a front bold and undismayed toward those who wronged them.All through the week chosen orators wrestled in vain.Judge Douglas,
you flattered yourself that you had evaded the Question.Do you see
the Southern delegates rising in their seats?Alabama leaves the hall,
followed by her sister stakes.The South has not forgotten your Freeport
Heresy.Once she loved you now she will have none of you.Gloomily, indeed, did Colonel Carvel return home.He loved the Union and
the flag for which his grandfather Richard had fought so bravely.So the Judge, laying his hand upon the knee
of his friend, reminded him gravely.The
very calmness of their argument had been portentous.You of the North are bent upon taking away from us the
rights we had when our fathers framed the Constitution.However the
<DW65> got to this country, sir, in your Bristol and Newport traders, as
well as in our Virginia and Maryland ships, he is here, and he was here
when the Constitution was written.He is happier in slavery than are
your factory hands in New England; and he is no more fit to exercise the
solemn rights of citizenship, I say, than the halfbreeds in the South
American states.""Suppose you deprive me of my few slaves, you do not ruin me.Yet you
do me as great a wrong as you do my friend Samuels, of Louisiana, who
depends on the labor of five hundred.Shall I stand by selfishly and see
him ruined, and thousands of others like him?"Profoundly depressed, Colonel Carvel did not attend the adjourned
Convention at Baltimore, which split once more on Mason and Dixon's
line.The Democrats of the young Northwest stood for Douglas and
Johnson, and the solid South, in another hall, nominated Breckenridge
and Lane.This, of course, became the Colonel's ticket.What a Babel of voices was raised that summer!Each with its cure
for existing ills.Between the extremes of the Black Republican
<DW64> Worshippers and the Southern Rights party of Breckenridge, your
conservative had the choice of two candidates,--of Judge Douglas
or Senator Bell.A most respectable but practically extinct body of
gentlemen in ruffled shirts, the Old Line Whigs, had likewise met
in Baltimore.A new name being necessary, they called themselves
Constitutional Unionists Senator Bell was their candidate, and they
proposed to give the Nation soothing-syrup.So said Judge Whipple,
with a grunt of contempt, to Mr.Cluyme, who was then a prominent
Constitutional Unionist.Other and most estimable gentlemen were also
Constitutional Unionists, notably Mr.Far be it from
any one to cast disrespect upon the reputable members of this party,
whose broad wings sheltered likewise so many weak brethren.One Sunday evening in May, the Judge was taking tea with Mrs.The occasion was memorable for more than one event--which was that he
addressed Stephen by his first name for the first time."You're an admirer of Abraham Lincoln," he had said.Whipple's ways, smiled quietly at his mother.He had never dared mention to the Judge his suspicions concerning his
journey to Springfield and Freeport."Stephen," said the Judge (here the surprise came in), "Stephen, what do
you think of Mr."We hear of no name but Seward's, sir," said Stephen, When he had
recovered."Do you think that Lincoln would make a good President?""I have thought so, sir, ever since you were good enough to give me the
opportunity of knowing him."It was a bold speech--the Judge drew his great eyebrows together, but he
spoke to Mrs."I'm not as strong as I was once, ma'am," said he."And yet I am going
to that Chicago convention."Brice remonstrated mildly, to the effect that he had done his share
of political work."I shall take a younger man with me, in case anything happens.In fact,
ma'am, I had thought of taking your son, if you can spare him."And so it was that Stephen went to that most dramatic of political
gatherings,--in the historic Wigwam.It was so that his eyes were
opened to the view of the monster which maims the vitality of the
Republic,--the political machine.Seward had brought his machine
from New York,--a legion prepared to fill the Wigwam with their bodies,
and to drown with their cries all names save that of their master.Through the kindness of Judge
Whipple he heard many quiet talks between that gentleman and delegates
from other states--Pennsylvania and Illinois and Indiana and elsewhere.He perceived that the Judge was no nonentity in this new party.Whipple sat in his own room, and the delegates came and ranged
themselves along the bed.Late one night, when the delegates were gone,
Stephen ventured to speak what was in his mind.Lincoln did not strike me as the kind of man, sir; who would permit
a bargain."Lincoln's at home playing barn-ball," said the Judge, curtly."Then," said Stephen, rather hotly, "I think you are unfair to him.""Stephen, I hope that politics may be a little cleaner when you become
a delegate," he answered, with just the suspicion of a smile."Supposing
you are convinced that Abraham Lincoln is the only man who can save the
Union, and supposing that the one way to get him nominated is to meet
Seward's gang with their own methods, what would you do, sir?I want
a practical proposition, sir," said Mr.Whipple, "one that we can use
to-night.As Stephen was silent, the Judge advised him to go to bed.Seward's henchmen, confident and uproarious, were
parading the streets of Chicago with their bands and their bunting, the
vast Wigwam was quietly filling up with bony Westerners whose ally was
none other than the state of Pennsylvania.These gentlemen possessed
wind which they had not wasted in processions.And the Lord delivered
Seward and all that was his into their hands.Seward's hope went out after the first ballot,
and how some of the gentlemen attached to his person wept; and how the
voices shook the Wigwam, and the thunder of the guns rolled over the
tossing water of the lake, many now living remember.That day a name was
delivered to the world through the mouths political schemers which was
destined to enter history that of the saviour of the Nation.Down in little Springfield, on a vacant lot near the station, a tall
man in his shirt sleeves was playing barn-ball with some boys.The game
finished, he had put on his black coat and was starting homeward under
the tree--when a fleet youngster darted after him with a telegram.The
tall man read it, and continued on his walk his head bent and his feet
taking long strides, Later in the day he was met by a friend."Abe," said the friend, "I'm almighty glad there somebody in this town's
got notorious at last."In the early morning of their return from Chicago Judge Whipple
and Stephen were standing in the front of a ferry-boat crossing the
Mississippi.The Judge had taken off his hat,
and his gray hair was stirred by the river breeze.Illness had set
a yellow seal on the face, but the younger man remarked it not.For
Stephen, staring at the black blur of the city outline, was filled
with a strange exaltation which might have belonged to his Puritan
forefathers.Now at length was come his chance to be of use in life,--to
dedicate the labor of his hands and of his brains to Abraham Lincoln
uncouth prophet of the West.With all his might he would work to save
the city for the man who was the hope of the Union.The great paddles scattered the brow waters with white
foam, and the Judge voiced his thoughts."Stephen," said he, "I guess we'll have to put on shoulders to the wheel
this summer.If Lincoln is not elected I have lived my sixty-five years
for nothing."As he descended the plank, he laid a hand on Stephen's arm, and
tottered.The big Louisiana, Captain Brent's boat, just in from New
Orleans, was blowing off her steam as with slow steps they climbed the
levee and the steep pitch of the street beyond it.The clatter of hooves
and the crack of whips reached their ears, and, like many others before
them and since, they stepped into Carvel & Company's.On the inside of
the glass partition of the private office, a voice of great suavity was
heard.It was Eliphalet Hopper's."If you will give me the numbers of the bales, Captain Brent, I'll send
a dray down to your boat and get them.""No, sir, I prefer to do business with my friend, Colonel Carvel."I could sell the goods to Texas buyers who are here in the store right
now.""Until I get instructions from one of the concern," vowed Captain Lige,
"I shall do as I always have done, sir.The Captain's fist was heard to come down on the desk."You don't manage me," he said, "and I reckon you don't manage the
Colonel."Hopper's face was not pleasant to see as he emerged.But at sight of
Judge Whipple on the steps his suavity returned."The Colonel will be in any minute, sir," said he.But the Judge walked past him without reply, and into the office.Captain Brent, seeing him; sprang to his feet."Well, well, Judge," said he, heartily, "you fellows have done it now,
sure.I'll say this for you, you've picked a smart man.""Better vote for him, Lige," said the Judge, setting down."A man's got a lot of choice this year;" said he."Two governments,
thirty-three governments, one government patched up for a year ox two.""Lige, you're not such a fool as
to vote against the Union?""Judge," said the Captain, instantly, "I'm not the only one in this town
who will have to decide whether my sympathies are wrong."It's not a question of sympathy, Captain," answered the Judge, dryly."Abraham Lincoln himself was born in Kentucky."If Abraham Lincoln is elected, the South
leaves this Union."The speaker was Colonel Carvel
himself.Whipple cried hotly, "then you will be chastised
and brought back.For at last we have chosen a man who is strong
enough,--who does not fear your fire-eaters,--whose electors depend on
Northern votes alone."Stephen rose apprehensively, So did Captain Lige The Colonel had taken a
step forward, and a fire was quick to kindle in his gray eyes.Judge Whipple, deathly pale, staggered and fell into
Stephen' arms.But it was the Colonel who laid him on the horsehair
sofa.Nor could the two who listened sound the depth of the pathos the Colonel
put into those two words.And the brusqueness in his weakened voice
was even more pathetic-- "Tut, tut," said he."A little heat, and no
breakfast."The Colonel already had a bottle of the famous Bourbon day his hand,
and Captain Lige brought a glass of muddy iced water.Carvel made an
injudicious mixture of the two, and held it to the lips of his friend.cried the Judge, and with this effort he slipped back again.Those
who stood there thought that the stamp of death was already on Judge
Whipple's face.But the lips were firmly closed, bidding defiance, as ever, to the
world.The Colonel, stroking his goatee, regarded him curiously."Silas," he said slowly, "if you won't drink it for me, perhaps you will
drink it--for--Abraham--Lincoln."The two who watched that scene have never forgotten it.Outside, in the
great cool store, the rattle of the trucks was heard, and Mr.The straight figure of the Colonel
towered above the sofa while he waited.Once Judge
Whipple's bony hand opened and shut, and once his features worked.Then,
without warning, he sat up."Colonel," said he, "I reckon I wouldn't be much use to Abe if I took
that.But if you'll send Ephum after, cup of coffee--"

Mr.In two strides he had reached the door
and given the order.Then he came hack and seated himself on the sofa.He had forgotten the convention
He told her what had happened at Mr.Carvel's store, and how the Colonel
had tried to persuade Judge Whipple to take the Glencoe house while he
was in Europe, and how the Judge had refused.Tears were in the widow's
eyes when Stephen finished."And he means to stay here in the heat and go through, the campaign?""It will kill him, Stephen," Mrs.And he said that he would die willingly--after
Abraham Lincoln was elected.He had nothing to live for but to fight for
that.He had never understood the world, and had quarrelled with at all
his life."He didn't dare to look at his mother, nor she at him.And when he
reached the office, half an hour later, Mr.Whipple was seated in his
chair, defiant and unapproachable.Stephen sighed as he settled down to
his work.The thought of one who might have accomplished what her father
could not was in his head.Brinsmade's buggy drew up at Mrs.The Brinsmade family had been for some time in the country.And
frequently, when that gentleman was detained in town by business, he
would stop at the little home for tea.The secret of the good man's
visit came out as he sat with them on the front steps afterward."I fear that it will be a hot summer, ma'am," he had said to Mrs."The heat agrees with me remarkably, Mr.Brinsmade," said the lady,
smiling."I have heard that Colonel Carvel wishes to rent his house at Glencoe,"
Mr.Brinsmade continued, "The figure is not high.""It struck me that a change of air would do you
good, Mrs.Knowing that you shared in our uneasiness
concerning Judge Whipple, I thought--"

He stopped, and looked at her.It was a hard task even for that best
and roost tactful of gentlemen, Mr.He too had misjudged this
calm woman.She saw, as did Stephen,
the kindness behind the offer--Colonel Carvel's kindness and his own.The gentleman's benevolent face brightened:

"And, my dear Madam, do not let the thought of this little house trouble
you.It was never my expectation to have it occupied in the summer.If
we could induce the Judge to go to Glencoe with you for the summer; I am
sure it would be a relief for us all."He did not press the matter; but begged Stephen to call on him in a day
or two, at the bank."What do you think, Stephen," asked his mother, when Mr.Brinsmade was
gone, Stephen did not reply at once.The
vision of that proud figure of Miss Virginia was before him, and he
revolted.What was kindness from Colonel Carvel and Mr.Brinsmade was
charity from her.He could not bear the thought of living in a house
haunted by her.And yet why should he let his pride and his feelings
stand in the way of the health--perhaps of the life--of Judge Whipple?It was characteristic of his mothers strength of mind not to mention the
subject again that evening.But
when he rose in the morning he had made up his mind.After breakfast he
went straight to the Colonel's store, and fortunately found.Carvel
at his desk, winding up his affairs.The next morning, when the train for the East pulled out of
Illinoistown, Miss Jinny Carvel stood on the plat form tearfully waving
good-by to a knot of friends.Presently she
went into the sleeping-car to join the Colonel, who wore a gray liners
duster.For a long time she sat gazing at the young, corn waving on
the prairie, fingering the bunch of June roses on her lap.Clarence had
picked them only a few hours ago, in the dew at Bellegarde.She saw her
cousin standing disconsolate under the train sheds, just as she had left
him.She pictured him riding out the Bellefontaine Road that afternoon,
alone.Now that the ocean was to be between them, was it love that she
felt for Clarence at last?Once or twice she
had suspected him of wishing to separate them.Her Aunt Lillian, indeed,
had said as much, and Virginia had silenced her.But when she had asked
the Colonel to take Clarence to Europe, he had refused.And yet she knew
that he had begged Captain Lige to go.She had seen the change in
Clarence and exulted.The very first day she had surprised him on the
porch at Bellegarde with "Hardee's tactics".From a boy Clarence had
suddenly become a man with a Purpose,--and that was the Purpose of the
South."They have dared to nominate that dirty Lincoln," he said.--"Do you
think that we will submit to <DW65> equality rule?"If they elect him, I will stand and fight them until my legs
are shot from under me, and then I will shoot down the Yankees from the
ground."Virginia's heart had leaped within her at the words, and into her eyes
had flashed once more the look for which the boy had waited and hoped in
vain.He had the carriage of a soldier, the animation and endurance
of the thoroughbred when roused.He was of the stuff that made the
resistance of the South the marvel of the world.And well we know,
whatever the sound of it, that his speech was not heroics.Nor was it
love for his cousin that inspired it, save in this: he had apotheosized
Virginia.To him she was the inspired goddess of the South--his country.His admiration and affection had of late been laid upon an altar.Her
ambition for him he felt was likewise the South's ambition for him.His mother, Virginia's aunt, felt this too, and strove against it with
her feeble might.She never had had power over her son; nor over any
man, save the temporal power of beauty.And to her mortification she
found herself actually in fear of this girl who might have been her
daughter.So in Virginia's presence she became more trivial and petty
than ever.It had of course been a foregone conclusion that Clarence should join
Company A. Few young men of family did not.And now he ran to his room
to don for Virginia that glorious but useless full dress,--the high
bearskin rat, the red pigeon-tailed coat, the light blue trousers, and
the gorgeous, priceless shackle.He
held his big rifle like a veteran, and his face was set with a high
resolve there was no mistaking.The high color of her pride was on the
cheek of the girl as he brought his piece to the salute of her, his
mistress.And yet, when he was gone, and she sat alone amid the roses
awaiting him, came wilfully before her another face that was relentless
determination,--the face of Stephen Brice, as he had stood before her
in the summer house at Glencoe.Strive as she might against the thought,
deny it to herself and others, to Virginia Carvel his way become the
face of the North.Her patriotism and all that was in her of race
rebelled.To conquer that face she would have given her own soul, and
Clarence's.Angrily she had arisen and paced the garden walks, and cried
out aloud that it was not inflexible.And now, by the car window, looking out over the endless roll of the
prairie, the memory of this was bitter within her."Did you rent our house at Glencoe?"Brice was too proud to accept it at your charitable rent,
even to save Mr.The Colonel turned to his daughter in mild surprise.She was leaning
back on the seat, her eyes half closed."Once you dislike a person, Jinny, you never get over it.I always had
a fancy for the young man, and now I have a better opinion of him than
ever before.It was I who insulted them by naming that rent."'Colonel Carvel,' said he,
'I hear you wish to rent your house.''You rented it once
before, sir,' said he.'May I ask you what price you got
for it?'"I told him," said the Colonel, smiling."But I explained that I could
not expect to command that price now on short notice.He replied that
they would pay it, or not consider the place."Virginia turned her head away and stared out over the fields.Brinsmade tells me that young Brice won rather a remarkable case
last winter, and since then has had some practice.I believe he declined some sort of an editorial
position, preferring to remain at the law.""And so they are going into the house?""Whipple refused point-blank to go to the
country.He said that he would be shirking the only work of his life
likely to be worth anything.CHAPTER X. RICHTER'S SCAR

This was the summer when Mr.Stephen Brice began to make his appearance
in public.The very first was rather encouraging than otherwise,
although they were not all so.It was at a little town on the outskirts
of the city where those who had come to scoff and jeer remained to
listen.In writing that speech Stephen had striven to bear in mind a piece of
advice which Mr."Speak so that the lowest may
understand, and the rest will have no trouble."At
the halting lameness of the beginning an egg was thrown,--fortunately
wide of the mark.After this incident Stephen fairly astonished his
audience,--especially an elderly gentleman who sat on a cracker-box in
the rear, out of sight of the stand.This may have been Judge Whipple,
although we have no proof of the fact.Stephen himself would not have claimed originality for that speech.He
laughs now when it is spoken of, and calls it a boyish effort, which it
was.I have no doubt that many of the master's phrases slipped in, as
young Mr.Brice could repeat most of the Debates, and the Cooper Union
speech by heart.He had caught more than the phrasing, however.So
imbued was he with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln that his hearers caught
it; and that was the end of the rotten eggs and the cabbages.The event
is to be especially noted because they crowded around him afterward to
ask questions.For one thing, he had not mentioned abolition.Wasn't it
true, then, that this Lincoln wished to tear the <DW64> from his master,
give him a vote and a subsidy, and set him up as the equal of the man
that owned him?"Slavery may stay where it is," cried the young orator."If it is content there, so are we content.What we say is that it shall
not go one step farther.No, not one inch into a northern territory."Brice was one of the orators at a much larger
meeting in a garden in South St.And this was even a happier event, inasmuch as Mr.Brice was able to
trace with some skill the history of the Fatherland from the Napoleonic
wars to its Revolution.Incidentally he told them why they had emigrated
to this great and free country.And when in an inspired moment he
coupled the names of Abraham Lincoln and Father Jahn, the very leaves of
the trees above them trembled at their cheers.And afterwards there was a long-remembered supper in the moonlit grove
with Richter and a party of his college friends from Jena.There was
Herr Tiefel with the little Dresden-blue eyes, red and round and jolly;
and Hauptmann, long and thin and sallow; and Korner, redbearded and
ponderous; and Konig, a little clean-cut man with a blond mustache
that pointed upward.They clattered their steins on the table and sang
wonderful Jena songs, while Stephen was lifted up and his soul carried
off to far-away Saxony,--to the clean little University town with
its towers and crooked streets.And when they sang the Trolksmelodie,
"Bemooster Bursche zieh' ich aus,--Ade!"a big tear rolled down the scar
on Richter's cheek."Fahrt wohl, ihr Strassen grad and krumm
        Ich zieh' nicht mehr in euch herum,
        Durchton euch nicht mehr mit Gesang,
        Mit Larm nicht mehr and Sporenklang."As the deep tones died away, the soft night was steeped in the sadness
of that farewell song.It was Richter who brought the full force of it
home to Stephen."Do you recall the day you left your Harvard, and your Boston, my
friend?"He had never spoken of the bitterness of that, even
to his mother.And here was the difference between the Saxon and the
Anglo-Saxon.Richter smoked his pipe'mid dreamy silence, the tear still wet upon his
face."Tiefel and I were at the University together," he said at length."He
remembers the day I left Jena for good and all.Ah, Stephen, that is
the most pathetic thing in life, next to leaving the Fatherland.We
dine with our student club for the last time at the Burg Keller, a dingy
little tavern under a grim old house, but very dear to us.We swear for
the last time to be clean and honorable and patriotic, and to die for
the Fatherland, if God so wills.And then we march at the head of a slow
procession out of the old West Gate, two and two, old members first,
then the fox major and the foxes.""The youngsters--the freshmen, you call them," answered Richter,
smiling."And after the foxes," said Herr Tiefel, taking up the story, "after the
foxes comes the empty carriage, with its gay postilion and four.And so we go
slowly until we; come to the Oil Mill Tavern, where we have had many
a schlager-bout with the aristocrats.And the president of our society
makes his farewell speech under the vines, and we drink to you with all
the honors.And we drank to you, Carl, renowned swordsman!"And Herr
Tiefel, carried away by the recollection, rose to his feet.The others caught fire, and stood up with their mugs high in the air,
shouting:

"Lebe wohl, Carl!Salamander, salamander, salamander!Ein ist
ein, zwei ist zwei, drei ist drei!And so they toasted every man present, even Stephen himself, whom they
complimented on his speech.And he soon learned to cry Salamander,
and to rub his mug on the table, German fashion.He was not long in
discovering that Richter was not merely a prime favorite with his
companions, but likewise a person of some political importance in South
St.In the very midst of their merriment an elderly man whom
Stephen recognized as one of the German leaders (he afterwards became a
United States general) came and stood smiling by the table and joined in
the singing.But presently he carried Richter away with him."What a patriot he would have made, had our country been spared to us!""I think he was the best man with the Schlager
that Jena ever saw.Even Korner likes not to stand against him in mask
and fencing hat, all padded.Herr Korner gave a good-natured growl of assent."I have still a welt that he gave me a month since," he said."He has
left his mark on many an aristocrat.""And why did you always fight the aristocrats?"They all tried to tell him at once, but Tiefel prevailed."Because they were for making our country Austrian, my friend," he
cried."Because they were overbearing, and ground the poor.Because the
most of them were immoral like the French, and we knew that it must be
by morality and pure living that our 'Vaterland' was to be rescued.And
so we formed our guilds in opposition to theirs.We swore to live by the
standards of the great Jahn, of whom you spoke.We swore to strive for
the freedom of Germany with manly courage.And when we were not duelling
with the nobles, we had Schlager-bouts among ourselves.""Ja wohl," answered Korner, puffing heavily.The slit in his nose was
plain even in the moonlight."To keep our hands in, as you would say.You Americans are a brave people--without the Schlager.But we fought
that we might not become effete."It was then that Stephen ventured to ask a question that, had been long
burning within him.Korner," said he, "how did Richter come by that scar?He
always gets red when I mention it."Ah, I can well believe that," answered Korner."I will recount that
matter,--if you do not tell Carl, lieber Freund.Brice," Herr Korner continued, "has never heard of the Count von
Kalbach.We at Jena had, and all Germany.Many of us of
the Burschenschaft will bear to the grave the marks of his Schlager.Von
Kalbach went to Bonn, that university of the aristocrats, where he was
worshipped.When he came to Berlin with his sister, crowds would gather
to look at them.exclaimed
Herr Korner, "there is something in blood, when all is said.He was as
straight and strong as an oak of the Black Forest, and she as fair as a
poplar.It is so with the Pomeranians."It was in the year '47, when Carl Richter was gone home to Berlin
before his last semester, to see his father: One fine morning von
Kalbach rode in at the Brandenburg gate on a great black stallion.He
boasted openly that day that none of the despised 'Burschenschaft' dare
stand before him.Before night
all Berlin had heard of the temerity of the young Liberal of the Jena
'Burschenschaft'.To our shame be it said, we who knew and loved Carl
likewise feared for him."Carl chose for his second Ebhardt, a man of our own Germanian Club at
Jena, since killed in the Breite Strasse.And if you will believe me,
my friend.I tell you that Richter came to the glade at daybreak
smoking his pipe.The place was filled, the nobles on one side and
the Burschenschaft on the other, and the sun coming up over the trees.Richter would not listen to any of us, not even the surgeon.He would
not have the silk wound on his arm, nor the padded breeches, nor the
neck covering--Nothing!So Ebhardt put on his gauntlets and peaked cap,
and his apron with the device of the Germanians."There stood the Count in his white shirt in the pose of a statue.And
when it was seen that Richter likewise had no protection, but was calmly
smoking the little short pipe, with a charred bowl, a hush fell upon
all.At the sight of the pipe von Kalbach ground his heel in the turf,
and when the word was given he rushed at Richter like a wild beast.You,
my friend, who have never heard the whistle of sharp Schlager cannot
know the song which a skilled arm draws from the blade.It was music
that morning: You should have seen the noble's mighty strokes--'Prim und
Second und Terz und Quart'.You would have marked how Richter met him
at every blow.Von Kalbach never once took his eyes from the blue smoke
from the bowl.He was terrible in his fury, and I shiver now to think
how we of the Burschenschaft trembled when we saw that our champion was
driven back a step, and then another.You must know that it is a lasting
disgrace to be forced over one's own line.It seemed as if we could not
bear the agony.And then, while we counted out the last seconds of the
half, came a snap like that of a whip's lash, and the bowl of Richter's
pipe lay smouldering on the grass.The noble had cut the stem as clean
as it were sapling twig, and there stood Richter with the piece still
clenched in his teeth, his eyes ablaze, and his cheek running blood.He
pushed the surgeon away when he came forward with his needles.The Count
was smiling as he put up his sword, his friends crowding around
him, when Ebhardt cried out that his man could fight the second
mensur,--though the wound was three needles long.Then Kalbach cried
aloud that he would kill him.Something
was in them that made us think as we washed the cut.But when we spoke
to him he said nothing.Nor could we force the pipe stems from his
teeth.exclaimed Herr Korner, but reverently, "if I live to a
hundred I never hope to see such a sight as that 'Mensur'.The Schlager flew so fast that we only saw the light and heard
the ring alone.Before we of the Burschenschaft knew what had happened
the Count von Kalbach was over his line and had flung his Schlager into
a great tree, and was striding from the place with his head hung and the
tears streamin down his face."Amid a silence, Herr Korner lifted his great mug and emptied it slowly.A wind was rising, bearing with it song and laughter from distant
groups,--Teutonic song and, laughter.The moonlight trembled through the
shifting leaves.And Stephen was filled with a sense of the marvelous.It was as if this fierce duel, so full of national significance to a
German, had been fought in another existence, It was incredible to him
that the unassuming lawyer he knew, so wholly Americanized, had been the
hero of it.Strange, indeed, that the striving life of these leaders of
European Revolution had been suddenly cut off in its vigor.There
came to Stephen a flash of that world-comprehension which marks great
statesmen.Was it not with a divine purpose that this measureless force
of patriotism and high ideal had been given to this youngest of the
nations, that its high mission might be fulfilled?She and her brothers and Jack
Brinsmade used to banter him when he came a-visiting in Bellefontaine
Road.The time was not yet come when neighbor stared coldly upon
neighbor, when friends of long standing passed each other with averted
looks.It was not even a wild dream that white-trash Lincoln would be
elected.Jack, who made speeches for Breckenridge in the face
of Mr.Brinsmade's Union leanings, laughed at Stephen when he came to
spend the night.He joined forces with Puss in making clever fun of the
booby Dutch, which Stephen was wise enough to take good-naturedly.But
once or twice when he met Clarence Colfax at these houses he was aware
of a decided change in the attitude of that young gentleman.This
troubled him more than he cared to admit.For he liked Clarence, who
reminded him of Virginia--at once a pleasure and a pain.It is no harm to admit (for the benefit of the Society for Psychical
Research) that Stephen still dreamed of her.He would go about his work
absently all the morning with the dream still in his head, and the girl
so vividly near him that he could not believe her to be travelling in
England, as Miss Russell said.Puss and Anne were careful to keep him
informed as to her whereabouts.Stephen set this down as a most natural
supposition on their part that all young men must have an interest in
Virginia Carvel.How needless to add that Virginia in her correspondence never mentioned
Stephen, although Puss in her letters took pains to record the fact
every time that he addressed a Black Republican meeting: Miss Carvel
paid no attention to this part of the communications.Her concern for
Judge Whipple Virginia did not hide.How he stood the
rigors of that campaign were a mystery to friend and foe alike.HOW A PRINCE CAME

Who has not heard of the St.And what memories
of its October days the mere mention of at brings back to us who knew
that hallowed place as children.There was the vast wooden amphitheatre
where mad trotting races were run; where stolid cattle walked past the
Chinese pagoda in the middle circle, and shook the blue ribbons on their
horns.But it was underneath the tiers of seats (the whole way around
the ring) that the chief attractions lay hid.These were the church
booths, where fried oysters and sandwiches and cake and whit candy and
ice-cream were sold by your mothers and sister for charity.These ladies
wore white aprons as they waited on the burly farmers.And toward the
close of the day for which they had volunteered they became distracted.Thayer's,
Unitarian, where Mrs.Davitt's, conducted
by Mr.Eliphalet Hopper on strictly business principles, and the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, where Miss Renault and other young ladies of French
descent presided: and Dr.Posthelwaite's, Presbyterian, which we shall
come to presently.And others, the whole way around the ring.Louisans still delight to recall,--that
of the autumn of 1860--Think for a minute.You will remember that
Virginia Carvel came back from Europe; and made quite a stir in a
town where all who were worth knowing were intimates.Stephen caught a
glimpse of her an the street, received a distant bow, and dreamed of her
that night.Eliphalet Hopper, in his Sunday suit, was at the ferry
to pay his respects to the Colonel, to offer his services, and to
tell him how the business fared.Louis face that
Virginia saw (Captain Lige being in New Orleans), and if she conversed
with Eliphalet on the ferry with more warmth than ever before, there is
nothing strange in that.Hopper rode home with them in the carriage,
and walked to Miss Crane's with his heart thumping against his breast,
and wild thoughts whirling in his head.The next morning, in Virginia's sunny front room tears and laughter
mingled.There was a present for Eugenie and Anne and Emily and Puss
and Maude, and a hear kiss from the Colonel for each.And more tears
and laughter and sighs as Mammy Easter and Rosetta unpacked the English
trunks, and with trembling hands and rolling eyes laid each Parisian
gown upon the bed.At the thought of that glorious year my pen fails me.Why mention the
dread possibility of the <DW64>-worshiper Lincoln being elected the
very next month?Why listen, to the rumblings in the South?Pompeii had
chariot-races to the mutterings of Vesuvius.Louis was in gala garb
to greet a Prince.That was the year that Miss Virginia Carvel was given charge of the
booth in Dr.Posthelwaite's church,--the booth next one of the great
arches through which prancing horses and lowing cattle came.Now who do you think stopped at the booth for a chat with Miss Jinny?Who made her blush as pink as her Paris gown?Who slipped into her hand
the contribution for the church, and refused to take the cream candy she
laughingly offered him as an equivalent?None other than Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, Duke of Saxony, Duke of
Cornwall and Rothesay, Earl of Chester and Carrick, Baron Renfrew, and
Lord of the Isles.Out of compliment to the Republic which he visited,
he bore the simple title of Lord Renfrew.Bitter tears of envy, so it was said, were shed in the other booths.Belle Cluyme made a remark which is best suppressed.Eliphalet Hopper,
in Mr.Davitt's booths, stared until his eyes watered.A great throng
peered into the covered way, kept clear for his Royal Highness and
suite, and for the prominent gentlemen who accompanied them.And when
the Prince was seen to turn to His Grace, the Duke of Newcastle, and the
subscription was forthcoming, a great cheer shook the building, while
Virginia and the young ladies with her bowed and blushed and smiled.Colonel Carvel, who was a Director, laid his hand paternally on the
blue coat of the young Prince.Reversing all precedent, he presented
his Royal Highness to his daughter and to the other young ladies.It was
done with the easy grace of a Southern gentleman.Whereupon Lord Renfrew
bowed and smiled too, and stroked his mustache, which was a habit he
had, and so fell naturally into the ways of Democracy.Miss Puss Russell, who has another name, and whose hair is now white,
will tell you how Virginia carried off the occasion with credit to her
country.It is safe to say that the Prince forgot "Silver Heels" and "Royal Oak,"
although they had been trotted past the Pagoda only that morning for his
delectation.He had forgotten his Honor the Mayor, who had held fast to
the young man's arm as the four coal-black horses had pranced through
the crowds all the way from Barnum's Hotel to the Fair Grounds.His
Royal Highness forgot himself still further, and had at length withdrawn
his hands from the pockets of his ample pantaloons and thrust his thumbs
into his yellow waistcoat.And who shall blame him if Miss Virginia's
replies to his sallies enchained him?Not the least impressive of those who stood by, smiling, was the figure
of the tall Colonel, his hat off for once, and pride written on his
face.Oh, that his dear wife might have lived to see this!What was said in that historic interview with a future Sovereign of
England, far from his royal palaces, on Democratic sawdust, with an
American Beauty across a board counter, was immediately recorded by the
Colonel, together with an exact description of his Royal Highness's blue
coat, and light, flowing pantaloons, and yellow waist-coat, and 
kids; even the Prince's habit of stroking his mustache did not escape
the watchful eye.It is said that his Grace of Newcastle smiled twice at
Miss Virginia's retorts, and Lord Lyons, the British Minister, has more
than two to his credit.Miss
Virginia in the very midst of a sentence paused, and then stopped.Her
eyes had strayed from the Royal Countenance, and were fixed upon a
point in the row of heads outside the promenade.Her sentence was
completed--with some confusion.Perhaps it is no wonder that my Lord
Renfrew, whose intuitions are quick, remarked that he had already
remained too long, thus depriving the booth of the custom it otherwise
should have had.This was a graceful speech, and a kingly.Followed by
his retinue and the prominent citizens, he moved on.And it was remarked
by keen observers that his Honor the Mayor had taken hold once more of
the Prince's elbow, who divided his talk with Colonel Carver.What a true American of the old type you were.You,
nor the Mayor, nor the rest of the grave and elderly gentlemen were not
blinded by the light of a royal Presence.You saw in him only an amiable
and lovable young man, who was to succeed the most virtuous and lovable
of sovereigns, Victoria.You, Colonel Carvel, were not one to cringe to
royalty.Out of respect for the just and lenient Sovereign, his mother,
you did honor to the Prince.But you did not remind him, as you might
have, that your ancestors fought for the King at Marston Moor, and that
your grandfather was once an intimate of Charles James Fox.Cluyme, and of a few others whose wealth alone
enabled them to be Directors of the Fair?Miss Isabel Cluyme was duly
presented, in proper form, to his Royal Highness.Her father owned a
"peerage," and had been abroad likewise.He made no such bull as the
Colonel.And while the celebrated conversation of which we have spoken
was in progress, Mr.Cluyme stood back and blushed for his countryman,
and smiled apologetically at the few gentlemen of the royal suite who
glanced his way.His Royal Highness then proceeded to luncheon, which is described by a
most amiable Canadian correspondent who sent to his newspaper an account
of it that I cannot forbear to copy.You may believe what he says, or
not, just as you choose: "So interested was his Royal Highness in the
proceedings that he stayed in the ring three and a half hours witnessing
these trotting matches.He was invited to take lunch in a little wooden
shanty prepared for the Directors, to which he accordingly repaired, but
whether he got anything to eat or not, I cannot tell.After much trouble
he forced his way to the table, which he found surrounded by a lot of
ravenous animals.And upon some half dozen huge dishes were piled slices
of beef, mutton, and buffalo tongue; beside them were great jugs of
lager beer, rolls of bread, and plates of a sort of cabbage cut into
thin shreds, raw, and mixed with vinegar.There were neither salt spoons
nor mustard spoons, the knives the gentlemen were eating with serving in
their stead; and, by the aid of nature's forks, the slices of beef and
mutton were transferred to the plates of those who desired to eat.While
your correspondent stood looking at the spectacle, the Duke of Newcastle
came in, and he sat looking too.He was evidently trying to look
democratic, but could not manage it.By his side stood a man urging him
to try the lager beer, and cabbage also, I suppose.Henceforth, let the
New York Aldermen who gave to the Turkish Ambassador ham sandwiches and
bad sherry rest in peace."Even that great man whose memory we love and revere, Charles Dickens,
was not overkind to us, and saw our faults rather than our virtues.We
were a nation of grasshoppers, and spat tobacco from early morning until
late at night.This some of us undoubtedly did, to our shame be it
said.Dickens went down the Ohio, early in the '40's, he
complained of the men and women he met; who, bent with care, bolted
through silent meals, and retired within their cabins.Dickens
saw our ancestors bowed in a task that had been too great for other
blood,--the task of bringing into civilization in the compass of a
century a wilderness three thousand miles it breadth.And when his Royal
Highness came to St.Louis and beheld one hundred thousand people at the
Fair, we are sure that he knew how recently the ground he stood upon had
been conquered from the forest.For, while the Prince lingered
in front of the booth of Dr.Posthelwaite's church and chatted with
Virginia, a crowd had gathered without.They stood peering over the
barricade into the covered way, proud of the self-possession of their
young countrywoman.And here, by a twist of fate, Mr.Stephen Brice
found himself perched on a barrel beside his friend Richter.It was
Richter who discovered her first.It is Miss Carvel herself, Stephen," he cried, impatient at the
impassive face of his companion."Yes," said Stephen, "I see."exclaimed the disgusted German, "will nothing move you?I have
seen German princesses that are peasant women beside her.Stephen saw, and horror held him in a tremor.What if she should raise her eyes, and amid those vulgar stares
discern his own?And yet that was within him which told him that she
would look up.It was only a question of moments, and then,--and then
she would in truth despise him!Wedged tightly between the people, to
move was to be betrayed.Suddenly he rallied, ashamed of his own false shame.This was because
of one whom he had known for the short, space of a day--whom he was
to remember for a lifetime.The man he worshipped, and she detested.Abraham Lincoln would not have blushed between honest clerks and farmers
Why should Stephen Brice?And what, after all, was this girl to him?Almost the first day he had come to St.Louis the wires
of their lives had crossed, and since then had crossed many times again,
always with a spark.By the might of generations she was one thing, and
he another.They were separated by a vast and ever-widening breach only
to be closed by the blood and bodies of a million of their countrymen.Gradually, charmed like the simple people about him, Stephen became lost
in the fascination of the scene.Suddenly confronted at a booth in a
public fair with the heir to the English throne, who but one of her own
kind might have carried it off so well, have been so complete a mistress
of herself?Since, save for a heightened color, Virginia gave no sign of
excitement.Undismayed, forgetful of the admiring crowd, unconscious of
their stares until--until the very strength of his gaze had compelled
her own.Nor did he wonder
because, in that multitude of faces, her eyes had flown so straightly
homeward to his.With a rough effort that made an angry stir, Stephen flung the people
aside and escaped, the astonished Richter following in his wake.Nor
could the honest German dissuade him from going back to the office for
the rest of the day, or discover what had happened.But all through the afternoon that scene was painted on the pages of
Stephen's books.The free pose
of the girl standing in front of her companions, a blue wisp of autumn
sunlight falling at her feet.The young Prince laughing at her sallies,
and the elderly gentleman smiling with benevolence upon the pair.INTO WHICH A POTENTATE COMES

Virginia danced with the Prince, "by Special Appointment," at the ball
that evening.So likewise was Miss
Belle Cluyme among those honored and approved.But Virginia wore the
most beautiful of her Paris gowns, and seemed a princess to one watching
from the gallery.Stephen was sure that his Royal Highness made that
particular dance longer than the others.It was decidedly longer than
the one he had with Miss Cluyme, although that young lady had declared
she was in heaven.Alas, that princes cannot abide with us forever!His Royal Highness bade
farewell to St.Louis, and presently that same 'City of Alton' which
bore him northward came back again in like royal state, and this time it
was in honor of a Democrat potentate.He is an old friend now, Senator
and Judge and Presidential Candidate,--Stephen Arnold Douglas,--father
of the doctrine of Local Sovereignty, which he has come to preach.We are no sooner rid of one hero than we are ready for
another.Blow, you bandsmen on the hurricane deck, let the shores echo with your
national airs!Let the gay bunting wave in the river breeze!Uniforms
flash upon the guards, for no campaign is complete without the military.Here are brave companies of the Douglas Guards, the Hickory Sprouts, and
the Little Giants to do honor to the person of their hero.Cannon are
booming as he steps into his open carriage that evening on the levee,
where the piles of river freight are covered with people.Transparencies
are dodging in the darkness.A fresh band strikes up "Hail Columbia,"
and the four horses prance away, followed closely by the "Independent
Broom Rangers.""The shouts for Douglas," remarked a keen observer who
was present, "must have penetrated Abraham's bosom at Springfield."Jacob Cluyme, who had been a Bell and Everett man until that day,
was not the only person of prominence converted.After the speech he
assured the Judge that he was now undergoing the greatest pleasure of
his life in meeting the popular orator, the true representative man of
the Great West, the matured statesman, and the able advocate of national
principles.Douglas looked as if he had heard something
of the kind before, he pressed Mr.So was the author of Popular Sovereignty, "the great Bulwark of American
Independence," escorted to the Court House steps, past houses of his
stanch supporters; which were illuminated in his honor.Stephen,
wedged among the people, remarked that the Judge had lost none of his
self-confidence since that day at Freeport.Who, seeing the Democratic
candidate smiling and bowing to the audience that blocked the wide
square, would guess that the Question troubled him at all, or that he
missed the votes of the solid South?How gravely the Judge listened to
the eulogy of the prominent citizen, who reminded him that his work was
not yet finished, and that he still was harnessed to the cause of the
people!And how happy was the choice of that word harnessed!The Judge had heard (so he said) with deep emotion the remarks of the
chairman.Then followed one of those masterful speeches which wove a
spell about those who listened,--which, like the most popular of novels,
moved to laughter and to tears, to anger and to pity.Brice and
Mr Richter were not the only Black Republicans who were depressed that
night.And they trudged homeward with the wild enthusiasm still ringing
in their ears, heavy with the thought that the long, hot campaign of
their own Wide-Awakes might be in vain.They had a grim reproof from Judge Whipple in the morning."So you too, gentlemen, took opium last night," was all he said.Lincoln's election did not interfere with
the gayeties.Clarence Colfax gave a great
dance at Bellegarde, in honor of his cousin, Virginia, to which Mr.Virginia would have liked to have had them in uniform.It was at this time that Anne Brinsmade took the notion of having a ball
in costume.Virginia, on hearing the news, rode over from Bellegarde,
and flinging her reins to Nicodemus ran up to Anne's little
dressing-room.Anne ran over the long list of their acquaintance, but there was one
name she omitted.asked Virginia, searchingly, when she
had finished."I have invited Stephen Brice, Jinny," she said.Am I to be confronted with that
Yankee everywhere I go?It is always 'Stephen Brice', and he is ushered
in with a but."She had dignity, however, and
plenty of it."You have no right to criticise my guests, Virginia."Virginia, seated on the arm of a chair, tapped her foot on the floor."Why couldn't things remain as they were?""We were so happy
before these Yankees came.And they are not content in trying to deprive
us of our rights."Stephen Brice is a gentleman," answered Anne."He spoils no one's
pleasure, and goes no place that he is not asked.""He has not behaved according to my idea of a gentleman, the few
times that I have been unfortunate enough to encounter him," Virginia
retorted."You are the only one who says so, then."Here the feminine got the
better of Anne's prudence, and she added."I saw you waltz with him
once, Jinny Carvel, and I am sure you never enjoyed a dance as much in
your life.""You may have your ball, and your Yankees,
all of them you want.How I wish I had never seen
that horrid Stephen Brice!Virginia rose and snatched her riding-whip.She threw her arms around her friend without more ado."Don't quarrel with me, Jinny," she said tearfully.Brice is not coming, I am sure."And I was going on to
tell you that he could not come."She stopped, and stared at Virginia in bewilderment.That young lady,
instead of beaming, had turned her back.She stood flicking her whip at
the window, gazing out over the trees, down the <DW72> to the river."Because he is to be one of the speakers at a big meeting that night.Have you seen him since you got home, Jinny?We are much worried about him, because he has worked so hard this
summer."exclaimed Virginia, scornfully ignoring
the rest of what was said."Then I'll come, Anne dear," she cried,
tripping the length of the room.She cantered off down the drive and out of the gate, leaving a very
puzzled young woman watching her from the window.But when Virginia
reached the forest at the bend of the road, she pulled her horse down to
a walk.She bethought herself of the gown which her Uncle Daniel had sent her
from Calvert House, and of the pearls.And she determined to go as her
great-grandmother, Dorothy Carvel.How many readers will smile before the rest of this
true incident is told?Miss Anne Brinsmade had driven to town in
her mother's Jenny Lind a day or two before, and had stopped (as she
often did) to pay a call on Mrs.This lady, as may be guessed,
was not given to discussion of her husband's ancestors, nor of her
own.But on the walls of the little dining-room hung a Copley and two
Stuarts.One of the Stuarts was a full length of an officer in the buff
and blue of the Continental Army.And it was this picture which caught
Anne's eye that day."Colonel Wilton Brice, Stephen's grandfather.There is a marked
look about all the Brices.He was only twenty years of age when the
Revolution began.That picture was painted much later in life, after
Stuart came back to America, when the Colonel was nearly forty.He had
kept his uniform, and his wife persuaded him to be painted in it.""If Stephen would only come as Colonel Wilton Brice!""Do you
think he would, Mrs."I am afraid not, Anne," she said."I have a part of the uniform
upstairs, but I could never induce him even to try it on."As she drove from shop to shop that day, Anne reflected that it
certainly would not be like Stephen to wear his grandfather's uniform to
a ball.But she meant to ask him, at any rate.And she had driven home
immediately to write her invitations.It was with keen disappointment
that she read his note of regret.However, on the very day of the ball, Anne chanced to be in town again,
and caught sight of Stephen pushing his way among the people on Fourth
Street.She waved her hand to him, and called to Nicodemus to pull up at
the sidewalk."We are all so sorry that you are not coming," said she, impulsively.For Anne was a sincere person, and
remembered Virginia."That is, I am so sorry," she added, a little
hastily."Stephen, I saw the portrait of your grandfather, and I wanted
you to come in his costume."Stephen, smiling down on her, said nothing.And poor Anne, in her fear
that he had perceived the shade in her meaning, made another unfortunate
remark."If you were not a--a Republican--" she said."A Black Republican," he answered, and laughed at her discomfiture."I only meant that if you were not a Republican, there would be no
meeting to address that night.""It does not make any difference to you what my politics are, does it?""Some people have discarded me," he said, striving to smile.She wondered whether he meant Virginia, and whether he cared.Still
further embarrassed, she said something which she regretted immediately."Couldn't you contrive to come?""I will come, after the meeting, if it is not too late," he said at
length.He lifted his hat, and hurried on, leaving Anne in a quandary.Virginia was coming on
the condition that he was not to be there.Stephen, too, was almost instantly sorry that he had promised.The
little costumer's shop (the only one in the city at that time) had been
ransacked for the occasion, and nothing was left to fit him.But when he
reached home there was a strong smell of camphor in his mother's room.Colonel Brice's cocked hat and sword and spurs lay on the bed, and
presently Hester brought in the blue coat and buff waistcoat from the
kitchen, where she had been pressing them.Stephen must needs yield to
his mother's persuasions and try them on--they were more than a passable
fit.But there were the breeches and cavalry boots to be thought of, and
the ruffled shirt and the powdered wig.So before tea he hurried down
to the costumer's again, not quite sure that he was not making a fool
of himself, and yet at last sufficiently entered into the spirit of the
thing.The coat was mended and freshened.And when after tea he dressed
in the character, his appearance was so striking that his mother could
not refrain from some little admiration.As for Hester, she was in
transports.But still the frivolity of
it all troubled him.He had inherited from Colonel Wilton Brice, the
Puritan, other things beside clothes.And he felt in his heart as he
walked soberly to the hall that this was no time for fancy dress balls.All intention of going was banished by the time his turn had come to
speak.Not caring to sit out the
meeting on the platform, he made his way down the side of the crowded
hall, and ran into (of all people) big Tom Catherwood.As the Southern
Rights politics of the Catherwood family were a matter of note in the
city, Stephen did not attempt to conceal his astonishment.He congratulated Stephen on his speech, and
volunteered the news that he had come in a spirit of fairness to hear
what the intelligent leaders of the Republican party, such as Judge
Whipple, had to say.But the sight of him
started in Stephen a train of thought that closed his ears for once
to the Judge's words.He had had before a huge liking for Tom.Now he
admired him, for it was no light courage that took one of his position
there.And Stephen remembered that Tom was not risking merely the
displeasure of his family and his friends, but likewise something of
greater value than, either.From childhood Tom had been the devoted
slave of Virginia Carvel, with as little chance of marrying her as a man
ever had.And now he was endangering even that little alliance.And so Stephen began to think of Virginia, and to wonder what she would
wear at Anne's party; and to speculate how she would have treated him if
had gone.To speak truth, this last matter had no little weight in his
decision to stay away.But we had best leave motives to those whose
business and equipment it is to weigh to a grain.Since that agonizing
moment when her eyes had met his own among the curiously vulgar at the
Fair, Stephen's fear of meeting Virginia had grown to the proportions of
a terror.And yet there she was in his mind, to take possession of it on
the slightest occasion.When Judge Whipple had finished, Tom rose."Stephen," said he, "of course you're going to the Brinsmade's.""Why, then, you've got to come with me," says Tom, heartily."It isn't
too late, and they'll want you.I've a buggy, and I'm going to the
Russells' to change my clothes.BRINSMADE'S GATE

The eastern side of the Brinsmade house is almost wholly taken up by the
big drawing-room where Anne gave her fancy-dress ball.From the windows
might be seen, through the trees in the grounds, the Father of Waters
below.But the room is gloomy now, that once was gay, and a heavy coat
of soot is spread on the porch at the back, where the apple blossoms
still fall thinly in the spring.The huge black town has coiled about
the place the garden still struggles on, but the giants of the forest
are dying and dead.Bellefontaine Road itself, once the drive of
fashion, is no more.Trucks and cars crowd the streets which follow its
once rural windings, and gone forever are those comely wooded hills and
green pastures,--save in the memory of those who have been spared to
dream.Still the old house stands, begrimed but stately, rebuking the sordid
life around it.Still come into it the Brinsmades to marriage and to
death.Calvin Brinsmade took his
bride there.They sat on the porch in the morning light, harking to
the whistle of the quail in the corn, and watching the frightened deer
scamper across the open.Do you see the bride in her high-waisted gown,
and Mr.Calvin in his stock and his blue tail-coat and brass buttons?Old people will tell you of the royal hospitality then, of the famous
men and women who promenaded under those chandeliers, and sat down to
the game-laden table.In 1835 General Atkinson and his officers thought
nothing of the twenty miles from Jefferson Barracks below, nor of
dancing all night with the Louisville belles, who were Mrs.Thither came Miss Todd of Kentucky, long before she thought
of taking for a husband that rude man of the people, Abraham Lincoln.Foreigners of distinction fell in love with the place, with its
open-hearted master and mistress, and wrote of it in their journals.Would that many of our countrymen, who think of the West as rough, might
have known the quality of the Brinsmades and their neighbors!An era of charity, of golden simplicity, was passing on that October
night of Anne Brinsmade's ball.Those who made merry there were soon
to be driven and scattered before the winds of war; to die at Wilson's
Creek, or Shiloh, or to be spared for heroes of the Wilderness.Some
were to eke out a life of widowhood in poverty.All were to live
soberly, chastened by what they had seen.A fear knocked at Colonel
Carvel's heart as he stood watching the bright figures."Brinsmade," he said, "do you remember this room in May, '46?"Brinsmade, startled, turned upon him quickly."Why, Colonel, you have read my very thoughts," he said."Some of those
who were here then are--are still in Mexico.""And some who came home, Brinsmade, blamed God because they had not
fallen," said the Colonel."Hush, Comyn, His will be done," he answered; "He has left a daughter to
comfort you."In her gown of faded primrose
and blue with its quaint stays and short sleeves, she seemed to have
caught the very air of the decorous century to which it belonged.She
was standing against one of the pilasters at the side of the
room, laughing demurely at the antics of Becky Sharp and Sir John
Falstaff,--Miss Puss Russell and Mr.Tennyson's "Idylls" having appeared but the year before, Anne was
dressed as Elaine, a part which suited her very well.It was strange
indeed to see her waltzing with Daniel Boone (Mr.Clarence Colfax)
in his Indian buckskins.Eugenie went as Marie Antoinette.Tall Maude
Catherwood was most imposing as Rebecca; and her brother George made a
towering Friar Tuck, Even little fifteen-year-old Spencer Catherwood,
the contradiction of the family, was there.He went as the lieutenant
Napoleon, walking about with his hands behind his back and his brows
thoughtfully contracted.It was at tine very height of the
festivities that Dorothy Carvel and Mr.Daniel Boone were making their
way together to the porch when the giant gate-keeper of Kenilworth
Castle came stalking up the steps out of the darkness, brandishing his
club in their faces.Dorothy screamed, and even the doughty Daniel gave
back a step."I'm sorry, Jinny, indeed I am," said the giant, repentant, and holding
her hand in his.demanded Virginia, a little mollified."I've been to a Lincoln meeting," said honest Tom; "where I heard a very
fine speech from a friend of yours.""You might have been better employed," said she, and added, with
dignity, "I have no friends who speak at Black Republican meetings.""No," said Tom, "I meant--"

He got no further.Virginia slipped her arm through Clarence's, and they
went off together to the end of the veranda.He passed on into
the gay drawing-room, but the zest had been taken out of his antics for
that night."Whom did he mean, Jinny?"said Clarence, when they were on the seat
under the vines."He meant that Yankee, Stephen Brice," answered Virginia, languidly."I
am so tired of hearing about him.""So am I," said Clarence, with a fervor by no means false."By George,
I think he will make a Black Republican out of Tom, if he keeps on.Puss and Jack have been talking about him all summer, until I am out
of patience.But suppose he has addressed fifty
Lincoln meetings, as they say, is that any reason for making much
of him?I should not have him at Bellegarde."He is on the Brinsmade charity list.""He is not on their charity list, nor on any other," said Virginia,
quickly."Stephen Brice is the last person who would submit to charity.""And you are the last person who I supposed would stand up for him,"
cried her cousin, surprised and nettled."I want to be fair, Max," she said quietly."Pa offered them our Glencoe
House last summer at a low price, and they insisted on paying what
Mr.Edwards gave five years ago,--or nothing.You know that I detest
a Yankee as much as you do," she continued, indignation growing in her
voice."I did not come out here with you to be insulted."With her hand on the rail, she made as if to rise.Clarence was perforce
mollified."Don't go, Jinny," he said beseechingly."I didn't mean to make you
angry--"

"I can't see why you should always be dragging in this Mr.Brice," she
said, almost tearfully.(It will not do to pause now and inquire into
Virginia's logic.)"I came out to hear what you had to tell me.""Jinny, I have been made second lieutenant of Company A.""Oh, Max, I am so glad!"I suppose that you have heard the result of the October elections,
Jinny.""Pa said something about them to-night," she answered; "why?""It looks now as if there were a chance of the Republicans winning," he
answered.But it was elation that caught his voice, not gloom."You mean that this white trash Lincoln may be President?""The South will not submit to that until every man
who can bear arms is shot down."The strains of a waltz
mingled with talk and laughter floated out of the open window.His voice
dropped to a low intensity."We are getting ready in Company A," he
said; "the traitors will be dropped.We are getting ready to fight for
Missouri and for the South."The girl felt his excitement, his exaltation."And if you were not, Max, I should disown you," she whispered.He leaned forward until his face was close to hers."I am ready to work, to starve, to go to prison, to help--"

He sank back heavily into the corner."Oh, if a woman could only do more!"Do you remember
when you told me that I was good for nothing, that I lacked purpose?""I have thought it over since," he went on rapidly; "you were right.I
cannot work--it is not in me.But I have always felt that I could make a
name for myself--for you--in the army.I am sure that I could command a
regiment.She did not answer him, but absently twisted the fringe of his buckskins
in her fingers."Ever since I have known what love is I have loved you, Jinny.It was so
when we climbed the cherry trees at Bellegarde.And you loved me then--I
know you did.You loved me when I went East to school at the Military
Institute.But it has not been the same of late," he faltered.I felt it first on that day you rode out to
Bellegarde when you said that my life was of no use.Jinny, I don't ask
much.War is coming, and we shall have
to free ourselves from Yankee insolence.It is what we have both wished
for.When I am a general, will you marry me?"For a wavering instant she might have thrown herself into his
outstretched arms.Why not, and have done with sickening doubts?Perhaps
her hesitation hung on the very boyishness of his proposal.Perhaps the
revelation that she did not then fathom was that he had not developed
since those childish days.But even while she held back, came the beat
of hoofs on the gravel below them, and one of the Bellegarde servants
rode into the light pouring through the open door.Clarence muttered his dismay as he followed his cousin to the steps."Nothing; I forgot to sign the deed to the Elleardsville property,
and Worington wants it to-night."Cutting short <DW71>'s explanations,
Clarence vaulted on the horse.Leaning over
in the saddle, he whispered: "I'll be back in a quarter of an hour Will
you wait?""Yes," she said, so that he barely heard.He was away at a gallop, leaving Virginia standing bareheaded to the
night, alone.A spring of pity, of affection for Clarence suddenly
welled up within her.There came again something of her old admiration
for a boy, impetuous and lovable, who had tormented and defended her
with the same hand.Patriotism, stronger in Virginia than many of us now can conceive, was
on Clarence's side.Now was she all
afire with the thought that she, a woman, might by a single word
give the South a leader.That word would steady him, for there was no
question of her influence.She trembled at the reckless lengths he might
go in his dejection, and a memory returned to her of a day at Glencoe,
before he had gone off to school, when she had refused to drive with
him.Colonel Carvel had been away from home.In spite of Ned's beseechings Clarence had ridden off on a wild
thoroughbred colt and had left her to an afternoon of agony.Vividly
she recalled his home-coming in the twilight, his coat torn and muddy, a
bleeding cut on his forehead, and the colt quivering tame.In those days she had thought of herself unreservedly as meant for
him.Dash and courage and generosity had been the beacon lights on her
horizon.Yes, and Clarence
should have these, too.She also had been
at fault, and perhaps it was because of her wavering loyalty to him that
he had not gained them.Her name spoken within the hall startled Virginia from her reverie, and
she began to walk rapidly down the winding drive.A fragment of the air
to which they were dancing brought her to a stop.It was the Jenny Lind
waltz.And with it came clear and persistent the image she had sought to
shut out and failed.As if to escape it now, she fairly ran all the way
to the light at the entrance and hid in the magnolias clustered beside
the gateway.It was her cousin's name she whispered over and over to
herself as she waited, vibrant with a strange excitement.It was as
though the very elements might thwart her wail.Clarence would be
delayed, or they would miss her at the house, and search.It seemed an
eternity before she heard the muffled thud of a horse cantering in the
clay road.Virginia stood out in the light fairly between the gate posts.Too late
she saw the horse rear as the rider flew back in his seat, for she had
seized the bridle.The beams from the lamp fell upon a Revolutionary
horseman, with cooked hat and sword and high riding-boots.For her his
profile was in silhouette, and the bold nose and chin belonged to but
one man she knew.She gave a cry of astonishment
and dropped the rein in dismay.Her
impulse was to fly, nor could she tell what force that stayed her feet.As for Stephen, he stood high in his stirrups and stared down at the
girl.She was standing full in the light,--her lashes fallen, her face
crimson.But no sound of surprise escaped him because it was she, nor
did he wonder at her gown of a gone-by century.Her words came first,
and they were low."I--I thought that you were my cousin," she said.She gave a step backward, and raised her frightened eyes to his."I can't say why," he said quickly, "but it seems to me as if this had
happened before.I know that I am talking nonsense--"

Virginia was trembling now.And her answer was not of her own choosing."It may have been in a dream," he answered her, "that I saw you as you
stand there by my bridle.And what mystery
was it that sent him here this night of all nights?She could not even
have said that it was her own voice making reply."And I--I have seen you, with the sword, and the powdered hair, and the
blue coat and the buff waistcoat.It is a buff waistcoat like that my
great-grandfather wears in his pictures.""It is a buff waistcoat," he said, all sense of strangeness gone.The roses she held dropped on the gravel, and she put out her hand
against his horse's flank.In an instant he had leaped from his saddle,
and his arm was holding her.She did not resist, marvelling rather at
his own steadiness, nor did she then resent a tenderness in his voice."I hope you will forgive me--Virginia," he said."It was I who stopped you," she said; "I was waiting for--"

"For whom?"Colfax," she answered, in another tone.And as she
spoke she drew away from him, up the driveway.But she had scarcely
taken five steps whey she turned again, her face burning defiance."They
told me you were not coming," she said almost fiercely."You know I would not have been
here had I thought you were coming.Anne promised me that you would not
come."What would she not have given for those words back again

Stephen took astride toward her, and to the girl that stride betokened a
thousand things that went to the man's character.Within its compass the
comparison in her mind was all complete.He was master of himself when
he spoke."You dislike me, Miss Carvel," he said steadily.Nor do I flatter myself that it is only because you believe one thing,
and I another.But I assure you that it is my misfortune rather than my
fault that I have not pleased you,--that I have met you only to anger
you."He paused, for she did not seem to hear him.She was gazing at the
distant lights moving on the river.Had he come one step farther?--but
he did not.Presently she knew that he was speaking again, in the same
measured tone."Had Miss Brinsmade told me that my presence here would cause you
annoyance, I should have stayed away.I hope that you will think nothing
of the--the mistake at the gate.You may be sure that I shall not
mention it.He lifted his hat, mounted his horse, and was gone.She had not even
known that he could ride--that was strangely the first thought.The
second discovered herself intent upon the rhythm of his canter as it
died southward upon the road.There was shame in this, mingled with a
thankfulness that he would not meet Clarence.She hurried a few steps
toward the house, and stopped again.Ringing there was her talk with
Stephen Brice, as though it were still rapidly going on.His questions
and her replies--over and over again.Each trivial incident of an
encounter real and yet unreal!His transformation in the uniform, which
had seemed so natural.Though she strove to make it so, nothing of all
this was unbearable now, nor the remembrance of the firm torch of his
arm about her nor yet again his calling her by her name.Absently she took her way again up the drive, now pausing, now going on,
forgetful.First it was alarm she felt when her cousin leaped down at
her side,--then dread."I thought I should never get back," he cried breathlessly, as he threw
his reins to <DW71>."I ought not to have asked you to wait outside.She answered something, There was a seat near by under the trees.To
lead her to it he seized her hand, but it was limp and cold, and a
sudden fear came into his voice.She remembered long how he
stood in the scattered light from the bright windows, a tall, black
figure of dismay.But her own
response, warm half an hour since, was lifeless."Jinny," he said, "what is the matter?"Only I was very foolish to say I would wait for you.""Then--then you won't marry me?""Oh, Max," she cried, "it is no time to talk of that now.I feel
to-night as if something dreadful were to happen.""But war is what we want," he cried, "what we have prayed for, what we
have both been longing for to-night, Jinny.War alone will give us our
rights--"

He stopped short.Virginia had bowed her head an her hands, and he saw
her shoulders shaken by a sob.Clarence bent over her in bewilderment
and anxiety."You are not well, Jinny," he said.But when they went in at the door, he saw that her eyes were dry.Those were the days when a dozen young ladies were in the habit of
staying all night after a dance in the country; of long whispered talks
(nay, not always whispered) until early morning.Miss Russell had not been the only one who remarked Virginia's long
absence with her cousin; but Puss found her friend in one of those moods
which even she dared not disturb.Accordingly Miss Russell stayed all
night with Anne.And the two spent most of the dark hours remaining in unprofitable
discussion as to whether Virginia were at last engaged to her cousin,
and in vain queried over another unsolved mystery.This mystery was
taken up at the breakfast table the next morning, when Miss Carvel
surprised Mrs.Brinsmade and the male household by appearing at
half-past seven.Brinsmade, "what does this mean?I always
thought that young ladies did not get up after a ball until noon.""I am going to ask you to take me to town when you go, Mr."Why, certainly, my dear," he said."But I under stood that your aunt
was to send for you this afternoon from Bellegarde.""There is something I wish to do in town.""I'll drive her in, Pa," said Jack.Will you go with
me, Jinny?""But you must eat some breakfast, Jinny," said Mrs Brinsmade, glancing
anxiously at the girl."Where was Stephen Brice last night, Jack?""I understood Anne
to say that he had spoke; of coming late.""Why, sir," said Jack, "that's what we can't make out.Tom Catherwood,
who is always doing queer things, you know, went to a Black Republican
meeting last night, and met Stephen there.They came out in Tom's buggy
to the Russells', and Tom got into his clothes first and rode over.Stephen was to have followed on Puss Russell's horse.At least I can find no one who saw him.But Virginia did not raise her eyes from her plate."There might have been an accident, Jack," said that lady, with concern."Send Nicodemus over to Mrs.Brice is a Northerner, and may not be able to ride.""He rides like a dragoon, mother," said he."I don't know where he
picked it up.""The reason I mentioned him," said Mr.Brinsmade, lifting the blanket
sheet and adjusting his spectacles, "was because his name caught my eye
in this paper.His speech last night at the Library Hall is one of the
few sensible Republican speeches I have read.I think it very remarkable
for a man as young as he."Brinsmade began to read: "'While waiting
for the speaker of the evening, who was half an hour late, Mr.Tiefel
rose in the audience and called loudly for Mr.Many citizens in
the hall were astonished at the cheering which followed the mention
of this name.Brice is a young lawyer with a quiet manner and a
determined face, who has sacrificed much to the Party's cause this
summer.He was introduced by Judge Whipple, in whose office he is.He had hardly begun to speak before he had the ear of everyone in the
house.Brice's personality is prepossessing, his words are spoken
sharply, and he has a singular emphasis at times which seems to drive
his arguments into the minds of his hearers.We venture to say that if
party orators here and elsewhere were as logical and temperate as Mr.Brice; if, like him, they appealed to reason rather than to passion,
those bitter and lamentable differences which threaten our country's
peace might be amicably adjusted.'But he was interrupted by the rising of Virginia.A high color was on
the girl's face as she said:

"Please excuse me, Mrs.Brinsmade, I must go and get ready.""But you've eaten nothing, my dear.""You ought not have read that, Pa," Mr.Jack remonstrated; "you know
that she detests Yankees."THE BREACH BECOMES TOO WIDE ABRAHAM LINCOLN!At the foot of Breed's Hill in Charlestown an American had been born
into the world, by the might of whose genius that fateful name was
sped to the uttermost parts of the nation.Abraham Lincoln was elected
President of the United States.And the moan of the storm gathering in
the South grew suddenly loud and louder.Stephen Brice read the news in the black headlines and laid down the
newspaper, a sense of the miraculous upon him.There again was the
angled, low-celled room of the country tavern, reeking with food and
lamps and perspiration; for a central figure the man of surpassing
homeliness,--coatless, tieless, and vestless,--telling a story in
the vernacular.He reflected that it might well seem strange yea, and
intolerable--to many that this comedian of the country store, this crude
lawyer and politician, should inherit the seat dignified by Washington
and the Adamses.For to him had been vouchsafed the glimpse
beyond.That was a dark winter that followed, the darkest in our history.Gloom
and despondency came fast upon the heels of Republican exultation.Men
rose early for tidings from Charleston, the storm centre.Would it crumble in pieces before Abraham
Lincoln got to Washington?One smoky morning early in December Stephen arrived late at the office
to find Richter sitting idle on his stool, concern graven on his face."The Judge has had no breakfast, Stephen," he whispered.Shadrach tells me he has been doing that since six this morning, when he
got his newspaper."Stephen listened, and he heard the Judge pacing and pacing in his room.Presently the door was flung open, And they saw Mr.Whipple standing in
the threshold, stern and dishevelled.He came out and sat down in Stephen's chair, striking the newspaper in
his hand, and they feared at first that his Mind had wandered.he cried, "propitiate, propitiate, and again propitiate.Suddenly he turned upon Stephen, who was frightened.But now his voice was natural, and he thrust the paper into the young
man's lap."Have you read the President's message to Congress, sir?God
help me that I am spared to call that wobbling Buchanan President.Perhaps you can tell me why,
if a man admits that it is wrong for a state to abandon this Union, he
cannot call upon Congress for men and money to bring her back.No, this
weakling lets Floyd stock the Southern arsenals.He is for bribing them not to be angry.Take Cuba from Spain,
says he, and steal the rest of Mexico that the maw of slavery may be
filled, and the demon propitiated."And so he went back into his room, shutting
the door.That day no clients saw him, even those poor ones dependent
on his charity whom had never before denied.Richter and Stephen took
counsel together, and sent Shadrach out for his dinner.There arrived a sparkling Sunday, brought down the
valley of the Missouri from the frozen northwest.The Saturday had been
soggy and warm.Thursday had seen South Carolina leave that Union into which she was
born, amid prayers and the ringing of bells.A young lady, who had listened to a solemn sermon of Dr.Posthelwaite's, slipped out of Church before the prayers were ended,
and hurried into that deserted portion of the town about the Court House
where on week days business held its sway.She stopped once at the bottom of the grimy flight of steps leading to
Judge Whipple's office.At the top she paused again, and for a short
space stood alert, her glance resting on the little table in the corner,
on top of which a few thumbed law books lay neatly piled.Once she made
a hesitating step in this direction.Then, as if by a resolution quickly
taken, she turned her back and softly opened the door of the Judge's
room.A book was open in his lap,
but it did not seem to Virginia that he was reading it."Uncle Silas," she said, "aren't you coming to dinner any more?"He looked up swiftly from under his shaggy brows."Uncle Silas," said Virginia, bravely, "I came to get you to-day."Never before had she known him to turn away from man or woman, but now
Judge Whipple drew his handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose
violently.A woman's intuition told her that locked tight in his heart
was what he longed to say, and could not.The shiny black overcoat he
wore was on the bed.Virginia picked it up and held it out to him, an
appeal in her eyes.Many people walking home
from church that morning marvelled as they saw these two on Locust
Street together, the young girl supporting the elderly man over the
slippery places at the crossings.For neighbor had begun to look coldly
upon neighbor.Colonel Carvel beheld them from his armchair by the sitting-room window,
and leaned forward with a start.His lips moved as he closed his Bible
reverently and marked his place.At the foot of the stairs he surprised
Jackson by waving him aside, for the Colonel himself flung open the door
and held out his hand to his friend.The Judge released Virginia's arm,
and his own trembled as he gave it."Silas," said the Colonel, "Silas, we've missed you."Virginia stood by, smiling, but her breath came deeply.Judge Whipple did not go in at the
door--He stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold, his head flung
back, and actual fierceness in his stare."Do you guess we can keep off the subject, Comyn?"Carvel, so used to the Judge's ways, was a bit taken aback by
this question.It set him tugging at his goatee, and his voice was not
quite steady as he answered:

"God knows, Silas.We are human, and we can only try."It lacked a quarter of an hour of
dinner,--a crucial period to tax the resources of any woman.Virginia
led the talk, but oh, the pathetic lameness of it.Her own mind was
wandering when it should not, and recollections she had tried to
strangle had sprung up once more.Only that morning in church she had
lived over again the scene by Mr.Brinsmade's gate, and it was then that
a wayward but resistless impulse to go to the Judge's office had seized
her.The thought of the old man lonely and bitter in his room decided
her.On her knees she prayed that she might save the bond between him
and her father.For the Colonel had been morose on Sundays, and had
taken to reading the Bible, a custom he had not had since she was a
child.In the dining-room Jackson, bowing and smiling, pulled out the Judge's
chair, and got his customary curt nod as a reward."Oh, Uncle Silas," she cried, "I am so glad that we have a wild turkey.The girl carved deftly, feverishly,
talking the while, aided by that most kind and accomplished of hosts,
her father.In the corner the dreaded skeleton of the subject grinned
sardonically.Were they going to be able to keep it off?There was to be
no help from Judge Whipple, who sat in grim silence.A man who feels
his soul burning is not given to small talk.Virginia alone had ever
possessed the power to make him forget."Uncle Silas, I am sure there are some things about our trip that we
never told you.How we saw Napoleon and his beautiful Empress driving
in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people.I never
saw such enthusiasm in my life.And oh, I learned such a lot of French
history.All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus
along the Loire.You really ought to have
gone with us.""I had other work to do, Jinny," said the Judge."I told you that we stayed with a real lord in England, didn't I?""He wasn't half as nice as the Prince.But he had a beautiful house
in Surrey, all windows, which was built in Elizabeth's time.They called
the architecture Tudor, didn't they, Pa?""Yes, dear," said the Colonel, smiling."The Countess was nice to me," continued the girl, "and took me to
garden parties.But Lord Jermyn was always talking politics."The Colonel was stroking his goatee."Tell Silas about the house, Jinny--Jackson, help the Judge again.""No," said Virginia, drawing a breath."I'm going to tell him about that
queer club where my great-grand-father used to bet with Charles Fox.We
saw a great many places where Richard Carvel had been in England.Uncle Daniel read me some of his memoirs when
we were at Calvert House.I know that you would be interested in them,
Uncle Silas."And fought for his country and for his flag, Virginia," said the Judge,
who had scarcely spoken until then."No, I could not bear to read them
now, when those who should love that country are leaving it in passion."Virginia did not dare to look at her father.But the Colonel said, gently:

"Not in passion, Silas, but in sorrow."But the effort was beyond him, and the
flood within him broke loose."Colonel Carvel," he cried, "South Carolina is mad--She is departing in
sin, in order that a fiendish practice may be perpetuated.If her people
stopped to think they would know that slavery cannot exist except by
means of this Union.But let this milksop of a President do his worst.We have chosen a man who has the strength to say, 'You shall not go!'"The saving grace of it was that respect and love
for her father filled Virginia's heart.In his just anger Colonel
Carvel remembered that he was the host, and strove to think only of his
affection for his old friend."To invade a sovereign state, sir, is a crime against the sacred spirit
of this government," he said."There is no such thing as a sovereign state, sir," exclaimed the Judge,
hotly."I am an American, and not a Missourian.""When the time comes, sir," said the Colonel, with dignity, "Missouri
will join with her sister sovereign states against oppression.""Missouri will not secede, sir.""Because, sir, when the worst comes, the Soothing Syrup men will rally
for the Union.And there are enough loyal people here to keep her
straight."Foreign Republican hirelings, sir," exclaimed
the Colonel, standing up."We shall drive them like sheep if they oppose
us.You are drilling them now that they may murder your own blood when
you think the time is ripe."The Colonel did not hear Virginia leave the room, so softly had she
gone, He made a grand figure of a man as he stood up, straight and tall,
those gray eyes a-kindle at last.But the fire died as quickly as it had
flared.Pity had come and quenched it,--pity that an unselfish life
of suffering and loneliness should be crowned with these.The Colonel
longed then to clasp his friend in his arms.Quarrels they had had
by the hundred, never yet a misunderstanding.God had given to Silas
Whipple a nature stern and harsh that repelled all save the charitable
few whose gift it was to see below the surface, and Colonel Carvel had
been the chief of them.But now the Judge's vision was clouded.Steadying himself by his chair, he had risen glaring, the loose skin
twitching on his sallow face.He began firmly but his voice shook ere he
had finished."Colonel Carvel," said he, "I expect that the day has come when you
go your way and I go mine.It will be better if--we do not meet again,
sir."And so he turned from the man whose friendship had stayed him for the
score of years he had battled with his enemies, from that house which
had been for so long his only home.For the last time Jackson came
forward to help him with his coat.The Judge did not see him, nor did he
see the tearful face of a young girl leaning over the banisters above.Whipple, blinded by a moisture strange to
his eyes, clung to the iron railing as he felt his way down the steps.Before he reached the bottom a stronger arm had seize his own, and was
helping him.The Judge brushed his eyes with his sleeve, and turned a defiant face
upon Captain Elijah Brent--then his voice broke.His anger was
suddenly gone, and his thought had flown back to the Colonel's thousand
charities."Lige," he said, "Lige, it has come."In answer the Captain pressed the Judge's hand, nodding vigorously to
hide his rising emotion.cried the Captain, "I wish I knew.""Lige," said the Judge, gravely, "you're too good a man to be for
Soothing Syrup.""You're too smart to be fooled, Lige," he said, with a note near to
pleading."The time has come when you Bell people and the Douglas people
have got to decide.Never in my life did I know it to do good to dodge
a question.We've got to be white or black, Lige.Nobody's got much
use for the grays.And don't let yourself be fooled with Constitutional
Union Meetings, and compromises.The time is almost here, Lige, when it
will take a rascal to steer a middle course."Captain Lige listened, and he shifted from one foot to the other, and
rubbed his hands, which were red.Some odd trick of the mind had put
into his head two people--Eliphalet Hopper and Jacob Cluyme."Lige, you've got to decide.Can you look
on while our own states defy us, and not lift a hand?Can you sit still
while the Governor and all the secessionists in this state are plotting
to take Missouri, too, out of the Union?The militia is riddled with
rebels, and the rest are forming companies of minute men.""And you Black Republicans," the Captain cried "have organized your
Dutch Wideawakes, and are arming them to resist Americans born.""They are Americans by our Constitution, sir, which the South pretends
to revere," cried the Judge."And they are showing themselves better
Americans than many who have been on the soil for generations.""My sympathies are with the South," said the Captain, doggedly, "and my
love is for the South."Both men raised their eyes to the house of him
whose loving hospitality had been a light in the lives of both.When at
last the Captain spoke, his voice was rent with feeling."Judge," he began, "when I was a poor young man on the old 'Vicksburg',
second officer under old Stetson, Colonel Carvel used to take me up to
his house on Fourth Street to dinner.And he gave me the clothes on
my back, so that I might not be ashamed before the fashion which came
there.One day the sheriff sold the
Vicksburg.That left me high and dry in the mud.And he says to me, 'Lige, you're
captain now, the youngest captain on the river.You
can pay me principal and interest when you get ready.'"Judge Whipple, I never had any other home than right in, this house.I
never had any other pleasure than bringing Jinny presents, and tryin' to
show 'em gratitude.He took me into his house and cared for me at a time
when I wanted to go to the devil along with the stevedores when I was
a wanderer he kept me out of the streets, and out of temptation.Judge,
I'd a heap rather go down and jump off the stern of my boat than step in
here and tell him I'd fight for the North."The Judge steadied himself on his hickory stick and walked off without
a word.For a while Captain Lige stood staring after him.Then he slowly
climbed the steps and disappeared.MUTTERINGS

Early in the next year, 1861,--that red year in the Calendar of our
history,--several gentlemen met secretly in the dingy counting-room of
a prominent citizen to consider how the state of Missouri might be saved
to the Union.One of these gentlemen was Judge Whipple, another, Mr.Brinsmade; and another a masterly and fearless lawyer who afterward
became a general, and who shall be mentioned in these pages as the
Leader.By his dash and boldness and statesmanlike grasp of a black
situation St.Louis was snatched from the very bosom of secession.Alas, that chronicles may not stretch so as to embrace all great men of
a time.There is Captain Nathaniel Lyon,--name with the fateful ring.Nathaniel Lyon, with the wild red hair and blue eye, born and bred a
soldier, ordered to St.Louis, and become subordinate to a wavering
officer of ordnance.Lyon was one who brooked no trifling.He had the
face of a man who knows his mind and intention; the quick speech and
action which go with this.Red tape made by the reel to bind him, he
broke.Courts-martial had no terrors for him.He proved the ablest of
lieutenants to the strong civilian who was the Leader.If God had willed that the South should win, there
would have been no occasion.Even as Judge Whipple had said, the time was come for all men to decide.Out of the way, all hopes of compromises that benumbed Washington.No
Constitutional Unionists, no Douglas Democrats, no Republicans now.The speech-making was not done with yet.Partisanship must be overcome, and patriotism instilled in its place.One day Stephen Brice saw the Leader go into Judge Whipple's room,
and presently he was sent for.After that he was heard of in various
out-of-the-way neighborhoods, exhorting all men to forget their quarrels
and uphold the flag.The Leader himself knew not night from day in his toil,--in organizing,
conciliating, compelling when necessary.And, after that solemn inauguration, between him and
Washington.It was an open secret that the Governor of Missouri held out
his arms to Jefferson Davis, just elected President of the new Southern
Confederacy.It soon became plain to the feeblest brain what the Leader
and his friends had perceived long before, that the Governor intended
to use the militia (purged of Yankee sympathizers) to save the state for
the South.The Government Arsenal, with its stores of arms and ammunition, was
the prize.This building and its grounds lay to the south of the
City, overlooking the river.It was in command of a doubting major
of ordnance; the corps of officers of Jefferson Barracks hard by was
mottled with secession.In all the South, Pickens and Sumter alone stood
stanch to the flag.A general, wearing the uniform of the army of the
United States, surrendered the whole state of Texas.Louis Arsenal was next in succession, and the little band of
regulars at the Barracks was powerless to save it.What could the Leader
and Captain Lyon do without troops?That was the question that rang
in Stephen's head, and in the heads of many others.For, if President
Lincoln sent troops to St.And the President had other uses for the handful in the army.There came a rain-sodden night when a mysterious message arrived at
the little house in Olive Street.Brice's eyes as they followed her son out of the door.At Twelfth
Street two men were lounging on the corners, each of whom glanced at
him listessly as he passed.He went up a dark and narrow stair into a
lighted hall with shrouded windows.Men with sober faces were forming
line on the sawdust of the floors.The Leader was there giving military
orders in a low voice.That marked the beginning of the aggressive Union
movement.Stephen, standing apart at the entrance, remarked that many of the men
were Germans.Indeed, he spied his friend Tiefel there, and presently
Richter came from the ranks to greet him."My friend," he said, "you are made second lieutenant of our company,
the Black Jaegers.""But I have never drilled in my life," said Stephen.The Leader, smiling a little, put a vigorous stop to his protestations,
and told him to buy a tactics.The next man Stephen saw was big Tom
Catherwood, who blushed to the line of his hair as he returned Stephen's
grip."Well," said Tom, embarrassed, "a fellow has got to do what he think's
right.""I reckon they'll disown me, Stephen, when they find it out."Richter walked home as far as Stephen's house.He was to take the Fifth
Street car for South St.And they talked of Tom's courage, and of
the broad and secret military organization the Leader had planned that
night.Could he afford to risk his life in the war that was coming, and leave
his mother dependent upon charity?It was shortly after this that Stephen paid his last visit for many a
long day upon Miss Puss Russell.It was a Sunday afternoon, and Puss was
entertaining, as usual, a whole parlor-full of young men, whose leanings
and sympathies Stephen divined while taking off his coat in the hall.Then he heard Miss Russell cry:

"I believe that they are drilling those nasty Dutch hirelings in
secret.""I am sure they are," said George Catherwood."One of the halls is on
Twelfth Street, and they have sentries posted out so that you can't get
near them.And he told him that if
he ever got evidence of it, he'd show him the door.""Do you really think that Tom is with the Yankees?""Tom's a fool," said George, with emphasis, "but he isn't a coward.He'd just as soon tell Pa to-morrow that he was drilling if the Yankee
leaders wished it known.""Virginia will never speak to him again," said Eugenie, in an awed
voice.said Puss, "Tom never had a chance with Jinny.Did you ever know any one to change so,
since this military business has begun?I hear
that they are thinking of making him captain of a company of dragoons.""And that is the company I intend to join.""Well," began Puss, with her usual recklessness, "it's a good thing for
Clarence that all this is happening.I know somebody else--"

Poor Stephen in the hall knew not whether to stay or fly.Emily Russell came down the stairs at that instant
and spoke to him.As the two entered the parlor, there was a hush
pregnant with many things unsaid.Puss's face was scarlet, but her hand
was cold as she held it out to him.For the first time in that house
he felt like an intruder.Jack Brinsmade bowed with great ceremony,
and took his departure.There was scarcely a distant cordiality in
the greeting of the other young men.And Puss, whose tongue was loosed
again, talked rapidly of entertainments to which Stephen either had not
been invited, or from which he had stayed away.The rest of the company
were almost moodily silent.Profoundly depressed, Stephen sat straight in the velvet chair, awaiting
a seasonable time to bring his visit to a close.This was to be the last, then, of his intercourse with a warmhearted
and lovable people.This was to be the end of his friendship with this
impetuous and generous girl who had done so much to brighten his life
since he had come to St: Louis.Henceforth this house would be shut to
him, and all others save Mr.Presently, in one of the intervals of Miss Russell's feverish talk,
he rose to go.Dusk was gathering, and a deep and ominous silence
penetrated like the shadows into the tall room.Impulsively, almost tearfully, Puss put her hand in his.Then she
pressed it unexpectedly, so that he had to gulp down a lump that was in
his throat.Just then a loud cry was heard from without, the men jumped
from their chairs, and something heavy dropped on the carpet.Some ran to the window, others to the door.Directly across the street
was the house of Mr.One of the third
story windows was open, and out of it was pouring a mass of gray wood
smoke.George Catherwood was the first to speak."I hope it will burn down," he cried.Stephen picked up the object on the floor, which had dropped from his
pocket, and handed it to him.THE GUNS OF SUMTER

Winter had vanished.Toward a little island
set in the blue waters of Charleston harbor anxious eyes were strained.God alone may count the wives and mothers who listened in the still
hours of the night for the guns of Sumter.One sultry night in April
Stephen's mother awoke with fear in her heart, for she had heard them.that is the roar now, faint but sullen.That is the red flash
far across the black Southern sky.For in our beds are the terrors and
cruelties of life revealed to us.There is a demon to be faced, and
nought alone.The lightning revealed her as she bent over him.On the wings of memory be flew back to his childhood in the great Boston
house with the rounded front, and he saw the nursery with its high
windows looking out across the Common.Often in the dark had she come to
him thus, her gentle hand passing over aim to feel if he were covered.She said: "Stephen, I am afraid that the war has come."Even he did not guess the agony in her heart.We have nothing left but the little I
earn.And if I were--" He did not finish the sentence, for he felt her
trembling.But she said again, with that courage which seems woman's
alone:

"Remember Wilton Brice.It was the hour he had dreaded, stolen suddenly upon him out of the
night.How many times had he rehearsed this scene to himself!He,
Stephen Brice, who had preached and slaved and drilled for the Union,
a renegade to be shunned by friend and foe alike!He had talked for his
country, but he would not risk his life for it.He saw them passing him silently on the street.Shamefully
he remembered the time, five months agone, when he had worn the very
uniform of his Revolutionary ancestor.And high above the tier of his
accusers he saw one face, and the look of it stung to the very quick of
his soul.Before the storm he had fallen asleep in sheer weariness of the
struggle, that face shining through the black veil of the darkness.If
he were to march away in the blue of his country (alas, not of hers!)she would respect him for risking life for conviction.If he stayed at
home, she would not understand.And
yet he knew that Virginia Carvel and the women like her were ready to
follow with bare feet the march of the soldiers of the South.The rain was come now, in a flood.Stephen's mother could not see in the
blackness the bitterness on his face.Above the roar of the waters she
listened for his voice."I will not go, mother," he said."If at length every man is needed,
that will be different.""It is for you to decide, my son," she answered."There are many ways in
which you can serve your country here.But remember that you may have to
face hard things.""I have had to do that before, mother," he replied calmly."I cannot
leave you dependent upon charity."She went back into her room to pray, for she knew that he had laid his
ambition at her feet.It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came.All through
the Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked
on.Through a wide land was that numbness which
precedes action.Force of habit sent men to their places of business,
to sit idle.South
Carolina had shot to bits the flag she had once revered.On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers.The outraged reply of her governor
went back,--never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states.Little did Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of
all the Union in the number of men she was to give.To her was credited
in the end even more men than stanch Massachusetts.The noise of preparation was in the city--in the land.On the Monday
morning, when Stephen went wearily to the office, he was met by Richter
at the top of the stairs, who seized his shoulders and looked into his
face.The light of the zealot was on Richter's own."We shall drill every night now, my friend, until further orders.Until we go to the front, Stephen, to put down
rebellion."Stephen sank into a chair, and bowed his head.What would
he think,--this man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native
land for his convictions?Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die
for them?How was he to confess to Richter, of all men?"Carl," he said at length, "I--I cannot go."But Richter, suddenly divining, laid his hands
impulsively on Stephen's shoulders."Ach, I see," he said.It shall be
for your mother while you are away."Then, in spite of
his feelings, he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his
character.implored Richter, "I would give a fortune, if
I had it.Ah, my friend, that would please me so.And I do not need the
money now.Spring was in the air; the first faint smell of verdure wafted across
the river on the wind.Stephen turned to the open window, tears of
intense agony in his eyes.In that instant he saw the regiment marching,
and the flag flying at its head."It is my duty to stay here, Carl," he said brokenly.Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped.He realized that
with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable.In
all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change.With the
demonstrative sympathy of his race, he yearned to comfort him, and knew
not how.Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be
broken down.At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared.Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass
door, scarce knowing what to expect,--and scarce caring, as on that
first day he had gone in there.Whipple himself closed the door, and
then the transom.Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their
hiding-place.Brice," he said at last, "the President has called for seventy-five
thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion.They will go, and be
swallowed up, and more will go to fill their places.Brice, people
will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days.But I tell you,
sir, that it will not be over in seven times ninety days."He brought
down his fist heavily upon the table."This, sir, will be a war to the
death.One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let,
and until their homes are all ruins."He darted at Stephen one look from
under those fierce eyebrows."No, sir," he answered, steadily, "not
now."Then he began what seemed a never-ending search
among the papers on his desk.At length he drew out a letter, put on his
spectacles and read it, and finally put it down again.Whipple, "you are doing a courageous thing.But if
we elect to follow our conscience in this world, we must not expect to
escape persecution, sir.Two weeks ago," he continued slowly, "two weeks
ago I had a letter from Mr.cried Stephen

The Judge smiled a little.Lincoln never forgets any one," said
he."He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the
Republican party, and sends you his kindest regards."This was the first and only time that Mr.Whipple spoke to him of his
labors.Stephen has often laughed at this since, and said that he
would not have heard of them at all had not the Judge's sense of duty
compelled him to convey the message.And it was with a lighter heart
than he had felt for many a day that he went out of the door.Some weeks later, five regiments were mustered into the service of the
United States.And in response to his
appeals, despite the presence of officers of higher rank, the President
had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri.Stephen stood among the angry, jeering crowd that lined the streets as
the regiments marched past.Their step was not as steady, nor their files as straight
as Company A. There was Richter, his head high, his blue eyes defiant.And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant
that Stephen himself should have filled.Here was another company,
and at the end of the first four, big Tom Catherwood.His father
had disowned him the day before, His two brothers, George and little
Spencer, were in a house not far away--a house from which a strange flag
drooped.Clouds were lowering over the city, and big drops falling, as Stephen
threaded his way homeward, the damp anal gloom of the weather in his
very soul.He went past the house where the strange flag hung against
its staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged.The house
was thrown wide open that day, and in its window lounged young men of
honored families.And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee
cowardice they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to
the strange banner that they had set up.In the hall, through the open
doorway, the mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen.The guardians
were the Minute Men, organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the
state of Missouri.Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people,
and among these Stephen paused.Two young men were standing on the
steps, and one was Clarence Colfax.His hands were in his pockets, and
a careless, scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the
street.Anger swept over him in a hot flame,
as at the slave auction years agone.That was the unquenchable fire of
the war.The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyed,--and yet
he stopped.What right had he to pull down that flag, to die on the pavement before
that house?CAMP JACKSON

What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning, the Sixth of May, 1861!Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred
feet across, and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is
gathering there.Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to
Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction.Half a mile nearer the river, on the house of the Minute Men, the
strange flag leaps wildly in the wind this day.On Twelfth Street the sun is shining, drums are beating, and bands
are playing, and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited
chargers.One by one the companies are marching up, and taking place in
line; the city companies in natty gray fatigue, the country companies
often in their Sunday clothes.But they walk with heads erect and chests
out, and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them.Louis Grays, Company A; there come the Washington
Guards and Washington Blues, and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and
Davis Guards.Yes, this is Secession Day, this Monday.And the colors
are the Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed.A clatter and a
cloud of dust by the market place, an ecstasy of cheers running in waves
the length of the crowd.Here they come
at last, four and four, the horses prancing and dancing and pointing
quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons.Maude Catherwood squeezes Virginia's arm.There, riding in front, erect
and firm in the saddle, is Captain Clarence Colfax.Virginia is red and
white, and red again,--true colors of the Confederacy.Oh, that was his true
calling, a soldier's life.In that moment she saw him at the head of
armies, from the South, driving the Yankee hordes northward and still
northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation.Down to a trot they slow, Clarence's black thorough-bred arching his
long neck, proud as his master of the squadron which follows, four and
four.The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four, whose
horse is built like a Crusader's, is George Catherwood.And Eugenie
gives a cry and points to the rear where Maurice is riding.Can the Yankee regiments with their
slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it!If there are any Yankees in Twelfth
Street that day, they are silent.And there are
some, even in the ranks of this Militia--who will fight for the Union.There is another wait, the companies standing at ease.Some of the
dragoons dismount, but not the handsome young captain, who rides
straight to the bright group which has caught his eye, Colonel Carvel
wrings his gauntleted hand."Clarence, we are proud of you, sir," he says.And Virginia, repeats his words, her eyes sparkling, her fingers
caressing the silken curve of Jefferson's neck."Clarence, you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river.""Hush, Jinny," he answered, "we are merely going into camp to learn to
drill, that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes.""You will have your cousin court-martialed, my dear," said the Colonel.But he must needs press Virginia's hand
first, and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his.Then he goes
off at a slow canter to join his dragoons, waving his glove at them, and
turning to give the sharp order, "Attention"!Once more she has swept from her heart
every vestige of doubt.Chosen
unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since, Clarence had
taken command like a veteran.George Catherwood and Maurice had told the
story.And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North.The bands are started, the general and
staff begin to move, and the column swings into the Olive Street road,
followed by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot, the horse cars
crowded.Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage, and
behind Ned, on the box, is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up, the
girls can just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front.Olive Street, now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley
wires, was a country road then.Green trees took the place of crowded
rows of houses and stores, and little "bob-tail" yellow cars were drawn
by plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley, surrounded by
a board fence, known as Lindell Grove.It was then a resort, a picnic
ground, what is now covered by close residences which have long shown
the wear of time.Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd, the rich and the poor, the
proprietor and the salesmen, to watch the soldiers pitch their tents
under the spreading trees.The gallant dragoons were off to the west,
across a little stream which trickled through the grounds.By the side
of it Virginia and Maude, enchanted, beheld Captain Colfax shouting
his orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons, and
staggered under it to the line.The
Captain lost his temper, his troopers, perspiring over Gordian knots in
the ropes, uttered strange soldier oaths, while the mad wind which blew
that day played a hundred pranks.To the discomfiture of the young ladies, Colonel Carvel pulled his
goatee and guffawed."How mean, Pa," she said indignantly."How car, you expect them to do it
right the first day, and in this wind?""He is pulled
over on his head."And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by
laughed, too."You will see that they can fight," she said."They can beat the Yankees
and Dutch."This speech made the Colonel glance around him: Then he smiled,--in
response to other smiles."My dear," he said, "you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of
instruction of the state militia.There fly the Stars and Stripes from
the general's tent.Do you see that they are above the state flag?Jinny stamped her foot

"Oh, I hate dissimulation," she cried, "Why can't we, say outright that
we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and
Hessians out of the Arsenal."She had forgotten that one of
her brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians."Why aren't women made generals and governors?""If we were," answered Virginia, "something might be accomplished.""Isn't Clarence enough of a fire-eater to suit you?"But the tents were pitched, and at that moment the young Captain was
seen to hand over his horse to an orderly, and to come toward them.He
was followed by George Catherwood."Come, Jinny," cried her cousin, "let us go over to the main camp.""And walk on Davis Avenue," said Virginia, flushing with pride."Yes, and a Lee Avenue, and a Beauregard Avenue," said George, taking
his sister's arm."We shall walk in them all," said Virginia.The rustling trees and the young grass
of early May, and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military
precision.Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade, proud
fathers and mothers, and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala
dress.Wear your bright gowns now, you devoted women.The day is coming
when you will make them over and over again, or tear them to lint, to
stanch the blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well.Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp
Jackson.All the fashion and beauty of the city were there.The bands
played, the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses,
and walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young
gentlemen in white trousers and brass-buttoned jackets.All was not
soldier fare at the regimental messes.Cakes and jellies and even ices
and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents.Dress
parade was one long sigh of delight: Better not to have been born than
to have been a young man in St.Louis, early in Camp Jackson week, and
not be a militiaman.One young man whom we know, however, had little of pomp and vanity
about him,--none other than the young manager (some whispered "silent
partner") of Carvel & Company.Eliphalet had had political
ambition, or political leanings, during the half-year which had just
passed, he had not shown them.Cluyme (no mean business man himself)
had pronounced Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended
to his own affairs and let the mad country take care of itself.Seeing a regiment of
Missouri Volunteers slouching down Fifth street in citizens' clothes he
had been remarked to smile cynically.But he kept his opinions so close
that he was supposed not to have any.On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, an event occurred in Mr.Carvel's
store which excited a buzz of comment.Barbo, the book-keeper, that he should not be there after four o'clock.To be sure, times were more than dull.The Colonel that morning had read
over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the
impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the
country.The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed.Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's
table.Hopper took an Olive Street car, tucking himself
into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who
might enter.In the course of an hour or so, he alighted at the western
gate of the camp on the Olive Street road.Refreshing himself with a
little tobacco, he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between
the rows of tents.A philosophy of his own (which many men before and
since have adopted) permitted him to stare with a superior good nature
at the open love-making around him.He imagined his own figure,--which
was already growing a little stout,--in a light gray jacket and duck
trousers, and laughed.Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that
kind.These heroes might have their hero-worship.As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree, it so
chanced that he was overtaken by Mr.Only
that morning, this gentleman, in glancing through the real estate column
of his newspaper, had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink.He
reminded his wife that Mr.Hopper had not been to supper of late.Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality.Hopper took it, the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own.But it may be well to remark that Mr.Hopper himself did not do any
squeezing.He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle."I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again, Mr."We only have plain and simple things, but they are
wholesome, sir.Dainties are poor things to work on.I told that to his
Royal Highness when he was here last fall.He was speaking to me on the
merits of roast beef--"

"It's a fine day," said Mr.Letting his gaze wander over the camp,
he added casually, "I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers
since yesterday.I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about,
which came on the 'Swon' marked'marble.'They say Jeff Davis sent the
stuff to 'em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton
Rouge.They're pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now."He was not greatly interested in
this matter which had stirred the city to the quick.Cluyme spoken as one who was deeply moved.Just then, as if to spare the
pains of a reply, a "Jenny Lind" passed them.Miss Belle recognized the
carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known
in St.Every day she drove out, dressed in black bombazine, and
heavily veiled.As the mother-in-law of the stalwart
Union leader of the city, Miss Belle's comment about her appearance in
Camp Jackson was not out of place.she exclaimed, "I'd like to know what she's doing here!"Hopper's answer revealed a keenness which, in the course of a few
days, engendered in Mr.Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of."I don't know," said Eliphalet; "but I cal'late she's got stouter.""That Union principles must be healthy," said he, and laughed.Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma.The appearance
of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind.Eliphalet, too, had seen them.One was the tall young Captain of
Dragoons, in cavalry boots, and the other a young lady with dark brown
hair, in a lawn dress."They think they are alone in the
garden of Eden.But since he's
a captain, and has got a uniform, she's come round pretty quick.I'm
thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms."She glanced at Eliphalet, to find that his eyes were fixed on the
approaching couple."Clarence is handsome, but worthless," she continued in her sprightly
way."I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him.Do you think
she's so very pretty, Mr."Neither do I," Miss Belle assented.And upon that, greatly to
the astonishment of Eliphalet, she left him and ran towards them.she cried; "Jinny, I have something so interesting to tell
you!"The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was
not one of welcome, but Belle was not sensitive.Putting her arm through
Virginia's, she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds,
Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet, and not caring to
hide his annoyance.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered, following the three until they were lost
in the crowd.That expression of Virginia's had reminded him of a
time, years gone, when she had come into the store on her return from
Kentucky, and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival.And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts.She has wealth, and manners,
and looks.Too bad he holds such views
on secession.I have always thought, sir, that you were singularly
fortunate in your connection with him."There was a point of light now in each of Mr.Cluyme continued:

"What a pity, I say, that he should run the risk of crippling himself by
his opinions."And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on--"

But Mr.Cluyme has misjudged his man.If he had come to Eliphalet for
information of Colonel Carvel's affairs, or of any one else's affairs,
he was not likely to get it.It is not meet to repeat here the long
business conversation which followed.Cluyme,
who was in dry goods himself, was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet
as when he met him.But he had a greater respect than ever for the
shrewdness of the business manager of Carvel & Company..........................

That same Thursday, when the first families of the city were whispering
jubilantly in each other's ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and
stands of arms at Camp Jackson, something of significance was happening
within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal,
far to the southward.The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen.Richter gone, and the
Judge often away in mysterious conference, he was left for hours at
a spell the sole tenant of the office.Fortunately there was work of
Richter's and of Mr.Whipple's left undone that kept him busy.This
Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best
black coat which he wore on occasions.His manner had recently lost much
of its gruffness."Stephen," said he, "they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the
regiments at the arsenal.asked Stephen, when they had reached the
street."Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the
first trick, sir," said the Judge.As they got on the Fifth Street car, Stephen's attention was at once
attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner, with his children about
him.He was lean, and he had a face of great keenness and animation.He
had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of
military abruptness."That is Major William T. Sherman," said the Judge to Stephen."He
used to be in the army, and fought in the Mexican War.He came here two
months ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line."They crossed over to him, the Judge introducing Stephen to Major
Sherman, who looked at him very hard, and then decided to bestow on him
a vigorous nod."Well, Whipple," he said, "this nation is going to the devil; eh?"For it was a bold man who expressed
radical opinions (provided they were not Southern opinions) in a St."Who's man enough in Washington
to shake his fist in a rebel's face?Our leniency--our timidity--has
paralyzed us, sir."By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in
the conversation.Major Sherman paid them no attention, and the Judge,
once launched in an argument, forgot his surroundings."Seventy-five thousand for three months!"said the Major, vehemently,
"a bucketful on a conflagration I tell you, Whipple, we'll need all the
water we've got in the North."The Judge expressed his belief in this, and also that Mr.Lincoln would
draw all the water before he got through.Now's the time to stop
'em.The longer we let 'em rear and kick, the harder to break 'em.You
don't catch me going back to the army for three months.If they want me,
they've got to guarantee me three years.Turning
to Stephen, he added: "Don't you sign any three months' contract, young
man."By this time the car was full, and silent.No one had
offered to quarrel with the Major.Nor did it seem likely that any one
would."I'm afraid I can't go, sir.""Because, sir," said the Judge, bluntly, "his mother's a widow, and they
have no money.He was a lieutenant in one of Blair's companies before
the call came."The Major looked at Stephen, and his expression changed.Stephen's expression must have satisfied him, but he nodded again, more
vigorously than before.But he hoped to fall out of the talk.Much to his
discomfiture, the Major gave him another of those queer looks.His whole
manner, and even his appearance, reminded Stephen strangely of Captain
Elijah Brent."Aren't you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile
Library Hall?"At that the Major put out his hand impulsively, and gripped Stephen's."Well, sir," he said, "I have yet to read a more sensible speech, except
some of Abraham Lincoln's.Brinsmade gave it to me to read.Whipple,
that speech reminded me of Lincoln.Lincoln's debate with Judge Douglas at 'Freeport," said
Stephen; beginning to be amused."I admire your frankness, sir," he said."I meant to say that its logic
rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln.""I tried to learn what I could from him, Major Sherman."At length the car stopped, and they passed into the Arsenal grounds.Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments, all at last
in the blue of their country's service.Old soldiers with baskets of
cartridges were stepping from file to file, giving handfuls to the
recruits.Many of these thrust them in their pockets, for there were not
enough belts to go around.The men were standing at ease, and as Stephen
saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned.It was driven away again by Major Sherman's vivacious comments.For
suddenly Captain Lyon, the man of the hour, came into view.cried the Major, "he's a man after my own heart.Just
look at him running about with his hair flying in the wind, and the
papers bulging from his pockets.But
this isn't the time to be dignified.If there were some like Lyon in
Washington, our troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time.The gallant Captain was a sight, indeed, and vividly described by Major
Sherman's picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment,
and from company to company, with his sandy hair awry, pointing,
gesticulating, commanding.In him Stephen recognized the force that had
swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith, that snapped the
tape with which they had tied him.Would he be duped by the Governor's ruse of establishing a State Camp at
this time?Stephen, as he gazed at him, was sure that he would not.This
man could see to the bottom, through every specious argument.Little
matters of law and precedence did not trouble him.Nor did he believe
elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops
were there for peace.After the ranks were broken, Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to
Captain Lyon and the Union Leader, who was now a Colonel of one of
the Volunteer regiments.Stephen sought Richter, who told him that the
regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow, prepared to march."We are not consulted, my friend," he said."Will you come into my
quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel?"It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship
was gone.To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were
asunder, and he was become an outcast.THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED

That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something
was to happen.For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension
which comes after sleep when suddenly he remembered yesterday's
incidents at the Arsenal, and leaped out of bed."I think that Lyon is going to attack Camp Jackson to-day," he said to
his mother after breakfast, when Hester had left the room."I went down to the Arsenal with the Judge yesterday and saw them
finishing the equipment of the new regiments.Any one could see that from the way Lyon was flying about.I think he
must have proof that the Camp Jackson people have received supplies from
the South."Brice looked fixedly at her son, and then smiled in spite of the
apprehension she felt."Is that why you were working over that map of the city last night?""I was trying to see how Lyon would dispose his troops.I meant to tell
you about a gentleman we met in the street car, a Major Sherman who used
to be in the army.Brinsmade knows him, and Judge Whipple, and many
other prominent men here.Louis some months ago to take
the position of president of the Fifth Street Line.He is the keenest,
the most original man I have ever met.As long as I live I shall never
forget his description of Lyon.""Is the Major going back into the army?"Brice, Stephen
did not remark the little falter in her voice.He laughed over the
recollection of the conversation in the street car."Not unless matters in Washington change to suit him," he said."He
thinks that things have been very badly managed, and does not scruple
to say so anywhere.I could not have believed it possible that two men
could have talked in public as he and Judge Whipple did yesterday and
not be shot down.I thought that it was as much as a man's life is worth
to mention allegiance to the Union here in a crowd.Sherman pitched into the Rebels in that car full of people was enough to
make your hair stand on end.""He must be a bold man," murmured Mrs."Does he think that the--the Rebellion can be put down?""Not with seventy-five thousand men, nor with ten times that number."Brice sighed, and furtively wiped her eyes with her handkerchief."I am afraid we shall see great misery, Stephen," she said.From that peaceful little room war and its horrors seemed
very far away.The morning sun poured in through the south windows and
was scattered by the silver on the sideboard.From above, on the wall,
Colonel Wilton Brice gazed soberly down.Stephen's eyes lighted on the
portrait, and his thoughts flew back to the boyhood days when he used to
ply his father with questions about it.Then the picture had suggested
only the glory and honor which illumines the page of history.Something
worthy to look back upon, to keep ones head high.The hatred and the
suffering and the tears, the heartrending, tearing apart for all time of
loving ones who have grown together,--these were not upon that canvas,
Will war ever be painted with a wart?The sound of feet was heard on the pavement.Stephen rose, glancing at
his mother."I am going to the Arsenal," he said.To her, as has been said, was given wisdom beyond most women.She did
not try to prevent him as he kissed her good-by.But when the door had
shut behind him, a little cry escaped her, and she ran to the window to
strain her eyes after him until he had turned the corner below.His steps led him irresistibly past the house of the strange flag,
ominously quiet at that early hour.At sight of it anger made him hot
again.Louis stood at the end of the line, fast
filling with curious people who had read in their papers that morning of
the equipment of the new troops.There was little talk among them, and
that little guarded.It was a May morning to rouse a sluggard; the night air tingled into
life at the touch of the sunshine, the trees in the flitting glory
of their first green.Stephen found the shaded street in front of the
Arsenal already filled with an expectant crowd.Sharp commands broke the
silence, and he saw the blue regiments forming on the lawn inside the
wall.Truly, events were in the air,--great events in which he had no
part.As he stood leaning against a tree-box by the curb, dragged down once
more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard familiar voices
close beside him.Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr.Hopper," he said, "in spite of what you say, I expect you
are dust as eager as I am to see what is going on.You've taken an early
start this morning for sightseeing."Eliphalet's equanimity was far from shaken."I don't cal'late to take a great deal of stock in the military," he
answered.And a man must keep an eye on what
is moving."Cluyme ran his hand through his chop whiskers, and lowered his
voice."You're right, Hopper," he assented."And if this city is going to be
Union, we ought to know it right away."Stephen, listening with growing indignation to this talk, was unaware of
a man who stood on the other side of the tree, and who now came forward
before Mr."My friend," said the stranger, quietly, "I think we have met before,
when your actions were not greatly to your credit.I do not forget a
face, even when I see it in the dark.Now I hear you utter words which
are a disgrace to a citizen of the United States.As soon as Stephen recovered from the shock of his surprise, he saw that
Eliphalet had changed countenance.The manner of an important man of
affairs, which he hay so assiduously cultivated, fell away from him.He
took a step backward, and his eyes made an ugly shift.Stephen rejoiced
to see the stranger turn his back on the manager of Carvel & Company
before that dignitary had time to depart, and stand unconcernedly there
as if nothing had occurred.He was not a man you would look at twice, ordinarily, he was smoking a
great El Sol cigar.He wore clothes that were anything but new, a slouch
hat, and coarse grained, square-toed boots.His trousers were creased at
the knees.His head fell forward a little from his square shoulders, and
leaned a bit to one side, as if meditatively.He had a light brown beard
that was reddish in the sun, and he was rather short than otherwise.And yet the very plainness of the man's
appearance only added to his curiosity.His
words, his action, too, had been remarkable.The art of administering
a rebuke like that was not given to many men.It was perfectly quiet,
perfectly final.And then, when it was over, he had turned his back and
dismissed it.Next Stephen began to wonder what he could know about Hopper.Stephen
had suspected Eliphalet of subordinating principles to business gain,
and hence the conversation with Mr.Cluyme had given him no shock in
the way of a revelation, But if Hopper were a rogue, ought not Colonel
Carvel to hear it?Ought not he, Stephen Brice, to ask this man with the
cigar what he knew, and tell Judge Whipple?The sudden rattle of drums
gave him a start, and cruelly reminded him of the gulf of prejudice and
hatred fast widening between the friends.All this time the stranger stood impassively chewing his cigar, his hand
against the tree-box.A regiment in column came out of the Arsenal gate,
the Union leader in his colonel's uniform, on horseback at its head.He pulled up in the street opposite to Stephen, and sat in his saddle,
chatting with other officers around him.Then the stranger stepped across the limestone gutter and walked up
to the Colonel's horse, He was still smoking.This move, too, was
surprising enough, It argued even more assurance."Colonel Blair, my name is Grant," he said briefly.The Colonel faced quickly about, and held out his gloved hand cordially,
"Captain Ulysses Grant," said he; "of the old army?""I wanted to wish you luck," he said."Thank you, Grant," answered the Colonel."I moved to Illinois after I left here," replied Mr.Grant, as quietly
as before, "and have been in Galena, in the Leather business there.I
went down to Springfield with the company they organized in Galena, to
be of any help I could.They made me a clerk in the adjutant general's
office of the state I ruled blanks, and made out forms for a while."He
paused, as if to let the humble character of this position sink into
the Colonel's comprehension."Then they found out that I'd been
quartermaster and commissary, and knew something about military orders
Now I'm a state mustering officer.I came down to Belleville to muster
in a regiment, which wasn't ready.And so I ran over here to see what
you fellows were doing."If this humble account had been delivered volubly, and in another tone,
it is probable that the citizen-colonel would not have listened, since
the events of that day were to crown his work of a winter.Grant
possessed a manner of holding attention.. It was very evident, however;
that Colonel Blair had other things to think of.Nevertheless he said
kindly:

"Aren't you going in, Grant?""I can't afford to go in as a captain of volunteers," was the calm
reply: "I served nine years in the regular army and I think I can
command a regiment."The Colonel, whose attention was called away at that moment, did not
reply.Some of the younger officers
who were there, laughed as they followed his retreating figure.cried one, a lieutenant whom Stephen recognized
as having been a bookkeeper at Edwards, James, & Doddington's, and whose
stiff blue uniform coat creased awkwardly."I guess I'm about as fit to
command a regiment as Grant is.""That man's forty years old, if he's a day," put in another."I remember
when he came here to St.He'd resigned from
the army on the Pacific Coast.He put up a log cabin down on the Gravois
Road, and there he lived in the hardest luck of any man I ever saw until
last year."I spotted him by the El Sol cigar.He used to bring a
load of wood to the city once in a while, and then he'd go over to the
Planters' House, or somewhere else, and smoke one of these long fellows,
and sit against the wall as silent as a wooden Indian.After that he
came up to the city without his family and went into real estate one
winter.Curious, it is just a year ago this
month than he went over to Illinois.He's an honest fellow, and hard
working enough, but he don't know how.laughed the first, again, as of this in particular
had struck his sense of humor."I guess he won't get a regiment in a
hurry, There's lots of those military carpet-baggers hanging around for
good jobs now.""He might fool you fellows yet," said the one caller, though his tone
was not one of conviction."I understand he had a first-rate record an
the Mexican War."Just then an aide rode up, and the Colonel gave a sharp command which
put an end to this desultory talk.As the First Regiment took up
the march, the words "Camp Jackson" ran from mouth to mouth on the
sidewalks.Catching fire, Stephen ran with the crowd, and leaping on
passing street car, was borne cityward with the drums of the coming
hosts beating in his ears.In the city, shutters were going up on the stores.The streets were
filled with, restless citizens seeking news, and drays were halted here
and there on the corners, the white eyes and frenzied calls of the <DW64>
drivers betraying their excitement.While Stephen related to his mother
the events of the morning, Hester burned the dinner.It lay; still
untouched, on the table when the throbbing of drums sent them to the
front steps.Sigel's regiment had swung into the street, drawing in its
wake a seething crowd.Three persons came out of the big house next door.One was Anna
Brinsmade; and there was her father, his white hairs uncovered.His sister was cringing to him appealingly, and he
struggling in her grasp.Out of his coat pocket hung the curved butt of
a pepperbox revolver."Do you think I can stay here while my
people are shot down by a lot of damned Dutchman?"Brinsmade, sternly, "I cannot let you join a mob.I
cannot let you shoot at men who carry the Union flag.""You cannot prevent me, sir," shouted the young man, in a frenzy."When
foreigners take our flag for them own, it is time for us to shoot them
down."Wrenching himself free, he ran down the steps and up the street ahead of
the regiment.Then the soldiers and the noisy crowd were upon them and
while these were passing the two stood there as in a dream.After that
silence fell upon the street, and Mr.Brinsmade turned and went back
into the house, his head bowed as in prayer.Stephen and his mother drew
back, but Anne saw them."He is a rebel," she faltered.She looked at Stephen appealingly, unashamed of the tears in her eyes."I cannot stay here mother," he said.As he slammed the gate, Anne ran down the steps calling his name.He
paused, and she caught his sleeve."I knew you would go," she said, "I knew you would go.Oh, Stephen, you
have a cool head.But when he reached the corner and
looked back he saw that she had gone in at his own little gate to
meet his mother.Now and again he was
stopped by feverish questions, but at length he reached the top of the
second ridge from the river, along which crowded Eighteenth Street now
runs.Spencer Catherwood had
built two years before on the outskirts of the town, with the wall at
the side, and the brick stable and stable yard.As Stephen approached
it, the thought came to him how little this world's goods avail in times
of trouble.One of the big Catherwood boys was in the blue marching
regiment that day, and had been told by his father never again to darken
his doors.Another was in Clarence Colfax's company of dragoons, and
still another had fled southward the night after Sumter.Stephen stopped at the crest of the hill, in the white dust of the
new-turned street, to gaze westward.Clouds were gathering in the sky,
but the sun still shone brightly, Half way up the rise two blue lines
had crawled, followed by black splotches, and at the southwest was the
glint of the sun on rifle barrels.Directed by a genius in the art of
war, the regiments were closing about Camp Jackson.As he stood there meditating and paying no attention to those who
hurried past, a few familiar notes were struck on a piano.They came
through the wide-shuttered window above his head.Then a girl's voice
rose above the notes, in tones that were exultant:--

       "Away down South in de fields of cotton,
        Cinnamon seed and sandy bottom,
        Look away, look away, Look away, look away.Den I wish I was in Dixie's Land,
        Oh, oh!In Dixie's Land I'll take my stand,
        And live and die in Dixie's Land.The song ceased amid peals of girlish laughter.Jinny Carvel, how dare you!""We
shall have a whole regiment of Hessians in here."Old Uncle Ben, the Catherwoods' coachman, came out of the stable yard.The whites of his eyes were rolling, half in amusement, half in terror.Seeing Stephen standing there, he exclaimed:

"Mistah Brice, if de Dutch take Camp Jackson, is we <DW65>s gwinter be
free?"Stephen did not answer, for the piano had started again,

       "If ever I consent to be married,
        And who could refuse a good mate?The man whom I give my hand to,
        Must believe in the Rights of the State."Then the blinds were flung aside, and a young lady in
a dress of white trimmed with crimson stood in the window, smiling.For an
instant she stared at him, and then turned to the girls crowding behind
her.What she said, he did not wait to hear.THE TENTH OF MAY

Would the sons of the first families surrender, "Never!"cried a young
lady who sat behind the blinds in Mrs.It seemed to
her when she stopped to listen for the first guns of the coming battle
that the tumult in her heart would drown their roar."But, Jinny," ventured that Miss Puss Russell who never feared to speak
her mind, "it would be folly for them to fight.The Dutch and Yankees
outnumber them ten to one, and they haven't any powder and bullets.""And Camp Jackson is down in a hollow," said Maude Catherwood,
dejectedly.And yet hopefully, too, for at the thought of bloodshed she
was near to fainting."Oh," exclaimed Virginia, passionately, "I believe you want them to
surrender.I should rather see Clarence dead than giving his sword to a
Yankee."At that the other two were silent again, and sat on through an endless
afternoon of uncertainty and hope and dread in the darkened room.Catherwood's heavy step was heard as he paced the hall.From time to time they glanced at Virginia, as if to fathom her
thought.She and Puss Russell had come that day to dine with Maude.Catherwood's Ben, reeking of the stable, had brought the rumor of the
marching on the camp into the dining-room, and close upon the heels of
this the rumble of the drums and the passing of Sigel's regiment.It was
Virginia who had the presence of mind to slam the blinds in the faces of
the troops, and the crowd had cheered her.It was Virginia who flew to
the piano to play Dixie ere they could get by, to the awe and admiration
of the girls and the delight of Mr.Catherwood who applauded her spirit
despite the trouble which weighed upon him.Once more the crowd had
cheered,--and hesitated.But the Dutch regiment slouched on, impassive,
and the people followed.Virginia remained at the piano, her mood exalted patriotism, uplifted
in spirit by that grand song.At first she had played it with all her
might.She laughed in very scorn of the booby soldiers
she had seen.A million of these, with all the firearms in the world,
could not prevail against the flower of the South.Then she had begun
whimsically to sing a verse of a song she had heard the week before, and
suddenly her exaltation was fled, and her fingers left the keys.Gaining
the window, trembling, half-expectant, she flung open a blind.The troops, the people, were gone, and there alone in the road
stood--Stephen Brice.The others close behind her saw him, too, and Puss
cried out in her surprise.The impression, when the room was dark once
more, was of sternness and sadness,--and of strength.Effaced was the
picture of the plodding recruits with their coarse and ill-fitting
uniforms of blue.Not a word escaped her, nor could they tell
why--they did not dare to question her then.An hour passed, perhaps
two, before the shrill voice of a boy was heard in the street below.They heard the patter of his bare feet on the pavement, and the cry
repeated.Bitter before, now was she on fire.Close her lips as tightly as she might, the tears forced themselves to
her eyes.How hard it is for us of this age to understand that feeling.The girls gathered around her, pale and frightened and anxious.Suddenly
courage returned to her, the courage which made Spartans of Southern
women.Catherwood was on the sidewalk,
talking to a breathless man.Barbo, Colonel Carvel's
book-keeper."Yes," he was saying, "they--they surrendered.There was nothing else
for them to do.Catherwood from a kind of stupor."Virginia, we shall make them smart for this yet, My God!"he cried,
"what have I done that my son should be a traitor, in arms against his
own brother fighting for his people?To think that a Catherwood should
be with the Yankees!You, Ben," he shouted, suddenly perceiving an
object for his anger."What do you mean by coming out of the yard?By
G-d, I'll have you whipped.I'll show you <DW65>s whether you're to be
free or not."Catherwood was a good man, who treated his servants well.Suddenly he dropped Virginia's hand and ran westward down the hill.Well
that she could not see beyond the second rise.Let us stand on the little mound at
the northeast of it, on the Olive Street Road, whence Captain Lyon's
artillery commands it.Davis Avenue is
no longer a fashionable promenade, flashing with bright dresses.Those
quiet men in blue, who are standing beside the arms of the state troops,
stacked and surrendered, are United States regulars.They have been in
Kansas, and are used to scenes of this sort.The five Hessian regiments have surrounded the camp.Each commander
has obeyed the master mind of his chief, who has calculated the time
of marching with precision.Here, at the western gate, Colonel Blair's
regiment is in open order.See the prisoners taking their places between
the ranks, some smiling, as if to say all is not over yet; some with
heads hung down, in sulky shame.Still others, who are true to the
Union, openly relieved.But who is this officer breaking his sword to
bits against the fence, rather than surrender it to a Yankee?Listen to
the crowd as they cheer him.Listen to the epithets and vile names which
they hurl at the stolid blue line of the victors, "Mudsills!""<DW64>
Worshippers."Yes, the crowd is there, seething with conflicting passions.Men with
brows bent and fists clenched, yelling excitedly.Others pushing, and
eager to see,--there in curiosity only.And, alas, women and children
by the score, as if what they looked upon were not war, but a parade,
a spectacle.As the gray uniforms file out of the gate, the crowd has
become a mob, now flowing back into the fields on each side of the road,
now pressing forward vindictively until stopped by the sergeants and
corporals.Listen to them calling to sons, and brothers, and husbands in
gray!See, there is a woman who spits in a soldier's face!Throughout it all, the officers sit their horses, unmoved.A man on the
bank above draws a pistol and aims at a captain.A German private steps
from the ranks, forgetful of discipline, and points at the man, who is
cursing the captain's name.The captain, imperturbable, orders his man
back to his place.Now are the prisoners of that regiment all in place between the two
files of it.A band (one of those which played lightsome music on the
birthday of the camp) is marched around to the head of the column.The
regiment with its freight moves on to make place for a battalion of
regulars, amid imprecations and cries of "Hurrah for Jeff Davis!"Stephen Brice stood among the people in Lindell's Grove, looking up at
the troops on the road, which was on an embankment.Through the rows of
faces he had searched in vain for one.His motive he did not attempt
to fathom--in truth, he was not conscious at the time of any motive.He
heard the name shouted at the gate."Here they are,--the dragoons!Dismounted, at the head of his
small following, the young Captain walked erect.He did not seem to hear
the cheers.His face was set, and he held his gloved hand over the place
where his sword had been, as if over a wound.On his features, in his
attitude, was stamped the undying determination of the South.How those
thoroughbreds of the Cavaliers showed it!The
fire of humiliation burned, but could not destroy their indomitable
spirit.They were the first of their people in the field, and the last
to leave it.Historians may say that the classes of the South caused the
war; they cannot say that they did not take upon themselves the greatest
burden of the suffering.Twice that day was the future revealed to Stephen.Once as he stood
on the hill-crest, when he had seen a girl in crimson and white in
a window,--in her face.And now again he read it in the face of her
cousin.It was as if he had seen unrolled the years of suffering that
were to come.In that moment of deep bitterness his reason wavered.Surely there was no such feeling in the North as these
people betrayed.That most dangerous of gifts, the seeing of two
sides of a quarrel, had been given him.He
sympathized with the Southern people.They had befriended him in his
poverty.Why had he not been born, like Clarence Colfax, the owner of a
large plantation, the believer in the divine right of his race to rule?Would that his path had been as
straight, his duty as easy, as that of the handsome young Captain.Presently these thoughts were distracted by the sight of a back
strangely familiar.The back belonged to a gentleman who was
energetically climbing the embankment in front of him, on the top
of which Major Sexton, a regular, army officer, sat his horse.The
gentleman was pulling a small boy after him by one hand, and held a
newspaper tightly rolled in the other.Stephen smiled to himself when it
came over him that this gentleman was none other than that Mr.William
T. Sherman he had met in the street car the day before.Somehow Stephen
was fascinated by the decision and energy of Mr.He gave Major Saxton a salute, quick and genial.Then, almost
with one motion he unrolled the newspaper, pointed to a paragraph, and
handed it to the officer.Major Saxton was still reading when a drunken
ruffian clambered up the bank behind them and attempted to pass through
the lines.Sherman slid down the
bank with his boy into the grove beside Stephen.A corporal pitched the drunkard backwards over the bank, and
he rolled at Mr.With a curse, he picked himself up,
fumbling in his pocket.There was a flash, and as the smoke rolled from
before his eyes, Stephen saw a man of a German regiment stagger and
fall.It was the signal for a rattle of shots.Stones and bricks filled the
air, and were heard striking steel and flesh in the ranks.The regiment
quivered,--then halted at the loud command of the officers, and the
ranks faced out with level guns, Stephen reached for Mr.Sherman's boy,
but a gentleman had already thrown him and was covering his body.He contrived to throw down a woman standing beside him before the
mini-balls swished over their heads, and the leaves and branches began
to fall.Between the popping of the shots sounded the shrieks of wounded
women and children, the groans and curses of men, and the stampeding of
hundreds.He was about to obey when a young; man, small and agile, ran past him
from behind, heedless of the panic.Stopping at the foot of the bank he
dropped on one knee, resting his revolver in the hollow of his left
arm.At the same time two of the soldiers above
lowered their barrels to cover him.When it
rolled away, Brinsmade lay on the ground.He staggered to his feet with
an oath, and confronted a young man who was hatless, and upon whose
forehead was burned a black powder mark.he cried, reaching out wildly, "curse you, you d--d Yankee.Maddened, he made a rush at Stephen's throat.But Stephen seized his
hands and bent them down, and held them firmly while he kicked and
struggled.he panted; "curse you, you let me go and I'll kill
you,--you Yankee upstart!"One of the
officers, seeing the struggle, started down the bank, was reviled, and
hesitated."Let him go, Brice," he said, in a tone of command.Whereupon Brinsmade made a dash for his pistol on the ground."Now see here, Jack," he said, picking it up, "I don't want to shoot
you, but I may have to.That young man saved your life at the risk of
his own.If that fool Dutchman had had a ball in his gun instead of a
wad, Mr.Brinsmade took one long look at Stephen,
turned on his heel, and walked off rapidly through the grove.And it may
be added that for some years after he was not seen in St.For a moment the other two stood staring after him.Sherman
took his boy by the hand.Brice," he said, "I've seen a few things done in my life, but
nothing better than this.Perhaps the day may come when you and I may
meet in the army.They don't seem to think much of us now," he added,
smiling, "but we may be of use to 'em later.If ever I can serve you,
Mr.Brice, I beg you to call on me."Sherman, nodding his head
vigorously, went away southward through the grove, toward Market Street.The dead were being laid in carriages, and the
wounded tended by such physicians as chanced to be on the spot.Stephen,
dazed at what had happened, took up the march to town.He strode faster
than the regiments with their load of prisoners, and presently he found
himself abreast the little file of dragoons who were guarded by some of
Blair's men.It was then that he discovered that the prisoners' band in
front was playing "Dixie."They are climbing the second hill, and are coming now to the fringe
of new residences which the rich citizens have built.In the windows and on the steps of others women are
crying or waving handkerchiefs and calling out to the prisoners, some
of whom are gay, and others sullen.A distracted father tries to break
through the ranks and rescue his son.Ah, here is the Catherwood house.Catherwood, with her hand on her husband's arm, with
red eyes, is scanning those faces for the sight of George.Will the Yankees murder him for treason,
or send him North to languish the rest of his life?James has,
across the street, and is even now being carried into the house.Few
of us can see into the hearts of those women that day, and speak of the
suffering there.His face is cast down as
he passes the house from which he is banished.Nor do father, or mother,
or sister in their agony make any sound or sign.The
welcome and the mourning and the tears are all for him.The band is playing "Dixie" once more.George is coming, and some one
else.The girls are standing in a knot bend the old people, dry-eyed,
their handkerchiefs in their hands.Some of the prisoners take off their
hats and smile at the young lady with the chiselled features and brown
hair, who wears the red and white of the South as if she were born to
them.Ah, at last she sees him, walking erect
at the head of his dragoons.He gives her one look of entreaty, and that
smile which should have won her heart long ago.As if by common consent
the heads of the troopers are uncovered before her.How bravely she
waves at them until they are gone down the street!Then only do her eyes
fill with tears, and she passes into the house.Had she waited, she might have seen a solitary figure leaving the line
of march and striding across to Pine Street.That night the sluices of the heavens were opened, and the blood was
washed from the grass in Lindell Grove.The rain descended in floods
on the distracted city, and the great river rose and flung brush from
Minnesota forests high up on the stones of the levee.Down in the long
barracks weary recruits, who had stood and marched all the day long,
went supperless to their hard pallets.Many a boy, prisoner or volunteer, sobbed
himself to sleep in the darkness.All were prisoners alike, prisoners
of war.Sobbed themselves to sleep, to dream of the dear homes that were
here within sight and sound of them, and to which they were powerless to
go.Sisters, and mothers, and wives were there, beyond the rain, holding
out arms to them.But what of
the long nights when husband and wife have lain side by side?What of
the children who ask piteously where their father is going, and who are
gathered by a sobbing mother to her breast?Where is the picture of that
last breakfast at home?So in the midst of the cheer which is saddest in
life comes the thought that, just one year ago, he who is the staff
of the house was wont to sit down just so merrily to his morning meal,
before going to work in the office.Why had they not thanked God on
their knees for peace while they had it?See the brave little wife waiting on the porch of her home for him to go
by.The sun shines, and the grass is green on the little plot, and the
geraniums red.Last spring she was sewing here with a song on her lips,
watching for him to turn the corner as he came back to dinner.Her good
neighbors, the doctor and his wife, come in at the little gate to cheer
her.Why does God mock her with sunlight and
with friends?And that is his dear face, the second from the end.Look, he is smiling bravely, as if to say a thousand
tender things."Will, are the flannels in your knapsack?You have not
forgotten that medicine for your cough?"What courage sublime is that
which lets her wave at him?Well for you, little woman, that you cannot
see the faces of the good doctor and his wife behind you.Oh, those guns
of Sumter, how they roar in your head!Ay, and will roar again, through
forty years of widowhood!Brice was in the little parlor that Friday night, listening to the
cry of the rain outside.Why
should she be happy, and other mothers miserable?The day of reckoning
for her happiness must surely come, when she must kiss Stephen a brave
farewell and give him to his country.For the sins of the fathers are
visited on the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate Him who is the Ruler of all things.The bell rang, and Stephen went to the door.That gentleman was suddenly aged, and his clothes were wet
and spattered with mud.He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits
and water which Mrs."Stephen," he said, "I have been searching the city for John.Did you
see him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?""I think not, sir," Stephen answered, with clear eyes."I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.""If you will excuse me,
madam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter.I have been able to
find no one who saw him."As he went out he glanced at Stephen's forehead.But for once in his
life, Mr.Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of
another."Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John," said his mother, when
the door was closed.IN THE ARSENAL

There was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel's house in Locust Street that
evening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a
pretence of eating.Addison Colfax had driven in
from Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash
the foam from her panting horses.She did not wait for Jackson to come
out with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage
to the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and
demand Clarence's release.Carvel assured her
it would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter
that claimed him.Could there be a more important matter than his
own nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch
butchers in the frenzy of their victory?Colfax shut herself up in
her room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down
to tea.The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness.With his hat on his head,
and his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room.He let his
cigar go out,--a more serious sign still.Finally he stood with his face
to the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown
of white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of
the state.Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her
father's back.If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for
that portrait.There was a light in her dark blue eyes.Underneath there
were traces of the day's fatigue.When she spoke, there was little life
in her voice."Aren't you going to the Planters' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and
tried to smile."I reckon not to-night, Jinny."To find out what they are going to do with Clarence," she said
indignantly."I reckon they don't know at the Planters' House," he said."Then--" began Virginia, and stopped."Then why not go to the Barracks?Order the carriage, and I will go with
you."He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes
his habit."Jinny," he said slowly, "Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?"The suddenness of the question took her breath.But she answered
steadily:

"Yes."Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father's gaze pierced to
her secret soul."Come here, my dear," he said.He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them.It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles
against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge.From
childhood she had been comforted there.Had she broken her doll, had
Mammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she
ill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman's inevitable
lot,--this was her sanctuary.This burden God Himself had sent,
and none save her Heavenly Father might cure it.Through his great love
for her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.Many times he strove to speak, and could not.But presently, as if
ashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on
the arm of his chair.By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well.What
he had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one."You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may
fail us.Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be.Our trade was
in the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay.Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be
prepared.""And did you think I would care, dear?""I can bear
with poverty and rags, to win this war.""His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them.Jackson came in on
tiptoe, and hesitated.At the Colonel's motion he took away the china
and the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights
in the chandelier.He went out softly, and closed the door."Pa," said Virginia, presently, "do you trust Mr.He improved the business greatly before this trouble
came.And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.""Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as
he serves himself."I think you do him an injustice, my dear," answered the Colonel.But
uneasiness was in his voice."Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a
cent.He owns two slaves now who are running the river.He keeps out of
politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults."Getting up, he went over to the
bell-cord at the door and pulled it."To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor.He smiled, and stooped to kiss her."Yes," he answered, "in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust
you, Jinny.And Lige's boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or
Sunday."The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly.A long line of boats lay idle,
with noses to the levee.Men stood on the street corners in the rain,
reading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands
lifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street.A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread.The Dutch had broken
up the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent
women and children.What might they not do to the defenceless city under
their victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South?Ladies who ventured out that day
crossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress.Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt's room.Three times
she knocked, and then she heard a cry within.Then the key was turned
and the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed
her aunt."Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!""I thought it was the
Dutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?""We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian," was the joyful answer."The
newspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free
to-day, on parole.Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them.The
whole state would have risen to their rescue."Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports.She permitted
her niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the
mirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there."I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long.I
am afraid I am going to have another of my attacks."I'll get it for you," said Virginia, used to her aunt's vagaries."It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a
comfortable night.""It must be a Yankee lie," said the lady.I saw them
torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians!I know he had to sleep
on a dirty floor with low-down trash.""But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!""Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr."Has he gone down to see
Clarence?""He went to Jefferson City last night," replied Virginia.Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news."Do you mean that he has deserted us?""That he has left us
here defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their
vengeance upon us women?If I were your
age and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal
now.I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even
if he is a Yankee.""I do not go on my knees to any man," she said."Rosetta, tell Ned I
wish the carriage at once."Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm."Your Pa would never forgive
me if anything happened to you."A smile, half pity, crossed the girl's anxious face."I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,"
she said, and left the room.His was one of the Union houses which
she might visit and not lose her self respect.Like many Southerners,
when it became a question of go or stay, Mr.Brinsmade's unfaltering
love for the Union had kept him in.Bell, and later
had presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings.In short, as a man of
peace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace.And now
that it was to be war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with
the Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could
not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy.He never hurt their
feelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work
which has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief
of suffering.He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and
many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and
Rebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of
perplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own
leaders.Brinsmade's own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that
gentleman himself standing on the threshold.He came down his steps
bareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as
he led her into the house.However such men may try to hide their own
trials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a
kindred nature.With the others, who are less generous, it matters
not.Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not
perceive that a trouble had come to this good man.Absorbed as she was
in her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence.The fire
left her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of
an enemy.Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the
drawing-room.From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw
her arms around her friend."Jinny, it was so good of you to come."Because we are Union," said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of
doubt."Anne," she cried, "if you were German, I believe
I should love you."I should not have dared go to your house,
because I know that you feel so deeply."That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think.Perhaps," she cried,
"perhaps he may be dead."She drew Anne to the sofa and
kissed her."No, he is not dead," she said gently, but with a confidence in her
voice of rare quality."He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have
heard."Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr.He
looked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those
whom he honored.A life of service to others had made him guess that,
in the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some
kind."Virginia is right, Anne," he said."John has gone to fight for his
principles, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember
that this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because
we think differently.""There is
something I can do for you, my dear?"And yet her honesty was as
great as Anne's.She would not have it thought that she came for other
reasons."My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came
to ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be
paroled.She thinks it is a--" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious
tongue.Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made.He
understood the girl, and admired her."I'll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny," he answered."I know
Captain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.""You will do nothing of the kind, sir," said Virginia, with emphasis."Had I known this--about John, I should not have come."What a gentleman of the old school
he was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye
kindling with charity."My dear," he answered, "Nicodemus is waiting.I was just going myself
to ask Captain Lyon about John."Virginia's further objections were cut
short by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a
tall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as
Major Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street
Railroad.He then proceeded, as was
evidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.Brinsmade," he said, "I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that
you were seeking news of your son.I regret to say, sir, that the news I
have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts.But in justice to
a young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened
at Camp Jackson."With
some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story,
he gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr.John's arrival at the
embankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union
volunteers.Sherman did not believe in
mincing matters even to a father and sister."And, sir," said he, "you may thank the young man who lives next door to
you--Mr.Brice, I believe--for saving your son's life."Virginia felt Anne's hand tighten But her own was limp.A hot wave swept
over her, Was she never to hear the end of this man."Yes, sir, Stephen Brice," answered Mr."And I never in my life
saw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.""As sure as I know you," said the Major, with excessive conviction.Brinsmade, "I was in there last night, I knew the young
man had been at the camp.He told me
that he had, by the embankment.But he never mentioned a word about
saving his life.""By glory, but he's even better than I
thought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?""Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.""Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to
put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr.Brice, who was only
ten feet away, standing before your son."Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted.Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the
story.The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well.Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and
had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the
regiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how
Stephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.Had she any right to treat
such a man with contempt?She remembered hour he had looked, at her when
he stood on the corner by the Catherwoods' house.And, worst of all, she
remembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of
which had been that Mr.Brice was better at preaching than at fighting.She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the
greatest injustice she could have done him.It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major.Sherman,
apparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had
he not interfered.John would have
shot the man who saved his life.Brinsmade and Anne had
gone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told
Virginia, who kept it in her heart.The reason he told her was because
she had guessed a part of it.Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday,
in his own carriage.Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to
him to talk cheerily with her.He told her many little anecdotes of his
travel, but not one of them did she hear.Again, at the moment when she
thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she
found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter
young Bostonian.In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen's
deed was splendid.Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy.But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would
Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr.Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr.As if to aggravate her torture, Mr.Brinsmade's talk drifted to the
subject of young Mr.He told her of the
brave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and
often necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.Brinsmade, "often I have been unable to sleep, and
have seen the light in Stephen's room until the small hours of the
morning.""Can't you tell me something bad
about him?The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his
side, flushed and confused.Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what
he thought?How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after
they have caned us for them?We do not remember that our parents have
once been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings
a part of their past vividly before them.Brinsmade was silent, but
he looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia.And presently,
as they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of
gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city.Nicodemus stopped
at his master's signal.Here was George Catherwood, and his father was
with him."They have released us on parole," said George."Yes, we had a fearful
night of it.They could not have kept us--they had no quarters."How changed he was from the gay trooper of yesterday!His bright uniform
was creased and soiled and muddy, his face unshaven, and dark rings of
weariness under his eyes."Do you know if Clarence Colfax has gone home?""Clarence is an idiot," cried George, ill-naturedly.Brinsmade, of
all the prisoners here, he refused to take the parole, or the oath of
allegiance.He swears he will remain a prisoner until he is exchanged.""The young man is Quixotic," declared the elder Catherwood, who was not
himself in the best of humors.Brinsmade, with as much severity as he was ever known
to use, "sir, I honor that young man for this more than I can tell you.Nicodemus, you may drive on."Perhaps George had caught sight of a face in the depths of the carriage,
for he turned purple, and stood staring on the pavement after his
choleric parent had gone on.Of all the thousand and more young men who had upheld
the honor of their state that week, there was but the one who chose to
remain in durance vile within the Arsenal wall--Captain Clarence Colfax,
late of the Dragoons.Brinsmade was rapidly admitted to the Arsenal, and treated with the
respect which his long service to the city deserved.He and Virginia
were shown into the bare military room of the commanding officer, and
thither presently came Captain Lyon himself.Virginia tingled with
antagonism when she saw this man who had made the city tremble, who had
set an iron heel on the flaming brand of her Cause.He, too, showed the
marks of his Herculean labors, but only on his clothes and person.His
long red hair was unbrushed, his boots covered with black mud, and his
coat unbuttoned.His face was ruddy, and his eye as clear as though
he had arisen from twelve hours' sleep.He bowed to Virginia (not too
politely, to be sure).Her own nod of are recognition did not seem to
trouble him."Yes, sir," he said incisively, in response to Mr.Brinsmade's question,
"we are forced to retain Captain Colfax.He prefers to remain a prisoner
until he is exchanged.He refuses to take the oath of allegiance to the
United States."And why should he be made to, Captain Lyon?In what way has he opposed
the United States troops?""You will pardon me, Miss Carvel," said Captain Lyon, gravely, "if I
refuse to discuss that question with you."Colfax is a near relative of yours, Miss Carvel,"
the Captain continued."His friends may come here to see him during
the day.And I believe it is not out of place for me to express my
admiration of the captain's conduct.You may care to see him now--"

"Thank you," said Virginia, curtly."Orderly, my respects to Captain Colfax, and ask him if a he will be
kind enough to come in here.Brinsmade," said the Captain, "I
should like a few words with you, sir."And so, thanks to the Captain's
delicacy, when Clarence arrived he found Virginia alone.She was much
agitated She ran toward him as he entered the door, calling his name."Max, you are going to stay here?"Aglow with admiration, she threw herself into his arms.Now, indeed, was
she proud of him.Of all the thousand defenders of the state, he alone
was true to his principles--to the South.Within sight of home, he alone
had chosen privation.She looked up into his face, which showed marks of excitement and
fatigue.She knew that he could live on
excitement.The thought came to her--was it that which sustained him
now?Surely the touch of this experience
would transform the boy into the man.This was the weak point in the
armor which she wore so bravely for her cousin.He had known neither care nor
responsibility.His one longing from a child had been that love of
fighting and adventure which is born in the race.Until this gloomy
day in the Arsenal, Virginia had never characterized it as a love of
excitement---as any thing which contained a selfish element.She looked
up into his face, I say, and saw that which it is given to a woman only
to see.His eyes burned with a light that was far away.Even with his
arms around her he seemed to have forgotten her presence, and that she
had come all the way to the Arsenal to see him.Her hands dropped limply
from his shoulders She drew away, as he did not seem to notice.Above and beyond the sacrifice of a woman's life, the
joy of possessing her soul and affection, is something more desirable
still--fame and glory--personal fame and glory, The woman may share
them, of course, and be content with the radiance.When the Governor
in making his inauguration speech, does he always think of the help the
little wife has given him.And so, in moments of excitement, when we see
far ahead into a glorious future, we do not feel the arms about us,
or value the sweets which, in more humdrum days, we labored so hard to
attain.Virginia drew away, and the one searching glance she gave him he did
not see.He was staring far beyond; tears started in her eyes, and she
turned from him to look out over the Arsenal grounds, still wet and
heavy with the night's storm.She
thought of the supper cooking at home.And yet, in that moment of bitterness Virginia loved him.Such are the
ways of women, even of the proudest, who love their country too.It was
but right that he should not think of her when the honor of the South
was at stake; and the anger that rose within her was against those nine
hundred and ninety-nine who had weakly accepted the parole."He has gone to Jefferson City, to see the Governor.."

"And you came alone?"What a relief that should have come
among the first.She was
afraid," (Virginia had to smile), "she was afraid the Yankees would kill
you.""They have behaved very well for Yankees," replied he, "No luxury, and
they will not hear of my having a servant.They are used to doing their
own work.But they have treated me much better since I refused to take
their abominable oath.""And you will be honored for it when the news reaches town."Clarence asked eagerly, "I reckon they will
think me a fool!""I should like to hear any one say so," she flashed out."No," said Virginia, "our friends will force them to release you.But you have done nothing to be imprisoned
for.""I do not want to be
released.""You do not want to be released," she repeated.If I remain a prisoner, it will
have a greater effect--for the South."She smiled again, this time at the boyish touch of heroics.Experience,
responsibility, and he would get over that.She remembered once, long
ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and
he had tortured her by remaining there for two whole days.It was well on in the afternoon when she drove back to the city with Mr.Neither of them had eaten since morning, nor had they even
thought of hunger.Brinsmade was silent, leaning back in the corner
of the carriage, and Virginia absorbed in her own thoughts.Drawing near
the city, that dreaded sound, the rumble of drums, roused them.A shot
rang out, and they were jerked violently by the starting of the horses.As they dashed across Walnut at Seventh came the fusillade.Down the vista of the street was a mass of
blue uniforms, and a film of white smoke hanging about the columns of
the old Presbyterian Church Mr.Brinsmade quietly drew her back into the
carriage.The shots ceased, giving place to an angry roar that struck terror to
her heart that wet and lowering afternoon.Nicodemus tugging at the reins, and great splotches of
mud flying in at the windows.The roar of the crowd died to an ominous
moaning behind them.Brinsmade was speaking:--
"From battle and murder, and from sudden death--from all sedition, privy
conspiracy, and rebellion,--Good Lord, deliver us."He was repeating the Litany--that Litany which had come down through the
ages.They had chanted it in Cromwell's time, when homes were ruined and
laid waste, and innocents slaughtered.They had chanted it on the dark,
barricaded stairways of mediaeval Paris, through St.Bartholomew's
night, when the narrow and twisted streets, ran with blood.They had
chanted it in ancient India, and now it was heard again in the New World
and the New Republic of Peace and Good Will.The girl flinched at the word which the good gentleman had
uttered in his prayers.Was she a traitor to that flag for which her
people had fought in three wars?She burned to blot it
forever from the book Oh, the bitterness of that day, which was prophecy
of the bitterness to come.Brinsmade escorted her up her own steps.He held her hand a little at parting, and bade her be of good cheer.Perhaps he guessed something of the trial she was to go through that
night alone with her aunt, Clarence's mother.Brinsmade did not go
directly home.He went first to the little house next door to his.Brice and Judge Whipple were in the parlor: What passed between them
there has not been told, but presently the Judge and Mr.Brinsmade came
out together and stood along time in, the yard, conversing, heedless of
the rain.THE STAMPEDE

Sunday dawned, and the people flocked to the churches.But even in the
house of God were dissension and strife.Posthelwaite's Virginia saw men and women rise from their knees and
walk out--their faces pale with anger.Mark's the prayer for
the President of the United States was omitted.Catherwood nodded approvingly over the sermon in which the South was
justified, and the sanction of Holy Writ laid upon her Institution.With not indifferent elation these gentlemen watched the departure of
brethren with whom they had labored for many years, save only when Mr.Brinsmade walked down the aisle never to return.So it is that war, like
a devastating flood, creeps insistent into the most sacred places, and
will not be denied.Davitt, at least, preached that day to an united
congregation,--which is to say that none of them went out.Hopper,
who now shared a pew with Miss Crane, listened as usual with a most
reverent attention.The clouds were low and the streets wet as people
walked home to dinner, to discuss, many in passion and some in sorrow,
the doings of the morning.A certain clergyman had prayed to be
delivered from the Irish, the Dutch, and the Devil.Was it he who
started the old rumor which made such havoc that afternoon?Those
barbarians of the foreign city to the south, drunk with power, were to
sack and loot the city.How it flew across street and alley, from
yard to yard, and from house to house!Privileged Ned ran into the
dining-room where Virginia and her aunt were sitting, his eyes rolling
and his face ashen with terror, crying out that the Dutch were marching
on the city, firebrands in hand and murder in their hearts."De Gen'ral done gib out er procl'mation, Miss Jinny," he cried."De
Gen'ral done say in dat procl'mation dat he ain't got no control ober de
Dutch soldiers.""Oh Miss Jinny, ain't you gwineter Glencoe?Ain't you gwineter flee
away?Every fambly on dis here street's gwine away--is packin' up fo' de
country.Doan't you hear 'em, Miss Jinny?What'll your pa say to Ned of
he ain't make you clear out!Doan't you hear de carridges a-rattlin' off
to de country?"Virginia rose in agitation, yet trying to be calm, and to remember
that the safety of the household depended upon her alone.That was her
thought,--bred into her by generations,--the safety of the household,
of the humblest slave whose happiness and welfare depended upon her
father's bounty.How she longed in that instant for her father or
Captain Lige, for some man's strength, to depend upon.She has seen her aunt swoon before,
and her maid Susan knows well what to do."Laws Mussy, no, Miss Jinny.One <DW65> laik me doan't make no
difference.My Marsa he say: 'Whaffor you leave ma house to be ramsacked
by de Dutch?'Oh Miss Jinny, you an' Miss Lill an' Mammy
Easter an' Susan's gwine with Jackson, an' de othah niggahs can walk.Ephum an' me'll jes' put up de shutters an' load de Colonel's gun."By this time the room was filled with excited <DW64>s, some crying,
and some laughing hysterically.Uncle Ben had come in from the kitchen;
Jackson was there, and the women were a wailing bunch in the corner by
the sideboard.Old Ephum, impassive, and Ned stood together.Virginia's
eye rested upon them, and the light of love and affection was in it.Yes, carriages were indeed rattling outside, though
a sharp shower was falling.Across the street Alphonse, M. Renault's
butler, was depositing bags and bundles on the steps.M. Renault himself
bustled out into the rain, gesticulating excitedly.Spying her at the
window, he put his hands to his mouth, cried out something, and ran in
again.Virginia flung open the sash and listened for the dreaded sound
of drums.Then she crossed quickly over to where her aunt was lying on
the lounge."O Jinny," murmured that lady, who had revived, "can't you do something?They will be here any moment to burn us, to
murder us--to--oh, my poor boy!Why isn't he here to protect his mother!Why was Comyn so senseless, so thoughtless, as to leave us at such a
time!""I don't think there is any need to be frightened," said Virginia, with
a calmness that made her aunt tremble with anger."It is probably only a
rumor.Brinsmade's and ask him about it."However loath to go, Ned departed at once.All honor to those old-time
<DW64>s who are now memories, whose devotion to their masters was next
to their love of God.A great fear was in Ned's heart, but he went.And he believed devoutly that he would never see his young mistress any
more.Colfax is summoning
that courage which comes to persons of her character at such times.She
gathers her jewels into a bag, and her fine dresses into her trunk,
with trembling hands, although she is well enough now.The picture of
Clarence in the diamond frame she puts inside the waist of her gown.No,
she will not go to Bellegarde.With frantic
haste she closes the trunk, which Ephum and Jackson carry downstairs and
place between the seats of the carriage.Ned had had the horses in it
since church time.It is three in the afternoon, and Jackson explains that,
with the load, they would not reach there until midnight, if at all.Yes; many of the first families live there,
and would take them in for the night.Equipages of all sorts are
passing,--private carriages and public, and corner-stand hacks.The
black drivers are cracking whips over galloping horses.Pedestrians are hurrying by with bundles under their arms, some running
east, and some west, and some stopping to discuss excitedly the chances
of each direction.From the river comes the hoarse whistle of the boats
breaking the Sabbath stillness there.Virginia leaned against the iron railing of the steps, watching the
scene, and waiting for Ned to return from Mr.Her face was
troubled, as well it might be.The most alarming reports were cried up
to her from the street, and she looked every moment for the black smoke
of destruction to appear to the southward.Around her were gathered the
Carvel servants, most of them crying, and imploring her not to leave
them.Colfax's trunk was brought down and placed in the
carriage where three of them might have ridden to safety, a groan of
despair and entreaty rose from the faithful group that went to her
heart."Miss Jinny, you ain't gwineter leave yo' ol mammy?""Hush, Mammy," she said."No, you shall all go, if I have to stay
myself.Ephum, go to the livery stable and get another carriage."She went up into her own deserted room to gather the few things she
would take with her--the little jewellery case with the necklace of
pearls which her great-grandmother had worn at her wedding.Rosetta and
Mammy Easter were of no use, and she had sent them downstairs again.With a flutter she opened her wardrobe door, to take one last look at
the gowns there.They were part of happier days
gone by.She fell down on her knees and opened the great drawer at the
bottom, and there on the top lay the dainty gown which had belonged
to Dorothy Manners.A tear fell upon one of the flowers of the stays.Irresistibly pressed into her mind the memory of Anne's fancy dress
ball,--of the episode by the gate, upon which she had thought so often
with burning face.The voices below grow louder, but she does not hear.She is folding the
gown hurriedly into a little package.It was her great-grandmother's;
her chief heirloom after the pearls.Silk and satin from Paris are
left behind.With one glance at the bed in which she had slept since
childhood, and at the picture over it which had been her mother's, she
hurries downstairs.And Dorothy Manners's gown is under her arm.On the
landing she stops to brush her eyes with her handkerchief.Ned simply pointed out a young man standing on the
steps behind the <DW64>s.Crimson stains were on Virginia's cheeks,
and the package she carried under her arm was like lead.The young
man, although he showed no signs of excitement, reddened too as he came
forward and took off his hat.But the sight of him had acurious effect
upon Virginia, of which she was at first unconscious.A sense of
security came upon her as she looked at his face and listened to his
voice.Brinsmade has gone to the hospital, Miss Carvel," he said.Brinsmade asked me to come here with your man in the hope that I might
persuade you to stay where you are.""Then the Germans are not moving on the city?"It was that smile that angered her,
that made her rebel against the advice he had to offer; that made her
forget the insult he had risked at her hands by coming there.For she
believed him utterly, without reservation.The moment he had spoken she
was convinced that the panic was a silly scare which would be food for
merriment in future years.And yet--was not that smile in derision of
herself--of her friends who were running away?Was it not an assumption
of Northern superiority, to be resented?"It is only a malicious rumor, Miss Carvel," he answered."You have
been told so upon good authority, I suppose," she said dryly.And at the
change in her tone she saw his face fall."I have not," he replied honestly, "but I will submit it to your own
judgment.Yesterday General Harney superseded Captain Lyon in command
in St.Some citizens of prominence begged the General to send the
troops away, to avoid further ill-feeling and perhaps--bloodshed."(They
both winced at the word.)"Colonel Blair represented to the General that
the troops could not be sent away, as they had been enlisted to serve
only in St.Louis; whereupon the General in his proclamation states that
he has no control over these Home Guards.That sentence has been twisted
by some rascal into a confession that the Home Guards are not to be
controlled.I can assure you, Miss Carvel," added Stephen, speaking
with a force which made her start and thrill, "I can assure you from a
personal knowledge of the German troops that they are not a riotous lot,
and that they are under perfect control.If they were not, there are
enough regulars in the city to repress them."And she was silent, forgetful of the hub-bub around her.It
was then that her aunt called out to her, with distressing shrillness,
from the carriage:-- "Jinny, Jinny, how can you stand there talking to
young men when our lives are in danger?"She glanced hurriedly at Stephen, who said gently; "I do not wish to
delay you, Miss Carvel, if you are bent upon going."His tone was not resentful, simply quiet.Ephum turned the
corner of the street, the perspiration running on his black face."Miss Jinny, dey ain't no carridges to be had in this town.This was the occasion for another groan from the <DW64>s, and they began
once more to beseech her not to leave them.In the midst of their cries
she heard her aunt calling from the carriage, where, beside the trunk,
there was just room for her to squeeze in."Jinny," cried that lady, frantically, "are you to go or stay?The
Hessians will be here at any moment.Oh, I cannot stay here to be
murdered!"Unconsciously the girl glanced again at Stephen.He had not gone, but
was still standing in the rain on the steps, the one figure of strength
and coolness she had seen this afternoon.Distracted, she blamed the
fate which had made this man an enemy.How willingly would she have
leaned upon such as he, and submitted to his guidance.Unluckily at
that moment came down the street a group which had been ludicrous on any
other day, and was, in truth, ludicrous to Stephen then.At the head
of it was a little gentleman with red mutton-chop whiskers, hatless, in
spite of the rain beginning to fall.His face was the very caricature of
terror.His clothes, usually neat, were awry, and his arms were full
of various things, not the least conspicuous of which was a magnificent
bronze clock.It was this object that caught Virginia's eye.But years
passed before she laughed over it.Cluyme (for it was he)
trotted his family.Cluyme, in a pink wrapper, carried an armful
of the family silver; then came Belle with certain articles of feminine
apparel which need not be enumerated, and the three small Cluymes of
various ages brought up the rear.Cluyme, at the top of his speed, was come opposite to the carriage
when the lady occupant got out of it.Clutching at his sleeve, she
demanded where he was going.His wife coming after
him had a narrower escape still.Colfax retained a handful of lace
from the wrapper, the owner of which emitted a shriek of fright."Virginia, I am going to the river," said Mrs."No, indeedy, Miss Lilly, I ain't a-gwine 'thout
young Miss.The Dutch kin cotch me an' hang me, but I ain't a-gwine
'thout Miss Jinny."Colfax drew her shawl about her shoulders with dignity."Ill as I am, I shall walk.Bear
witness that I have spent a precious hour trying to save you.If I live
to see your father again, I shall tell him that you preferred to stay
here and carry on disgracefully with a Yankee, that you let your own
aunt risk her life alone in the rain.She did not run down the steps, but she caught
her aunt by the arm ere that lady had taken six paces.The girl's face
frightened Mrs.Colfax into submission, and she let herself be led back
into the carriage beside the trunk.Colfax's stung
Stephen to righteous anger and resentment--for Virginia.As to himself, he had looked for insult.He turned to go that he might
not look upon her confusion; and hanging on the resolution, swung on his
heel again, his eyes blazeing.He saw in hers the deep blue light of
the skies after an evening's storm.She was calm, and save for a little
quiver of the voice, mistress of herself as she spoke to the group of
cowering servants."Mammy," she said, "get up on the box with Ned.And, Ned, walk the
horses to the levee, so that the rest may follow.Ephum, you stay here
with the house, and I will send Ned back to keep you company."With these words, clasping tightly the precious little bundle under her
arm, she stepped into the carriage.Heedless of the risk he ran, sheer
admiration sent Stephen to the carriage door."If I can be of any service, Miss Carvel," he said, "I shall be happy."And as the horses slipped and started she slammed the door in his face.Down on the levee wheels rattled over the white stones washed clean by
the driving rain.The drops pelted the chocolate water into froth, and a
blue veil hid the distant bluffs beyond the Illinois bottom-lands.Down
on the Levee rich and poor battled for places on the landing-stages, and
would have thrown themselves into the flood had there been no boats
to save them from the dreaded Dutch.Attila and his Huns were not
more feared.What might not its
Barbarians do when roused?The rich and poor struggled together; but
money was a power that day, and many were pitilessly turned off because
they did not have the high price to carry them--who knew where?Boats which screamed, and boats which had a dragon's roar were backing
out of the close ranks where they had stood wheel-house to wheel-house,
and were dodging and bumping in the channel.See, their guards are black
with people!Colfax, when they are come out of the narrow street
into the great open space, remarks this with alarm.All the boats will
be gone before they can get near one.She
is thinking of other things than the steamboats, and wondering whether
it had not been preferable to be killed by Hessians.Vance, is
a friend of the family.What a mighty contempt did Ned and his kind have
for foot passengers!Laying about him with his whip, and shouting at the
top of his voice to make himself heard, he sent the Colonel's Kentucky
bays through the crowd down to the Barbara's landing stage, the people
scampering to the right and left, and the Carvel servants, headed by
Uncle Ben, hanging on to the carriage springs, trailing behind.He will tell you to this day how
Mr.Catherwood's carriage was pocketed by drays and bales, and how Mrs.James's horses were seized by the bridles and turned back.Ned had a
head on his shoulders, and eyes in his head.He spied Captain Vance
himself on the stage, and bade Uncle Ben hold to the horses while he
shouldered his way to that gentleman.The result was that the Captain
came bowing to the carriage door, and offered his own cabin to the
ladies.But the <DW65>s---he would take no <DW65>s except a maid for
each; and he begged Mrs.Colfax's pardon--he could not carry her trunk.So Virginia chose Mammy Easter, whose red and yellow turban was awry
from fear lest she be left behind and Ned was instructed to drive the
rest with all haste to Bellegarde.Colfax his
arm, and Virginia his eyes.He escorted the ladies to quarters in the
texas, and presently was heard swearing prodigiously as the boat was
cast off.It was said of him that he could turn an oath better than any
man on the river, which was no mean reputation.Colfax was assisted to bed by Susan.Virginia stood by the little
window of the cabin, and as the Barbara paddled and floated down the
river she looked anxiously for signals of a conflagration.Nay, in that
hour she wished that the city might burn.So it is that the best of us
may at times desire misery to thousands that our own malice may be
fed.Virginia longed to see the yellow flame creep along the wet,
gray clouds.Passionate tears came to her eyes at the thought of the
humiliation she had suffered,--and before him, of all men.Could she
ever live with her aunt after what she had said?"Carrying on with that
Yankee!"Her anger, too, was still against Stephen.Once more he had been sent by
circumstances to mock her and her people.If the city would only burn,
that his cocksure judgment might for once be mistaken, his calmness for
once broken!The rain ceased, the clouds parted, and the sun turned the muddy river
to gold.The bluffs shone May-green in the western flood of light, and a
haze hung over the bottom-lands.Not a sound disturbed the quiet of
the city receding to the northward, and the rain had washed the pall
of smoke from over it.On the boat excited voices died down to natural
tones; men smoked on the guards and promenaded on the hurricane deck,
as if this were some pleasant excursion.Women waved to the other boats
flocking after.Colfax stirred in
her berth and began to talk.Virginia did not move

"Jinny!"In that hour she remembered that great good-natured man, her
mother's brother, and for his sake Colonel Carvel had put up with much
from his wife's sister in-law.She could pass over, but never forgive
what her aunt had said to her that afternoon.Colfax had often been
cruel before, and inconsiderate.But as the girl thought of the speech,
staring out on the waters, it suddenly occurred to her that no lady
would have uttered it.In all her life she had never realized till now
that her aunt was not a lady.From that time forth Virginia's attitude
toward her aunt was changed.She controlled herself, however, and answered something, and went out
listlessly to find the Captain and inquire the destination of the boat.At the foot of the companionway
leading to the saloon deck she saw, of all people, Mr.Eliphalet Hopper
leaning on the rail, and pensively expectorating on the roof of the
wheel-house.In another mood Virginia would have laughed, for at sight
of her he straightened convulsively, thrust his quid into his cheek, and
removed his hat with more zeal than the grudging deference he usually
accorded to the sex.Clearly Eliphalet would not have chosen the
situation."I cal'late we didn't get out any too soon, Miss Carvel," he remarked,
with a sad attempt at jocoseness."There won't be a great deal in that
town when the Dutch get through with it.""I think that there are enough men left in it to save it," said
Virginia.Hopper found no suitable answer to this, for he made
none.He continued to glance at her uneasily.There was an impudent
tribute in his look which she resented strongly."He's down below--ma'am," he replied."Yes," she said, with abrupt maliciousness, "you may tell me where you
are going.""I cal'late, up the Cumberland River.That's where she's bound for,
if she don't stop before she gets there Guess there ain't many of 'em
inquired where she was goin', or cared much," he added, with a ghastly
effort to be genial."I didn't see any use in gettin' murdered, when I couldn't do anything."He stared after her up the companionway, bit off a
generous piece of tobacco, and ruminated.If to be a genius is to
possess an infinite stock of patience, Mr.But it was not a pleasant smile to look upon.She had told her aunt the news, and stood
in the breeze on the hurricane deck looking southward, with her hand
shading her eyes.The 'Barbara Lane' happened to be a boat with a
record, and her name was often in the papers.She had already caught up
with and distanced others which had had half an hour's start of her, and
was near the head of the procession.Virginia presently became aware that people were gathering around her in
knots, gazing at a boat coming toward them.Others had been met which,
on learning the dread news, turned back.But this one kept her bow
steadily up the current, although she had passed within a biscuit-toss
of the leader of the line of refugees.It was then that Captain Vance's
hairy head appeared above the deck.he said, "if here ain't pig-headed Brent, steaming the
'Jewanita' straight to destruction.""Oh, are you sure it's Captain Brent?""If that there was Shreve's old Enterprise come to life again, I'd lay
cotton to sawdust that Brent had her.Danged if he wouldn't take her
right into the jaws of the Dutch."The Captain's words spread, and caused considerable excitement.On board
the Barbara Lane were many gentlemen who had begun to be shamefaced over
their panic, and these went in a body to the Captain and asked him to
communicate with the 'Juanita'.Whereupon a certain number of whistles
were sounded, and the Barbara's bows headed for the other side of the
channel.As the Juanita drew near, Virginia saw the square figure and clean,
smooth-shaven face of Captain Lige standing in front of his wheel-house
Peace crept back into her soul, and she tingled with joy as the bells
clanged and the bucket-planks churned, and the great New Orleans packet
crept slowly to the Barbara's side."You ain't goin' in, Brent?"At the sound of his voice Virginia could
have wept."The Dutch are sacking the city," said Vance.A general titter went along the guards, and Virginia blushed."I'm on my reg'lar trip, of course," said Vance.Out there on the sunlit
river the situation seemed to call for an apology."Seems to be a little more loaded than common," remarked Captain Lige,
dryly, at which there was another general laugh."If you're really goin' up," said Captain Vance, "I reckon there's a few
here would like to be massacred, if you'll take 'em."Brent; "I'm bound for the barbecue."While the two great boats were manoeuvring, and slashing with one wheel
and the other, the gongs sounding, Virginia ran into the cabin."Oh, Aunt Lillian," she exclaimed, "here is Captain Lige and the
Juanita, and he is going to take us back with him.It its unnecessary here to repeat the moral persuasion which Virginia
used to get her aunt up and dressed.That lady, when she had heard the
whistle and the gongs, had let her imagination loose.Turning her face
to the wall, she was in the act of repeating her prayers as her niece
entered.A big stevedore carried her down two decks to where the gang-plank
was thrown across.Captain Lige himself was at the other end.His face
lighted, Pushing the people aside, he rushed across, snatched the lady
from the <DW64>'s arms, crying:

"Jinny!The stevedore's
services were required for Mammy Easter.And behind the burly shield
thus formed, a stoutish gentleman slipped over, all unnoticed, with a
carpet-bag in his hand It bore the initials E. H.

The plank was drawn in.The great wheels began to turn and hiss, the
Barbara's passengers waved good-by to the foolhardy lunatics who had
elected to go back into the jaws of destruction.Colfax was put
into a cabin; and Virginia, in a glow, climbed with Captain Lige to the
hurricane deck.There they stood for a while in silence, watching the
broad stern of the Barbara growing smaller."Just to think," Miss Carvel
remarked, with a little hysterical sigh, "just to think that some of
those people brought bronze clocks instead of tooth-brushes.""And what did you bring, my girl?"asked the Captain, glancing at the
parcel she held so tightly under her arm.He never knew why she blushed so furiously.THE STRAINING OF ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP

Captain Lige asked but two questions: where was the Colonel, and was
it true that Clarence had refused to be paroled?Though not possessing
over-fine susceptibilities, the Captain knew a mud-drum from a lady's
watch, as he himself said.In his solicitude for Virginia, he saw that
she was in no state of mind to talk of the occurrences of the last few
days.So he helped her to climb the little stair that winds to the top
of the texas,--that sanctified roof where the pilot-house squats.The
girl clung to her bonnet Will you like her any the less when you know
that it was a shovel bonnet, with long red ribbons that tied under
her chin?"Captain Lige," she said, almost
tearfully, as she took his arm, "how I thank heaven that you came up the
river this afternoon!""Jinny," said the Captain, "did you ever know why cabins are called
staterooms?""Why, no," answered she, puzzled."There was an old fellow named Shreve who ran steamboats before Jackson
fought the redcoats at New Orleans.In Shreve's time the cabins were
curtained off, just like these new-fangled sleeping-car berths.The old
man built wooden rooms, and he named them after the different states,
Kentuck, and Illinois, and Pennsylvania.So that when a fellow came
aboard he'd say: 'What state am I in, Cap?'And from this river has the
name spread all over the world--stateroom.That's mighty interesting,"
said Captain Lige."Yea," said Virginia; "why didn't you tell me long ago.""And I'll bet you can't say," the Captain continued, "why this house
we're standing on is called the texas.""Because it is annexed to the states," she replied, quick a flash."Well, you're bright," said he."Old Tufts got that notion, when Texas
came in.Bill Jenks was Captain Brent's senior pilot.His skin hung on his face
in folds, like that of a rhinoceros It was very much the same color.His
grizzled hair was all lengths, like a worn-out mop; his hand reminded
one of an eagle's claw, and his teeth were a pine yellow.He greeted
only such people as he deemed worthy of notice, but he had held Virginia
in his arms."William," said the young lady, roguishly, "how is the eye, location,
and memory?"When this happened it was put in
the Juanita's log."So the Cap'n be still harpin' on that?"he said, "Miss Jinny, he's just
plumb crazy on a pilot's qualifications.""He says that you are the best pilot on the river, but I don't believe
it," said Virginia.He made a place for her on the leather-padded
seat at the back of the pilot house, where for a long time she sat
staring at the flag trembling on the jackstaff between the great sombre
pipes.The sun fell down, but his light lingered in the air above as the
big boat forged abreast the foreign city of South St.There
was the arsenal--grim despite its dress of green, where Clarence was
confined alone.Captain Lige came in from his duties below."Well, Jinny, we'll soon be
at home," he said."We've made a quick trip against the rains.""And--and do you think the city is safe?""Jinny, would
you like to blow the whistle?""I should just love to," said Virginia.Jenks's
directions she put her toe on the tread, and shrank back when the
monster responded with a snort and a roar.River men along the levee
heard that signal and laughed.The joke was certainly not on sturdy
Elijah Brent.An hour later, Virginia and her aunt and the Captain, followed by Mammy
aster and Rosetta and Susan, were walking through the streets of the
stillest city in the Union.All that they met was a provost's guard, for
St.Once in a while they saw the light of
some contemptuous citizen of the residence district who had stayed to
laugh.Out in the suburbs, at the country houses of the first families,
people of distinction slept five and six in a room--many with only a
quilt between body and matting.Little wonder that these dreamed of
Hessians and destruction.In town they slept with their doors open,
those who remained and had faith.Martial law means passes and
explanations, and walking generally in the light of day.Martial law
means that the Commander-in-chief, if he be an artist in well doing,
may use his boot freely on politicians bland or beetle-browed.No police
force ever gave the sense of security inspired by a provost's guard.Captain Lige sat on the steps of Colonel Carvel's house that night, long
after the ladies were gone to bed.The only sounds breaking the silence
of the city were the beat of the feet of the marching squads and the
call of the corporal's relief.But the Captain smoked in agony until the
clouds of two days slipped away from under the stars, for he was trying
to decide a Question.Then he went up to a room in the house which had
been known as his since the rafters were put down on that floor.The next morning, as the Captain and Virginia sit at breakfast together
with only Mammy Easter to cook and Rosetta to wait on them, the Colonel
bursts in.He is dusty and travel-stained from his night on the train,
but his gray eyes light with affection as he sees his friend beside his
daughter."Jinny," he cries as he kisses her, "Jinny, I'm proud oil you, my girl!You didn't let the Yankees frighten you--But where is Jackson?"And so the whole miserable tale has to be told over again, between
laughter and tears on Virginia's part, and laughter and strong language
on Colonel Carvel's.What--blessing that Lige met them, else the
Colonel might now be starting for the Cumberland River in search of his
daughter.The Captain does not take much part in the conversation, and
he refuses the cigar which is offered him."Lige," he says, "this is the first time to my knowledge.""I smoked too many last night," says the Captain.The Colonel sat down,
with his feet against the mantel, too full of affairs to take much
notice of Mr."The Yanks have taken the first trick--that's sure," he said."But I
think we'll laugh last, Jinny.The
state has got more militia, or will have more militia in a day or
two.We won't miss the thousand they stole in Camp Jackson.And I've got a few commissions right here," and he
tapped his pocket."Pa," said Virginia, "did you volunteer?""The Governor wouldn't have me," he answered."He said I was more good
here in St.The Colonel listened with
many exclamations, slapping his knee from time to time as she proceeded.he cried, when she had finished, "the boy has it in him, after
all!They can't hold him a day--can they, Lige?"(No answer from the
Captain, who is eating his breakfast in silence.)"All that we have to
do is to go for Worington and get a habeas corpus from the United States
District Court.The Captain got up excitedly, his face
purple."I reckon you'll have to excuse me, Colonel," he said."There's a cargo
on my boat which has got to come off."And without more ado he left the
room.In consternation they heard the front door close behind him.And
yet, neither father nor daughter dared in that hour add to the trial
of the other by speaking out the dread that was in their hearts.The
Colonel smoked for a while, not a word escaping him, and then he patted
Virginia's cheek."I reckon I'll run over and see Russell, Jinny," he said, striving to
be cheerful.He stopped
abruptly in the hall and pressed his hand to his forehead."My God," he
whispered to himself, "if I could only go to Silas!"Colfax's lawyer, of whose politics it is not necessary to speak.There
was plenty of excitement around the Government building where his Honor
issued the writ.There lacked not gentlemen of influence who went with
Mr.Russell and Colonel Carvel and the lawyer and the Commissioner to
the Arsenal.They were admitted to the presence of the indomitable Lyon,
who informed them that Captain Colfax was a prisoner of war, and, since
the arsenal was Government property, not in the state.The Commissioner
thereupon attested the affidavit to Colonel Carvel, and thus the
application for the writ was made legal.These things the Colonel reported to Virginia; and to Mrs.Colfax, who
received them with red eyes and a thousand queries as to whether that
Yankee ruffian would pay any attention to the Sovereign law which he
pretended to uphold; whether the Marshal would not be cast over the
Arsenal wall by the slack of his raiment when he went to serve the writ.This was not the language, but the purport, of the lady's questions.Colonel Carvel had made but a light breakfast: he had had no dinner,
and little rest on the train.But he answered his sister-in-law with
unfailing courtesy.He was too honest to express a hope which he did not
feel.He had returned that evening to a dreary household.During the
day the servants had straggled in from Bellegarde, and Virginia had had
prepared those dishes which her father loved.Colfax chose to keep
her room, for which the two were silently thankful.The Colonel was humming a tune as he went down the stairs, but
Virginia was not deceived.He would not see the yearning in her eyes as
he took his chair; he would not glance at Captain Lige's empty seat.She caught her breath when she saw that the
food on his plate lay untouched.He pushed his chair away, such suffering in his look as she had never
seen."Jinny," he said, "I reckon Lige is for the Yankees.""I have known it all along," she said, but faintly."My God," cried the Colonel, in agony, "to think that he kept it from me
I to think that Lige kept it from me!""It is because he loves you, Pa," answered the girl, gently, "it is
because he loves us."Virginia got up, and went softly around the
table."Yes," he said, his voice lifeless.But her courage was not to be lightly shaken."Pa, will you forbid him
to come here--now?"A long while she waited for his answer, while the big clock ticked out
the slow seconds in the hall, and her heart beat wildly."As long as I have a roof, Lige may come under
it."She did not ask him where he was
going, but ordered Jackson to keep the supper warm, and went into the
drawing-room.The lights were out, then, but the great piano that was
her mother's lay open.That wondrous
hymn which Judge Whipple loved, which for years has been the comfort
of those in distress, floated softly with the night air out of the
open window.Colonel Carvel heard it, and
paused.He did not stop again until he reached the narrow street at the top
of the levee bank, where the quaint stone houses of the old French
residents were being loaded with wares.He took a few steps back-up the
hill.Then he wheeled about, walked swiftly down the levee, and on to
the landing-stage beside which the big 'Juanita' loomed in the night.On
her bows was set, fantastically, a yellow street-car.Its unexpected appearance there had
served to break the current of his meditations.He stood staring at it,
while the roustabouts passed and repassed, noisily carrying great logs
of wood on shoulders padded by their woollen caps."That'll be the first street-car used in the city of New Orleans, if it
ever gets there, Colonel.""Reckon I'll have to stay here and boss the cargo all night.Want to
get in as many trips as I can before--navigation closes," the Captain
concluded significantly."You were never too busy to come for
supper, Lige.Captain Lige shot at him a swift look."Come over here on the levee," said the Colonel, sternly.They walked
out together, and for some distance in silence."Lige," said the elder gentleman, striking his stick on the stones, "if
there ever was a straight goer, that's you.You've always dealt squarely
with me, and now I'm going to ask you a plain question."I'm North, I reckon," answered the Captain, bluntly.It was a long time before he spoke again.The Captain waited
like a man who expects and deserve, the severest verdict."And you wouldn't tell me, Lige?"My God, Colonel," exclaimed the other, passionately, "how could I?I
owe what I have to your charity.But for you and--and Jinny I should
have gone to the devil.If you and she are taken away, what have I left
in life?I was a coward, sir, not to tell you.And yet,--God help me,--I can't stand by and see the nation go to
pieces.Your fathers fought that
we Americans might inherit the earth--" He stopped abruptly.Then he
continued haltingly, "Colonel, I know you're a man of strong feelings
and convictions.All I ask is that you and Jinny will think of me as a
friend--"

He choked, and turned away, not heeding the direction of his feet.The
Colonel, his stick raised, stood looking after him.He was folded in the
near darkness before he called his name.He came back, wondering, across the rough stones until he stood beside
the tall figure.Below them, the lights glided along the dark water."Lige, didn't I raise you?Haven't I taught you that my house was your
home?But--but never speak to me again of this night!Not a word passed between them as they went up the quiet street.At the
sound of their feet in the entry the door was flung open, and Virginia,
with her hands out stretched, stood under the hall light."Oh, Pa, I knew you would bring him back," she said.OF CLARENCE

Captain Clarence Colfax, late of the State Dragoons, awoke on Sunday
morning the chief of the many topics of the conversation of a big city.His conduct drew forth enthusiastic praise from the gentlemen and ladies
who had thronged Beauregard and Davis avenues, and honest admiration
from the party which had broken up the camp.There were many doting parents, like Mr.Catherwood, whose boys had
accepted the parole, whose praise was a trifle lukewarm, to be sure.But popular opinion, when once aroused, will draw a grunt from the most
grudging.We are not permitted, alas, to go behind these stern walls and discover
how Captain Colfax passed that eventful Sunday of the Exodus.We know
that, in his loneliness, he hoped for a visit from his cousin, and took
to pacing his room in the afternoon, when a smarting sense of injustice
crept upon him.And how was he to guess, as he
looked out in astonishment upon the frightened flock of white boats
swimming southward, that his mother and his sweetheart were there?On Monday, while the Colonel and many prominent citizens were busying
themselves about procuring the legal writ which was at once to release
Mr.Colfax, and so cleanse the whole body of Camp Jackson's defenders
from any, veiled intentions toward the Government, many well known
carriages drew up before the Carvel House in Locust Street to
congratulate the widow and the Colonel upon the possession of such a
son and nephew.There were some who slyly congratulated Virginia, whose
martyrdom it was to sit up with people all the day long.Colfax
kept her room, and admitted only a few of her bosom friends to cry with
her.When the last of the callers was gone, Virginia was admitted to her
aunt's presence."Aunt Lillian, to-morrow morning Pa and I are going to the Arsenal with
a basket for Max.Pa seems to think there is a chance that he may come
back with us.The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, and raised her hands in
protest, the lace on the sleeves of her dressing gown falling away from
her white arms.she exclaimed, "when I can't walk to my bureau after that
terrible Sunday.No," she added, with conviction,
"I never again expect to see him alive.Comyn says they may release him,
does he?The girl went away, not in anger or impatience, but in sadness.Brought
up to reverence her elders, she had ignored the shallowness of her
aunt's character in happier days.Colfax's conduct carried
a prophecy with it.Virginia sat down on the landing to ponder on the
years to come,--on the pain they were likely to bring with them from
this source--Clarence gone to the war; her father gone (for she felt
that he would go in the end), Virginia foresaw the lonely days of trial
in company with this vain woman whom accident made her cousin's mother.Ay, and more, fate had made her the mother of the man she was to marry.The girl could scarcely bear the thought--through the hurry and swing of
the events of two days she had kept it from her mind.To-morrow he would be coming home
to her joyfully for his reward, and she did not love him.She was bound
to face that again and again.She had cheated herself again and again
with other feelings.She had set up intense love of country in the
shrine where it did not belong, and it had answered--for a while.She
saw Clarence in a hero's light--until a fatal intimate knowledge made
her shudder and draw back.Captain Lige's cheery voice roused her from below--and her father's
laugh.And as she went down to them she thanked God that this friend had
been spared to him.Never had the Captain's river yarns been better told
than at the table that evening.Virginia did not see him glance at the
Colonel when at last he had brought a smile to her face."I'm going to leave Jinny with you, Lige," said Mr."Worington has some notion that the Marshal may go to the Arsenal
to-night with the writ.she pleaded

The Colonel was taken aback.He stood looking down at her, stroking his
goatee, and marvelling at the ways of woman."The horses have been out all day, Jinny," he said, "I am going in the
cars.""I can go in the cars, too.""There is only a chance that we shall see Clarence," he went on,
uneasily."It is better than sitting still," cried Virginia, as she ran away to
get the bonnet with the red strings."Lige,--" said the Colonel, as the two stood awaiting her in the hall,
"I can't make her out.It was a long journey, in a bumping car with had springs that rattled
unceasingly, past the string of provost guards.The Colonel sat in the
corner, with his head bent down over his stick At length, cramped and
weary, they got out, and made their way along the Arsenal wall, past the
sentries to the entrance.The sergeant brought his rifle to a "port".Carver

"Captain Colfax was taken to Illinois in a skiff, quarter of an hour
since."Captain Lige gave vent to a long, low whistle.he exclaimed, "and the river this high!Before he could answer came the noise of steps from the direction of
the river, and a number of people hurried up excitedly.Worington, the lawyer, and caught him by the sleeve.Worington glanced at the sentry, and pulled the Colonel past the
entrance and into the street."They have started across with him in a light skiff----four men and a
captain.And a lot of us, who suspected
what they were up to, were standing around.When we saw 'em come down,
we made a rush and had the guard overpowered But Colfax called out to
stand back.""Cuss me if I understand him," said Mr."He told us to
disperse, and that he proposed to remain a prisoner and go where they
sent him."Then--"Move on please, gentlemen," said the sentry,
and they started to walk toward the car line, the lawyer and the Colonel
together.Virginia put her hand through the Captain's arm.In the
darkness he laid his big one over it."Don't you be frightened, Jinny, at what I said, I reckon they'll fetch
up in Illinois all right, if I know Lyon.There, there," said Captain
Lige, soothingly.She had endured more in
the past few days than often falls to the lot of one-and-twenty.He thought of the
many, many times he had taken her on his knee and kissed her tears.He
might do that no more, now.There was the young Captain, a prisoner on
the great black river, who had a better right, Elijah Brent wondered, as
they waited in the silent street for the lonely car, if Clarence loved
her as well as he.It was vary late when they reached home, and Virginia went silently up
to her room.Colonel Carvel stared grimly after her, then glanced at his
friend as he turned down the lights.The eyes of the two met, as of old,
in true understanding.The sun was still slanting over the tops of the houses the next morning
when Virginia, a ghostly figure, crept down the stairs and withdrew
the lock and bolt on the front door.The street was still, save for
the twittering of birds and the distant rumble of a cart in its early
rounds.The chill air of the morning made her shiver as she scanned the
entry for the newspaper.Dismayed, she turned to the clock in the hall.She sat long behind the curtains in her father's little library, the
thoughts whirling in her brain as she watched the growing life of
another day.Once she stole softly back to
the entry, self-indulgent and ashamed, to rehearse again the bitter and
the sweet of that scene of the Sunday before.She summoned up the image
of the young man who had stood on these steps in front of the frightened
servants.She seemed to feel again the calm power and earnestness of his
face, to hear again the clear-cut tones of his voice as he advised
her.Then she drew back, frightened, into the sombre library,
conscience-stricken that she should have yielded to this temptation
then, when Clarence--She dared not follow the thought, but she saw the
light skiff at the mercy of the angry river and the dark night.If he were spared, she prayed for strength to
consecrate herself to him A book lay on the table, and Virginia took
refuge in it.And her eyes glancing over the pages, rested on this
verse:--

       "Thy voice is heard thro' rolling drums,
        That beat to battle where he stands;
        Thy face across his fancy comes,
        And gives the battle to his hands."The paper brought no news, nor mentioned the ruse to which Captain Lyon
had resorted to elude the writ by transporting his prisoner to Illinois.Newspapers were not as alert then as now.Colonel Carvel was off early
to the Arsenal in search of tidings.He would not hear of Virginia's
going with him.Captain Lige, with a surer instinct, went to the river.Twice Virginia was summoned to her aunt, and
twice she made excuse.It was the Captain who returned first, and she
met him at the door."He is alive," said the Captain, tremulously, "alive and well, and
escaped South."She took a step toward him, and swayed.For a
brief instant he held her in his arms and then he led her to the great
armchair that was the Colonel's."Lige," she said, "--are you sure that this is not--a kindness?""No, Jinny," he answered quickly, "but things were mighty close.They struck out straight
across, but they drifted and drifted like log-wood.And then she began
to fill, and all five of 'em to bail.The
five soldiers came up on that bit of an island below the Arsenal.They
hunted all night, but they didn't find Clarence.And they got taken off
to the Arsenal this morning.""I knew that much this morning," he continued, "and so did your pa.But
the Andrew Jackson is just in from Memphis, and the Captain tells me
that he spoke the Memphis packet off Cape Girardeau, and that Clarence
was aboard.She picked him up by a miracle, after he had just missed a
round trip through her wheel-house."CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING A CAPITALIST

A cordon of blue regiments surrounded the city at first from Carondelet
to North St.The crowds liked best to go to
Compton Heights, where the tents of the German citizen-soldiers were
spread out like so many slices of white cake on the green beside the
city's reservoir.Thence the eye stretched across the town, catching the
dome of the Court House and the spire of St.Away to the west,
on the line of the Pacific railroad that led halfway across the state,
was another camp.Then another, and another, on the circle of the fan,
until the river was reached to the northward, far above the bend.Within
was a peace that passed understanding,--the peace of martial law.Without the city, in the great state beyond, an irate governor had
gathered his forces from the east and from the west.Letters came and
went between Jefferson City and Jefferson Davis, their purport being
that the Governor was to work out his own salvation, for a while
at least.Louis, struck in a night by the fever of
militarism, arose and went to Glencoe.Prying sergeants and commissioned
officers, mostly of hated German extraction, thundered at the door
of Colonel Carvel's house, and other houses, there--for Glencoe was
a border town.They searched the place more than once from garret to
cellar, muttered guttural oaths, and smelled of beer and sauerkraut, The
haughty appearance of Miss Carvel did not awe them--they were blind
to all manly sensations.The Colonel's house, alas, was one of many in
Glencoe written down in red ink in a book at headquarters as a place
toward which the feet of the young men strayed.Good evidence was
handed in time and time again that the young men had come and gone, and
red-faced commanding officers cursed indignant subalterns, and implied
that Beauty had had a hand in it.Councils of war were held over the
advisability of seizing Mr.Sandra went back to the bathroom.Carvel's house at Glencoe, but proof was
lacking until one rainy night in June a captain and ten men spurred up
the drive and swung into a big circle around the house.The Captain
took off his cavalry gauntlet and knocked at the door, more gently than
usual.The Captain was given an
audience more formal than one with the queen of Prussia could have been,
Miss Carvel was infinitely more haughty than her Majesty.Was not the
Captain hired to do a degrading service?Indeed, he thought so as he
followed her about the house and he felt like the lowest of criminals
as he opened a closet door or looked under a bed.He was a beast of the
field, of the mire.How Virginia shrank from him if he had occasion to
pass her!Her gown would have been defiled by his touch.And yet the
Captain did not smell of beer, nor of sauerkraut; nor did he swear in
any language.He did his duty apologetically, but he did it.He pulled
a man (aged seventeen) out from under a great hoop skirt in a little
closet, and the man had a pistol that refused its duty when snapped in
the Captain's face.This was little Spencer Catherwood, just home from a
military academy.Spencer was taken through the rain by the chagrined Captain to the
headquarters, where he caused a little embarrassment.No damning
evidence was discovered on his person, for the pistol had long since
ceased to be a firearm.And so after a stiff lecture from the Colonel
he was finally given back into the custody of his father.Despite the
pickets, the young men filtered through daily,--or rather nightly.Presently some of them began to come back, gaunt and worn and tattered,
among the grim cargoes that were landed by the thousands and tens of
thousands on the levee.And they took them (oh, the pity of it!)Lynch's slave pen, turned into a Union prison of
detention, where their fathers and grandfathers had been wont to send
their disorderly and insubordinate <DW65>s.They were packed away, as
the miserable slaves had been, to taste something of the bitterness
of the <DW64>'s lot.So came Bert Russell to welter in a low room whose
walls gave out the stench of years.How you cooked for them, and schemed
for them, and cried for them, you devoted women of the South!You spent
the long hot summer in town, and every day you went with your baskets
to Gratiot Street, where the infected old house stands, until--until one
morning a lady walked out past the guard, and down the street.She was
civilly detained at the corner, because she wore army boots.If you were a young lady of the proper principles
in those days, you climbed a steep pair of stairs in the heat, and stood
in line until it became your turn to be catechised by an indifferent
young officer in blue who sat behind a table and smoked a horrid cigar.He had little time to be courteous.He was not to be dazzled by a bright
gown or a pretty face; he was indifferent to a smile which would have
won a savage.His duty was to look down into your heart, and extract
therefrom the nefarious scheme you had made to set free the man you
loved ere he could be sent north to Alton or Columbus.My dear, you
wish to rescue him, to disguise him, send him south by way of Colonel
Carvel's house at Glencoe.At least, he will
have died for the South.First politics, and then war, and then more politics, in this our
country.Your masterful politician obtains a regiment, and goes to war,
sword in hand.He fights well, but he is still the politician.It
was not a case merely of fighting for the Union, but first of getting
permission to fight.Camp Jackson taken, and the prisoners exchanged
south, Captain Lyon; who moved like a whirlwind, who loved the Union
beyond his own life, was thrust down again.A mutual agreement was
entered into between the Governor and the old Indian fighter in command
of the Western Department, to respect each other.How Lyon chafed, and paced the Arsenal walks while he might have
saved the state.Then two gentlemen went to Washington, and the next
thing that happened was Brigadier General Lyon, Commander of the
Department of the West.Would General Lyon confer with the Governor of Missouri?Yes, the
General would give the Governor a safe-conduct into St.Louis, but
his Excellency must come to the General.His Excellency came, and the
General deigned to go with the Union leader to the Planters House.Conference, five hours; result, a safe-conduct for the Governor back.And this is how General Lyon ended the talk.His words, generously
preserved by a Confederate colonel who accompanied his Excellency,
deserve to be writ in gold on the National Annals."Rather than concede to the state of Missouri the right to demand that
my Government shall not enlist troops within her limits, or bring troops
into the state whenever it pleases; or move its troops at its own will
into, out of, or through, the state; rather than concede to the state of
Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my Government in
any matter, however unimportant, I would" (rising and pointing in turn
to every one in the room) "see you, and you, and you, and you, and every
man, woman, and child in this state, dead and buried."Then, turning
to the Governor, he continued, "This means war.In an hour one of my
officers will call for you and conduct you out of my lines."And thus, without another word, without an inclination of the head, he
turned upon his heel and strode out of the room, rattling his spurs and
clanking his sabre.In less than two months that indomitable leader was
lying dead beside Wilson's Creek, among the oaks on Bloody Hill.What he
would have been to this Union, had God spared him, we shall never know.He saved Missouri, and won respect and love from the brave men who
fought against him.What prayers rose to heaven,
and curses sank to hell, when the news of them came to the city by
the river!Flags were made by loving fingers, and shirts and bandages.Trembling young ladies of Union sympathies presented colors to regiments
on the Arsenal Green, or at Jefferson Barracks, or at Camp Benton to the
northwest near the Fair Grounds.And then the regiments marched through
the streets with bands playing that march to which the words of the
Battle Hymn were set, and those bright ensigns snapping at the front;
bright now, and new, and crimson.But soon to be stained a darker red,
and rent into tatters, and finally brought back and talked over and
cried over, and tenderly laid above an inscription in a glass case, to
be revered by generations of Americans to confer What can stir the
soul more than the sight of those old flags, standing in ranks like
the veterans they are, whose duty has been nobly done?The blood of the
color-sergeant is there, black now with age.But where are the tears of
the sad women who stitched the red and the white and the blue together?The regiments marched through the streets and aboard the boats, and
pushed off before a levee of waving handkerchiefs and nags.Later--much later, black headlines, and grim
lists three columns long,--three columns of a blanket sheet!"The City
of Alton has arrived with the following Union dead and wounded, and
the following Confederate wounded (prisoners)."In a never-ceasing procession they steamed up the river; those calm
boats which had been wont to carry the white cargoes of Commerce now
bearing the red cargoes of war.And they bore away to new battlefields
thousands of fresh-faced boys from Wisconsin and Michigan and Minnesota,
gathered at Camp Benton.Some came back with their color gone and their
red cheeks sallow and bearded and sunken.Stephen Brice, with a pain over his heart and a lump in his throat,
walked on the pavement beside his old company, but his look avoided
their faces.He wrung Richter's hand on the landing-stage.The good German's eyes were filled as he said good-by."You will come, too, my friend, when the country needs you," he said."Now" (and he shrugged his shoulders), "now have we many with no cares
to go.I have not even a father--" And he turned to Judge Whipple, who
was standing by, holding out a bony hand."God bless you, Carl," said the Judge And Carl could scarce believe his
ears.He got aboard the boat, her decks already blue with troops, and as
she backed out with her whistle screaming, the last objects he saw were
the gaunt old man and the broad-shouldered young man side by side on the
edge of the landing.Stephen's chest heaved, and as he walked back to the office with the
Judge, he could not trust himself to speak.Back to the silent office
where the shelves mocked them.The Judge closed the ground-glass door
behind him, and Stephen sat until five o'clock over a book.No, it was
not Whittlesey, but Hardee's "Tactics."He shut it with a slam, and went
to Verandah Hall to drill recruits on a dusty floor,--narrow-chested
citizens in suspenders, who knew not the first motion in right about
face.For Stephen was an adjutant in the Home Guards--what was left of
them.One we know of regarded the going of the troops and the coming of the
wounded with an equanimity truly philosophical.When the regiments
passed Carvel & Company on their way riverward to embark, Mr.Hopper did
not often take the trouble to rise from his chair, nor was he ever known
to go to the door to bid them Godspeed.This was all very well, because
they were Union regiments.Hopper did not contribute a horse,
nor even a saddle-blanket, to the young men who went away secretly in
the night, without fathers or mothers or sisters to wave at them.One scorching afternoon in July Colonel Carvel came into the office,
too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his
master.The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel.Since May
he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public,
and which were so mysterious that even Mr.Hopper could not get wind
of them.These matters had taken the Colonel out of town.But now the
necessity of a pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than
Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday.Hopper rose from
his chair when Mr.Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action.Sitting down at his desk, he drummed upon it
uneasily.Eliphalet crossed the room quickly, and something that was very near a
smile was on his face.Carvel's chair with
a semi-confidential air,--one wholly new, had the Colonel given it a
thought.He did not, but began to finger some printed slips of paper
which had indorsements on their backs.His fine lips were tightly
closed, as if in pain.Hopper," he said, "these Eastern notes are due this week, are they
not?""There is no use mincing matters, Hopper.You know as well as I that
there is no money to pay them," said he, with a certain pompous attempt
at severity which characterized his kind nature.You have brought this business up to a modern footing, and made
it as prosperous as any in the town.I am sorry, sir, that those
contemptible Yankees should have forced us to the use of arms, and cut
short many promising business careers such as yours, sir.And the good gentleman looked
out of the window.He was thinking of a day, before the Mexican War,
when his young wife had sat in the very chair filled by Mr."These notes cannot be met," he repeated, and his voice was near to
breaking.The flies droning in the hot office made the only sound.Outside the
partition, among the bales, was silence.Hopper, with a remarkable ease, "I cal'late these
notes can be met."The Colonel jumped as if he had heard a shot, and one of the notes fell
to the floor.Eliphalet picked it up tenderly, and held it."There isn't a bank in town
that will lend me money.I--I haven't a friend--a friend I may ask who
can spare it, sir."Suavity was come upon
it like a new glove and changed the man.Now
he had poise, such poise as we in these days are accustomed to see in
leather and mahogany offices."I will take up those notes myself, sir."cried the Colonel, incredulously, "You?"There was not a deal of hypocrisy in his
nature, and now he did not attempt the part of Samaritan.He did not
beam upon the Colonel and remind him of the day on which, homeless and
friendless, he had been frightened into his store by a drove of mules.But his day,--the day toward which he had striven unknown and
unnoticed for so many years--the day when he would laugh at the pride of
those who had ignored and insulted him, was dawning at last.When we
are thoughtless of our words, we do not reckon with that spark in little
bosoms that may burst into flame and burn us.Not that Colonel Carvel
had ever been aught but courteous and kind to all.His station in life
had been his offence to Eliphalet, who strove now to hide an exultation
that made him tremble."I cal'late that I can gather together enough to meet the notes,
Colonel.Here followed an interval
of sheer astonishment to Mr."And you will take my note for the amount?"The Colonel pulled his goatee, and sat back in his chair, trying to face
the new light in which he saw his manager.He knew well enough that the
man was not doing this out of charity, or even gratitude.He reviewed
his whole career, from that first morning when he had carried bales to
the shipping room, to his replacement of Mr.Hood, and there was nothing
with which to accuse him.He remembered the warnings of Captain Lige
and Virginia.He could not in honor ask a cent from the Captain now.He
would not ask his sister-in-law, Mrs.Colfax, to let him touch the money
he had so ably invested for her; that little which Virginia's mother had
left the girl was sacred.Carvel had lain awake with the agony of those
Eastern debts.Not to pay was to tarnish the name of a Southern
gentleman.His house would bring nothing
in these times.He rose and began to pace the floor, tugging at his
chin.Hopper, who sat calmly on, and the
third time stopped abruptly before him."Where the devil did you get this money, sir?""I haven't been extravagant, Colonel, since I've worked for you,"
he said."It don't cost me much to live.The furrows in the Colonel's brow deepened."You offer to lend me five times more than I have ever paid you, Mr.Tell me how you have made this money before I accept it."Eliphalet had never been able to meet that eye since he had known it.But he went to his desk, and drew a long sheet of
paper from a pigeonhole."These be some of my investments," he answered, with just a tinge of
surliness."I cal'late they'll stand inspection.I ain't forcing you to
take the money, sir," he flared up, all at once."I'd like to save the
business."He went unsteadily to his desk, and none save
God knew the shock that his pride received that day.To rescue a name
which had stood untarnished since he had brought it into the world, he
drew forth some blank notes, and filled them out.But before he signed
them he spoke:

"You are a business man, Mr.Hopper," said he, "And as a business man
you must know that these notes will not legally hold.The courts are abolished, and all transactions here in St."One moment, sir," cried the Colonel, standing up and towering to his
full height."Law or no law, you shall have the money and interest, or
your security, which is this business.I need not tell you, sir, that my
word is sacred, and binding forever upon me and mine.""I'm not afraid, Colonel," answered Mr.Hopper, with a feeble attempt at
geniality.He was, in truth, awed at last."If you
were--this instant you should leave this place."He sat down, and
continued more calmly: "It will not be long before a Southern Army
marches into St."Do you reckon we can hold the business together until then,
Mr.God forbid that we should smile at the Colonel's simple faith.And if
Eliphalet Hopper had done so, his history would have ended here."Leave that to me, Colonel," he said soberly.The good Colonel sighed as he signed, away that
business which had been an honor to the city where it was founded, I
thank heaven that we are not concerned with the details of their talk
that day.Why should we wish to know the rate of interest on those
notes, or the time?Hopper filled out his check, and presently departed.It was the
signal for the little force which remained to leave.Outside, in the
store; Ephum paced uneasily, wondering why his master did not come out.Presently he crept to the door of the office, pushed it open, and beheld
Mr.Carvel with his head bowed, down in his hands."Marse Comyn, you know what I done promise young MISS long time ago,
befo'--befo' she done left us?"He saw the faithful old <DW64> but dimly.Faintly he heard the pleading
voice."Marse Comyn, won' you give Ephum a pass down, river, ter fotch Cap'n
Lige?""Ephum," said the Colonel, sadly, "I had a letter from the Captain
yesterday.His boat is a Federal transport, and he is in
Yankee pay."Ephum took a step forward, appealingly, "But de Cap'n's yo' friend,
Marse Comyn.He ain't never fo'get what you done fo' him, Marse Comyn.He ain't in de army, suh.""And I am the Captain's friend, Ephum," answered the Colonel, quietly."But I will not ask aid from any man employed by the Yankee Government.No--not from my own brother, who is in a Pennsylvania regiments."Ephum shuffled out, and his heart was lead as he closed the store that
night.Hopper has boarded a Fifth Street car, which jangles on with many
halts until it comes to Bremen, a German settlement in the north of the
city.At Bremen great droves of mules fill the street, and crowd the
entrances of the sale stables there.Whips are cracking like pistol
shots, Gentlemen with the yellow cavalry stripe of the United States
Army are pushing to and fro among the drivers and the owners, and
fingering the frightened animals.A herd breaks from the confusion
and is driven like a whirlwind down the street, dividing at the Market
House.They are going to board the Government transport--to die on the
battlefields of Kentucky and Missouri.Hopper alights from the car with complacency.He stands for a
while on a corner, against the hot building, surveying the busy scene,
unnoticed.Was it not a prophecy,--that drove which sent him into
Mr.Presently a man with a gnawed yellow mustache and a shifty eye walks out
of one of the offices, and perceives our friend.Eliphalet extends a hand to be squeezed and returned."Wal, I jest reckon," is the answer: The fellow was interrupted by the
appearance of a smart young man in a smart uniform, who wore an air of
genteel importance.He could not have been more than two and twenty, and
his face and manners were those of a clerk.The tan of field service was
lacking on his cheek, and he was black under the eyes."Hullo, Ford," he said, jocularly."Howdy, Cap," retorted the other."Wal, suh, that last lot was an extry,
fo' sure.Gov'ment
ain't cheated much on them there at one-eighty a head, I reckon."Ford said this with such an air of conviction and such a sober face
that the Captain smiled.And at the same time he glanced down nervously
at the new line of buttons on his chest."I guess I know a mule from a Newfoundland dog by this time," said he."Wal, I jest reckon," asserted Mr."Cap'n
Wentworth, allow me to make you acquainted with Mr.Hopper,
Cap'n Wentworth.""You interested in
mules, Mr."I don't cal'late to be," said.Let us hope that our worthy
has not been presented as being wholly without a sense of humor.He
grinned as he looked upon this lamb in the uniform of Mars, and added,
"I'm just naturally patriotic, I guess.Cap'n, 'll you have a drink?""It's d--d tiresome lookin' at mules all
day in the sun."Davitt that his mission work does not extend to Bremen,
that the good man's charity keeps him at the improvised hospital down
town.Hopper has resigned the superintendency of his Sunday School,
it is true, but he is still a pillar of the church.The young officer leans against the bar, and listens to stories by
Mr.Ford, which it behooves no church members to hear.And Eliphalet understands that
the good Lord put some fools into the world in order to give the smart
people a chance to practise their talents.Hopper neither drinks nor
smokes, but he uses the spittoon with more freedom in this atmosphere.When at length the Captain has marched out, with a conscious but manly
air, Mr.Hopper turns to Ford--"Don't lose no time in presenting them
vouchers at headquarters," says he.And
there's grumbling about this Department in the Eastern papers, If we
have an investigation, we'll whistle.He tosses off a pony of Bourbon, but
his face is not a delight to look upon, "Hopper, you'll be a d--d rich
man some day."And because I ain't got no capital, I only get
four per cent.""Don't one-twenty a day suit you?"And you've got horse contracts, and
blanket contracts besides.What's to prevent my goin' south
when the vouchers is cashed?""Then your mother'll have
to move out of her little place."NEWS FROM CLARENCE

The epithet aristocrat may become odious and fatal on the banks of the
Mississippi as it was on the banks of the Seine.Thousands of our population, by the
sudden stoppage of business, are thrown out of employment.When gaunt
famine intrudes upon their household, it is but natural that they should
inquire the cause.Virginia did not read this editorial, because it appeared in that
abhorred organ of the Mudsills, the 'Missouri Democrat.'The wheels of
fortune were turning rapidly that first hot summer of the war time.Let
us be thankful that our flesh and blood are incapable of the fury of
the guillotine.But when we think calmly of those days, can we escape
without a little pity for the aristocrats?Do you think that many of
them did not know hunger and want long before that cruel war was over?How bravely they met the grim spectre which crept so insidiously into
their homes!Colfax, peevishly, one morning as they
sat at breakfast, "why do you persist it wearing that old gown?It has
gotten on my nerves, my dear.You really must have something new made,
even if there are no men here to dress for.""Aunt Lillian, you must not say such things.I do not think that I ever
dressed to please men.""Tut, tut; my dear, we all do.We must not go shabby in such times as these, or be out of
fashion, Did you know that Prince Napoleon was actually coming here for
a visit this autumn?I am having a fitting at
Miss Elder's to-day."She did not reply as she poured out her
aunt's coffee."Jinny," said that lady, "come with me to Elder's, and I will give you
some gowns.If Comyn had been as careful of his own money as of mine,
you could dress decently.""I think I do dress decently, Aunt Lillian," answered the girl."I do
not need the gowns.Give me the money you intend to pay for them, and I
can use it for a better purpose."Colfax arranged her lace pettishly."I am sick and tired of this superiority, Jinny.""Hodges goes through the lines to-morrow
night."But you have no idea where
Clarence is."exclaimed her aunt, "I would not trust him.How do you know
that he will get through the Dutch pickets to Price's army?Wasn't
Souther captured last week, and that rash letter of Puss Russell's
to Jack Brinsmade published in the Democrat?"She laughed at the
recollection, and Virginia was fain to laugh too."Puss hasn't been
around much since.I hope that will cure her of saying what she thinks
of people.""I'll save my money until Price drives the Yankees from the state, and
Clarence marches into the city at the head of a regiment," Mrs.Colfax
went on, "It won't be long now.""Oh, you can't have read the papers.And don't you remember the letter
Maude had from George?They need the bare necessities of life, Aunt
Lillian.And half of Price's men have no arms at all."Colfax, "bring me a newspaper."All we know is that Lyon has left
Springfield to meet our troops, and that a great battle is coming,
Perhaps--perhaps it is being fought to-day."Colfax burst into tears, "Oh, Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so
cruel!"That very evening a man, tall and lean, but with the shrewd and kindly
eye of a scout, came into the sitting-room with the Colonel and handed
a letter to Mrs.In the hall he slipped into Virginia's hand
another, in a "Jefferson Davis" envelope, and she thrust it in her
gown--the girl was on fire as he whispered in her ear that he had seen
Clarence, and that he was well.In two days an answer might be left
at Mr.But she must be careful what she wrote, as the
Yankee scouts were active.Clarence, indeed, had proven himself a man.Glory and uniform became
him well, but danger and deprivation better.The words he had written,
careless and frank and boyish, made Virginia's heart leap with pride.Colfax's letter began with the adventure below the Arsenal, when
the frail skiff had sunk near the island, He told how he had heard the
captain of his escort sing out to him in the darkness, and how he had
floated down the current instead, until, chilled and weary, he had
contrived to seize the branches of a huge tree floating by.And how by a
miracle the moon had risen.When the great Memphis packet bore down upon
him, he had, been seen from her guards, and rescued and made much of;
and set ashore at the next landing, for fear her captain would get into
trouble.In the morning he had walked into the country, first providing
himself with butternuts and rawhide boots and a bowie-knife.Virginia
would never have recognized her dashing captain of dragoons in this
guise.The letter was long for Clarence, and written under great difficulties
from date to date.For nearly a month he had tramped over mountains
and across river bottoms, waiting for news of an organized force of
resistance in Missouri.Begging his way from cabin to cabin, and living
on greasy bacon and corn pone, at length he crossed the swift Gasconade
(so named by the French settlers because of its brawling ways) where
the bridge of the Pacific railroad had been blown up by the Governor's
orders.Then he learned that the untiring Lyon had steamed up the
Missouri and had taken possession of Jefferson City without a blow, and
that the ragged rebel force had fought and lost at Booneville.Footsore,
but undaunted, he pushed on to join the army, which he heard was
retreating southward along the western tier of counties of the state.On the banks of the Osage he fell in with two other young amen in as bad
a plight as himself.They travelled together, until one day some rough
farmers with shotguns leaped out of a bunch of willows on the borders
of a creek and arrested all three for Union spies.Clarence tried to explain that he had not long since been the dapper
captain of the State Dragoons.His Excellency, the Governor of Missouri (so acknowledged by all good
Southerners), likewise laughed when Mr.Colfax and the two others were
brought before him.His Excellency sat in a cabin surrounded by a camp
which had caused the dogs of war to howl for very shame.Louis in butternuts and
rawhide boots?""Give me a razor," demanded Clarence, with indignation, "a razor and a
suit of clothes, and I will prove it."A suit of clothes You know not what you ask."George Catherwood was
brought in,--or rather what had once been George.Now he was a big
frontiersman with a huge blond beard, and a bowie, knife stuck into
his trousers in place of a sword.He recognized his young captain of
dragoons the Governor apologized, and Clarence slept that night in the
cabin.The next day he was given a horse, and a bright new rifle which
the Governor's soldiers had taken from the Dutch at Cole Camp on the way
south, And presently they made a junction with three thousand more who
were their images.This was Price's army, but Price had gone ahead into
Kansas to beg the great McCulloch and his Confederates to come to their
aid and save the state."Dear mother, I wish that you and Jinny and Uncle Comyn could have
   seen this country rabble.How you would have laughed, and cried,
   because we are just like them.In the combined army two thousand
   have only bowie-knives or clubs.Some have long rifles of Daniel
   Boone's time, not fired for thirty years.And the impedimenta are a
   sight.Open wagons and conestogas and carryalls and buggies, and
   even barouches, weighted down with frying-pans and chairs and
   feather beds.But we've got spirit, and we can whip Lyon's Dutchmen
   and Yankees just as we are.Spirit is what counts, and the Yankees
   haven't got it, I was made to-day a Captain of Cavalry under
   Colonel Rives.I ride a great, raw-boned horse like an elephant.He jolts me until I am sore,--not quite as easy as my thoroughbred,
   Jefferson.Tell Jinny to care for him, and have him ready when we
   march into St."COWSKIN PRAIRIE, 9th July."We have whipped Sigel on the prairie by <DW53> Creek and killed--we
   don't know how many.Tell Maude that George distinguished himself
   in the fight."We have at last met McCulloch and his real soldiers.We cheered
   until we cried when we saw their ranks of gray, with the gold
   buttons and the gold braid and the gold stars.General McCulloch
   has taken me on his staff, and promised me a uniform.But how to
   clothe and feed and arm our men!We have only a few poor cattle,
   and no money.We shall whip the
   Yankees before we starve."Colfax did not cease to bewail the hardship which
her dear boy was forced to endure.He, who was used to linen sheets and
eider down, was without rough blanket or shelter; who was used to the
best table in the state, was reduced to husks."But, Aunt Lillian," cried Virginia, "he is fighting for the South.If
he were fed and clothed like the Yankees, we should not be half so proud
of him."Why set down for colder gaze the burning words that Clarence wrote to
Virginia.How she pored over that letter, and folded it so that even
the candle-droppings would not be creased and fall away!He was happy,
though wretched because he could not see her.It was the life he had
longed for.he was proving his usefulness
in this world.He was no longer the mere idler whom she had chidden."Jinny, do you remember saying so many years ago that our ruin would
   come of our not being able to work?How I wish you could see us
   felling trees to make bullet-moulds, and forging slugs for canister,
   and making cartridges at night with our bayonets as candlesticks.Jinny dear, I know that you will keep up your courage.I can see
   you sewing for us, I can hear you praying for us."It was, in truth, how Virginia learned to sew.Her fingers were pricked and sore weeks after she began.Sad
to relate, her bandages, shirts, and havelocks never reached the
front,--those havelocks, to withstand the heat of the tropic sun, which
were made in thousands by devoted Union women that first summer of the
war, to be ridiculed as nightcaps by the soldiers."Why should not our soldiers have them, too?"They were never so happy as when sewing on them against
the arrival of the Army of Liberation, which never came.The long, long days of heat dragged slowly, with little to cheer those
families separated from their dear ones by a great army.Clarence might
die, and a month--perhaps a year--pass without news, unless he were
brought a prisoner to St.How Virginia envied Maude because the
Union lists of dead and wounded would give her tidings of her brother
Tom, at least!How she coveted the many Union families, whose sons and
brothers were at the front, this privilege!We were speaking of the French Revolution, when, as Balzac remarked, to
be a spy was to be a patriot.Heads are not so cheap in our Anglo-Saxon
countries; passions not so fierce and uncontrollable.Compare, with a
prominent historian, our Boston Massacre and St.Compare Camp Jackson, or Baltimore, where a
few people were shot, with some Paris street scenes after the Bastille.Our own provost marshal was
hissed in the street, and called "Robespierre," and yet he did not fear
the assassin's knife.Our own Southern aristocrats were hemmed in in
a Union city (their own city).No women were thrown into prison, it is
true.Yet one was not permitted to shout for Jeff Davis on the street
corner before the provost's guard.Once in a while a detachment of
the Home Guards, commanded by a lieutenant; would march swiftly into a
street and stop before a house, whose occupants would run to the rear,
only to encounter another detachment in the alley.One day, in great excitement, Eugenie Renault rang the bell of the
Carvel house, and ran past the astounded Jackson up the stairs to
Virginia's room, the door of which she burst open.she cried, "Puss Russell's house is surrounded by Yankees,
and Puss and Emily and all the family are prisoners!"said Virginia, dropping in her excitement her
last year's bonnet, which she was trimming with red, white, and red."Because," said Eugenie, sputtering with indignation "because they waved
at some of our poor fellows who were being taken to the slave pen.Russell's house under guard--Puss had a
small--"

"Confederate flag," put in Virginia, smiling in spite of herself."And she waved it between the shutters," Eugenie continued."And some
one told, the provost marshal.He has had the house surrounded, and the
family have to stay there.""Then," said Miss Renault, in a voice of awe, "then each one of the
family is to have just a common army ration.They are to be treated as
prisoners.""Oh, those Yankees are detestable!"As soon as our army is organized and equipped, they shall
pay for it ten times over."She tried on the bonnet, conspicuous with
its red and white ribbons, before the glass.Then she ran to the closet
and drew forth the white gown with its red trimmings."Wait for me,
Genie," she said, "and we'll go down to Puss's house together.It may
cheer her to see us.""But not in that dress," said Eugenie, aghast.And her eyes flashed so
that Eugenie was frightened.Miss Renault regarded her friend with something of adoration from
beneath her black lashes.It was about five in the afternoon when they
started out together under Virginia's white parasol, Eugenie's slimmer
courage upheld by her friend's bearing.We must remember that
Virginia was young, and that her feelings were akin to those our
great-grandmothers experienced when the British held New York.It was
as if she had been born to wear the red and white of the South.Elderly
gentlemen of Northern persuasion paused in their homeward walk to smile
in admiration,--some sadly, as Mr.Young gentlemen found an
excuse to retrace their steps a block or two.But Virginia walked on
air, and saw nothing.She was between fierce anger and exaltation.She
did not deign to drop her eyes as low as the citizen sergeant and guard
in front of Puss Russell's house (these men were only human, after all);
she did not so much as glance at the curious people standing on the
corner, who could not resist a murmur of delight.The citizen sergeant
only smiled, and made no move to arrest the young lady in red and white.Nor did Puss fling open the blinds and wave at her.Russell won't let her," said Virginia,
disconsolately, "Genie, let's go to headquarters, and show this Yankee
General Fremont that we are not afraid of him."Eugenie's breath was taken away by the very boldness of this
proposition.. She looked up timidly into Virginia's face, and
hero-worship got the better of prudence.The house which General Fremont appropriated for his use when he came
back from Europe to assume command in the West was not a modest one.It
still stands, a large mansion of brick with a stone front, very tall and
very wide, with an elaborate cornice and plate-glass windows, both tall
and broad, and a high basement.Two stately stone porches capped by
elaborate iron railings adorn it in front and on the side.In short, the house is of that type built
by many wealthy gentlemen in the middle of the century, which has best
stood the test of time,--the only type which, if repeated to-day, would
not clash with the architectural education which we are receiving.A
spacious yard well above the pavement surrounds it, sustained by a wall
of dressed stones, capped by an iron fence.The whole expressed wealth,
security, solidity, conservatism.Alas, that the coal deposits under
the black mud of our Western states should, at length, have driven
the owners of these houses out of them!They are now blackened, almost
buried in soot; empty, or half-tenanted by boarders, Descendants of the
old families pass them on their way to business or to the theatre with
a sigh.The sons of those who owned them have built westward, and
west-ward again, until now they are six miles from the river.On that summer evening forty years ago, when Virginia and Eugenie came
in sight of the house, a scene of great animation was before them.Talk
was rife over the commanding general's pomp and circumstance.He had
just returned from Europe, where pomp and circumstance and the military
were wedded.Foreign officers should come to America to teach our
army dress and manners.A dashing Hungarian commanded the general's
body-guard, which honorable corps was even then drawn up in the street
before the house, surrounded at a respectable distance by a crowd
that feared to jest.They felt like it save when they caught the stern
military eye of the Hungarian captain.Virginia gazed at the glittering
uniforms, resplendent in the sun, and at the sleek and well-fed horses,
and scalding tears came as she thought of the half-starved rabble of
Southern patriots on the burning prairies.Just then a sharp command
escaped in broken English from the Hungarian.The people in the yard of
the mansion parted, and the General himself walked proudly out of the
gate to the curb, where his charger was pawing the gutter.As he put
foot to the stirrup, the eye of the great man (once candidate, and again
to be, for President) caught the glint of red and white on the corner.For an instant he stood transfixed to the spot, with one leg in the air.Then he took it down again and spoke to a young officer of his staff,
who smiled and began to walk toward them.Little Eugenie's knees
trembled.She seized Virginia's arm, and whispered in agony."Oh, Jinny, you are to be arrested, after all.Oh, I wish you hadn't
been so bold!""Hush," said Virginia, as she prepared to slay the young officer with
a look.She felt like flying at his throat, and choking him for the
insolence of that smile.How dare he march undaunted to within six paces
of those eyes?The crowd drew back, But did Miss Carvel retreat?"Oh, I hope he will arrest me," she said passionately, to Eugenie."He will start a conflagration beyond the power of any Yankee to quell."No, those were not
the words, surely.He bowed very
low and said:

"Ladies, the General's compliments, and he begs that this much of the
sidewalk may be kept clear for a few moments."What was left for them, after that, save a retreat?But he was not
precipitate.Miss Virginia crossed the street with a dignity and bearing
which drew even the eyes of the body-guard to one side.And there she
stood haughtily until the guard and the General had thundered away.A
crowd of black-coated civilians, and quartermasters and other officers
in uniform, poured out of the basement of the house into the yards.One
civilian, a youngish man a little inclined to stoutness, stopped at the
gate, stared, then thrust some papers in his pocket and hurried down
the side street.Three blocks thence he appeared abreast of Miss Carvel.More remarkable still, he lifted his hat clear of his head.Hopper, with his newly acquired equanimity and poise,
startled her."May I have the pleasure," said that gentleman, "of accompanying you
home?"Eugenie giggled, Virginia was more annoyed than she showed."You must not come out of your way," she said."I am
sure you must go back to the store.Had Virginia but known, this occasional tartness in her speech gave
Eliphalet an infinite delight, even while it hurt him.His was a nature
which liked to gloat over a goal on the horizon He cared not a whit for
sweet girls; they cloyed.He
had revised his vocabulary for just such an occasion, and thrown out
some of the vernacular."Business is not so pressing nowadays, Miss Carvel," he answered, with a
shade of meaning."Then existence must be rather heavy for you," she said.She made
no attempt to introduce him to Eugenie."If we should have any more
victories like Bull Run, prosperity will come back with a rush," said
the son of Massachusetts."Southern Confederacy, with Missouri one of
its stars an industrial development of the South--fortunes in cotton."Virginia turned quickly, "Oh, how dare you?""How dare you
speak flippantly of such things?"His suavity was far from overthrown."I assure you that I want to see the
South win."What he did not know was that words seldom convince women.But he added something which reduced her incredulity for the time."Do
you cal'late," said he,--that I could work for your father, and wish
ruin to his country?""But you are a Yankee born," she exclaimed."There be a few sane Yankees," replied Mr.A remark
which made Eugenie laugh outright, and Virginia could not refrain from a
smile.But much against her will he walked home with her.She was indignant by
the time she reached Locust Street.He had never dared do such a thing
before, What had got into the man?Was it because he had become
a manager, and governed the business during her father's frequent
absences?Hopper's politics, he would always be to
her a low-born Yankee, a person wholly unworthy of notice.At the corner of Olive Street, a young man walking with long strides
almost bumped into them.He paused looked back, and bowed as if
uncertain of an acknowledgment.He had
been very close to her, and she had had time to notice that his coat was
threadbare.When she looked again, he had covered half the block.Why should she care if Stephen Brice had seen her in company with Mr.Eliphalet, too, had seen Stephen, and this had added zest to his
enjoyment.It was part of the fruits of his reward.He wished in that
short walk that he might meet Mr.Cluyme and Belle, and every man and
woman and child in the city whom he knew.From time to time he glanced
at the severe profile of the aristocrat beside him (he had to look up a
bit, likewise), and that look set him down among the beasts of prey.For she was his rightful prey, and he meant not to lose one tittle of
enjoyment in the progress of the game.Many and many a night in the bare
little back room at Miss Crane's, Eliphalet had gloated over the very
event which was now come to pass.Not a step of the way but what he had
lived through before.The future is laid open to such men as he.Since he had first seen the
black cloud of war rolling up from the South, a hundred times had he
rehearsed the scene with Colonel Carvel which had actually taken place
a week before.A hundred times had he prepared his speech and manner for
this first appearance in public with Virginia after he had forced the
right to walk in her company.The words he had prepared--commonplace, to
be sure, but carefully chosen--flowed from his lips in a continual nasal
stream.The girl answered absently, her feminine instinct groping after
a reason for it all.She brightened when she saw her father at the
doors and, saying good by to Eugenie, tripped up the steps, bowing to
Eliphalet coldly."Why, bless us, Jinny," said the Colonel, "you haven't been parading the
town in that costume!You'll have us in Lynch's slave pen by to-morrow
night.laughed he, patting her under the chin, "there's no
doubt about your sentiments, anyhow.""I've been over to Puss Russell's house," said she, breathless."They've
closed it up, you know--" (He nodded.)"And then we went--Eugenie and I,
to headquarters, just to see what the Yankees would do.""You must take care, honey,"
he said, lowering his voice."They suspect me now of communicating with
the Governor and McCulloch.Jinny, it's all very well to be brave, and
to stand by your colors.But this sort of thing," said he, stroking the
gown, "this sort of thing doesn't help the South, my dear, and only
sets spies upon us.Ned tells me that there was a man in plain clothes
standing in the alley last night for three hours.""Pa," cried the girl, "I'm so sorry."Suddenly searching his face with
a swift instinct, she perceived that these months had made it yellow and
lined."Pa, dear, you must come to Glencoe to-morrow and rest You must
not go off on any more trips.""It isn't the trips, Jinny There are duties, my dear, pleasant
duties--Jinny--"

"Yes?"The Colonel's eye had suddenly fallen on Mr.Hopper, who was still
standing at the bottom of the steps.He checked himself abruptly as
Eliphalet pulled off his hat,

"Howdy, Colonel?"Virginia was motionless, with her back to the intruder, She was frozen
by a presentiment.As she saw her father start down the steps, she
yearned to throw herself in front of him--to warn him of something; she
knew not what.Then she heard the Colonel's voice, courteous and kindly
as ever.And yet it broke a little as he greeted his visitor."Won't--won't you come in, Mr.Virginia started

"I don't know but what I will, thank you, Colonel," he answered; easily."I took the liberty of walking home with your daughter."Virginia fairly flew into the house and up the stairs.Gaining her room,
she shut the door and turned the key, as though he might pursue her
there.The man's face had all at once become a terror.She threw herself
on the lounge and buried her face in her hands, and she saw it still
leering at her with a new confidence.Presently she grew calmer; rising,
she put on the plainest of her scanty wardrobe, and went down the
stairs, all in a strange trepidation new to her.She had never been in
fear of a man before.She hearkened over the banisters for his voice,
heard it, and summoned all her courage.How cowardly she had been to
leave her father alone with him.Colfax
ignored him as completely as if his chair had been vacant He glanced at
that lady once, and smiled, for he was tasting the sweets of victory.It was Virginia who entertained him, and even the Colonel never guessed
what it cost her.Eliphalet himself marvelled at her change of manner,
and gloated over that likewise.Not a turn or a quiver of the victim's
pain is missed by your beast of prey.The Colonel was gravely polite,
but preoccupied.Had he wished it, he could not have been rude to a
guest.Hopper a cigar with the same air that he would
have given it to a governor."Thank'ee, Colonel, I don't smoke," he said, waving the bog away.Colfax flung herself out of the room.It was ten o'clock when Eliphalet reached Miss Crane's, and picked his
way up the front steps where the boarders were gathered."The war doesn't seem to make any difference in your business, Mr.Hopper," his landlady remarked, "where have you been so late?""I happened round at Colonel Carvel's this afternoon, and stayed for tea
with 'em," he answered, striving to speak casually.Abner Reed's room later than usual that
night.THE SCOURGE OF WAR

"Virginia," said Mrs.Colfax, the next morning on coming downstairs, "I
am going back to Bellegarde today.I really cannot put up with such a
person as Comyn had here to tea last night."It is safe to say that she had never accurately
gauged the force which Virginia's respect for her elders, and affection
for her aunt through Clarence, held in check.Now there had arisen in front of her a tall
person of authority, before whom she deferred instinctively.It was not
what Virginia said, for she would not stoop to tirade.Colfax sank
into a chair, seeing only the blurred lines of a newspaper the girl had
thrust into her hand."There has been a battle at Wilson's Creek," said Virginia, in an
emotionless voice."General Lyon is killed, for which I suppose we
should be thankful.More than seven hundred of the wounded are on their
way here.They are bringing them one hundred and twenty miles, from
Springfield to Rollo, in rough army wagons, with scarcely anything to
eat or drink.""At what time shall I order the carriage
to take you to Bellegarde?"Colfax leaned forward and caught the hem of her niece's gown."Oh,
let me stay," she cried, "let me stay."As you please, Aunt Lillian," she answered."You know that you may
always stay here.I only beg of you one thing, that when you have
anything to complain of, you will bring it to me, and not mention it
before Pa."Oh, Jinny," sobbed the lady, in tears again, "how can you be so cruel
at such a time, when my nerves are all in pieces?"But she did not lift her voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for
Colonel Carvel's house.All day long Virginia, assisted by Uncle Ben and
Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which
she had long denied herself.At evening she went to the station at
Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed
back by the soldiers, until the trains came in.Alas, the heavy basket
which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again.The first
hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were
laid groaning on the bottom of great furniture vans, and carted to the
new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.The next day many good women went there, Rebel and Union alike, to have
their hearts wrung.The new and cheap building standing in the hot sun
reeked with white wash and paint.The miserable men lay on the hard
floor, still in the matted clothes they had worn in battle.Those were
the first days of the war, when the wages of our passions first came to
appal us.Many of the wounds had not been tended since they were dressed
on the field weeks before.Colfax went too, with the Colonel and her niece, although she
declared repeatedly that she could not go through with such an
ordeal.Carvel had to assist her to the
waiting-room.Then he went back to the improvised wards to find Virginia
busy over a gaunt Arkansan of Price's army, whose pitiful, fever-glazed
eyes were following her every motion.His frontiersman's clothes,
stained with blackened blood, hung limp over his wasted body.At
Virginia's bidding the Colonel ran downstairs for a bucket of fresh
water, and she washed the caked dust from his face and hands.Brinsmade who got the surgeon to dress the man's wound, and to prescribe
some of the broth from Virginia's basket.For the first time since the
war began something of happiness entered her breast.Brinsmade who was everywhere that day, answering the
questions of distracted mothers and fathers and sisters who thronged
the place; consulting with the surgeons; helping the few who knew how to
work in placing mattresses under the worst cases; or again he might have
been seen seated on the bare floor with a pad on his knee, taking down
the names of dear ones in distant states,--that he might spend his night
writing to them.They put a mattress under the Arkansan.Virginia did not leave him until
he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken
face.Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that
rose on every side, she was choosing her way swiftly down the room to
join her father and aunt in the carriage below.She felt that another little while
in this heated, horrible place would drive her mad.She was almost at
the door when she came suddenly upon a sight that made her pause.An elderly lady in widow's black was kneeling beside a man groaning in
mortal agony, fanning away the flies already gathering about his face.He wore the uniform of a Union sergeant,--dusty and splotched and torn.A small Testament was clasped convulsively in the fingers of his right
band.Virginia lingered, whelmed in pity,
thrilled by a wonderful womanliness of her who knelt there.Her face the
girl had not even seen, for it was bent over the man.The sweetness of
her voice held Virginia as in a spell, and the sergeant stopped groaning
that he might listen:

"You have a wife?""A boy, ma'am--born the week--before I came--away.""I shall write to your wife," said the lady, so gently that Virginia
could scarce hear, "and tell her that you are cared for.He gave the address faintly--some little town in Minnesota.Then he
added, "God bless you, lady."Just then the chief surgeon came and stood over them.The lady turned
her face up to him, and tears sparkled in her eyes.Virginia felt them
wet in her own.Nobility, character,
efficiency,-all were written on that face.Nobility spoke in the large
features, in the generous mouth, in the calm, gray eyes.Virginia had
seen her often before, but not until now was the woman revealed to her."Doctor, could this man's life be saved if I took him to my home?"The surgeon got down beside her and took the man's pulse.For a while the doctor knelt there, shaking his head."He has
fainted," he said.The surgeon
smiled,--such a smile as a good man gives after eighteen hours of
amputating, of bandaging, of advising,--work which requires a firm hand,
a clear eye and brain, and a good heart.Brice," he said, "I shall be glad to get you permission
to take him, but we must first make him worth the taking.He glanced hurriedly about the busy room, and
then added, "We must have one more to help us.""I am afraid we must go, dear," he said, "your aunt is getting
impatient.""Won't you please go without me, Pa?""Perhaps I can be of
some use."The Colonel cast a wondering glance at the limp uniform, and went
away.The surgeon, who knew the Carvel family, gave Virginia a look of
astonishment.Brice's searching gaze that brought the color
to the girl's, face."Thank you, my dear," she said simply.As soon as he could get his sister-in-law off to Locust Street in the
carriage, Colonel Carvel came back.For two reeking hours he stood
against the newly plastered wall.Even he was surprised at the fortitude
and skill Virginia showed from the very first, when she had deftly
cut away the stiffened blue cloth, and helped to take off the rough
bandages.At length the fearful operation was finished, and the weary
surgeon, gathering up his box, expressed with all the energy left to
him, his thanks to the two ladies.The work of her hands had sustained
her while it lasted, but now the ordeal was come.She went down the
stairs on her father's arm, and out into the air.Brice was beside her, and had taken her by the hand.she was saying, "God will reward you for this act.You have
taught many of us to-day a lesson we should have learned in our Bibles."Virginia trembled with many emotions, but she answered nothing.The
mere presence of this woman had a strange effect upon the girl,--she was
filled with a longing unutterable.It was not because Margaret Brice
was the mother of him whose life had been so strangely blended with
hers--whom she saw in her dreams.And yet now some of Stephen's traits
seemed to come to her understanding, as by a revelation.Virginia had
labored through the heat of the day by Margaret Brice's side doing His
work, which levels all feuds and makes all women sisters.One brief
second had been needful for the spell.The Colonel bowed with that courtesy and respect which distinguished
him, and Mrs.Brice left them to go back into the room of torment, and
watch by the sergeant's pallet.Virginia's eyes followed her up the
stairs, and then she and her father walked slowly to the carriage.With
her foot on the step Virginia paused."Pa," she said, "do you think it would be possible to get them to let us
take that Arkansan into our house?""Why, honey, I'll ask Brinsmade if you like," said the Colonel."Here he
comes now, and Anne."It was Virginia who put the question to him."My dear," replied that gentleman, patting her, "I would do anything
in the world for you.I'll see General Fremont this very afternoon.Virginia," he added, soberly, "it is such acts as yours to-day that give
us courage to live in these times.""Oh, Jinny, I saw what you were doing for one of our men.It was well that Virginia did not see the smile on
the face of the commanding general when Mr.Brinsmade at length got to
him with her request.This was before the days when the wounded arrived
by the thousands, when the zeal of the Southern ladies threatened to
throw out of gear the workings of a great system.But the General, had
had his eye on Mr.Brinsmade, with dignity, "is a gentleman.When he gives his word, it is sacred, sir.""Even to an enemy," the General put in, "By George, Brinsmade, unless I
knew you, I should think that you were half rebel yourself.Well, well,
he may have his Arkansan."Brinsmade, when he conveyed the news to the Carvel house, did not
say that he had wasted a precious afternoon in the attempt to interview
his Excellency, the Commander in-chief.It was like obtaining an
audience with the Sultan or the Czar.Citizens who had been prominent
in affairs for twenty years, philanthropists and patriotic-spirited men
like Mr.Brinsmade, the mayor, and all the ex-mayors mopped their brows
in one of the general's anterooms of the big mansion, and wrangled with
beardless youths in bright uniforms who were part of the chain.The
General might have been a Richelieu, a Marlborough.His European notions
of uniformed inaccessibility he carried out to the letter.He was
a royal personage, seldom seen, who went abroad in the midst of a
glittering guard.It did not seem to weigh with his Excellency that
these simple and democratic gentlemen would not put up with this sort of
thing.That they who had saved the city to the Union were more or less
in communication with a simple and democratic President; that in all
their lives they had never been in the habit of sitting idly for two
hours to mop their brows.On the other hand, once you got beyond the gold lace and the etiquette,
you discovered a good man and a patriot.It was far from being the
General's fault that Mr.Hopper and others made money in mules and
worthless army blankets.Such things always have been, and always will
be unavoidable when this great country of ours rises from the deep sleep
of security into which her sons have lulled her, to demand her sword.We
shall never be able to realize that the maintenance of a standing army
of comfortable size will save millions in the end.So much for Democracy
when it becomes a catchword.The General was a good man, had he done nothing else than encourage the
Western Sanitary Commission, that glorious army of drilled men and women
who gave up all to relieve the suffering which the war was causing.Would that a novel--a great novel--might be written setting forth with
truth its doings.The hero of it could be Calvin Brinsmade, and a nobler
hero than he was never under a man's hand.For the glory of generals
fades beside his glory.Brice home from
her trying day in the hospital.Stephen, just returned from drill
at Verandah hall, met her at the door.She would not listen to his
entreaties to rest, but in the evening, as usual, took her sewing to the
porch behind the house, where there was a little breeze."Such a singular thing happened to-day, Stephen," she said."It was
while we were trying to save the life of a poor sergeant who had lost
his arm.I hope we shall be allowed to have him here."It was soon after I had come upon this poor fellow," she said."I saw
the--the flies around him.And as I got down beside him to fan them away
I had such a queer sensation.I knew that some one was standing behind
me, looking at me.Allerdyce came, and I asked him about the
man, and he said there was a chance of saving him if we could only get
help.Then some one spoke up,--such a sweet voice.It was that Miss
Carvel my dear, with whom you had such a strange experience when you
bought Hester, and to whose party you once went.Do you remember that
they offered us their house in Glencoe when the Judge was so ill?""She is a wonderful creature," his mother continued.And wasn't it a remarkable offer for a Southern woman to
make?They feel so bitterly, and--and I do not blame them."The good
lady put down on her lap the night-shirt she was making.And, my dear, her
capability astonished me.One might have thought that she had always
been a nurse.The experience was a dreadful one for me--what must
it have been for her.After the operation was over, I followed her
downstairs to where she was standing with her father in front of the
building, waiting for their carriage.I felt that I must say something
to her, for in all my life I have never seen a nobler thing done.When I
saw her there, I scarcely knew what to say.It was then three o'clock, and she had been working steadily in that
place since morning.I am sure she could not have borne it much longer.Sheer courage carried her through it, I know, for her hand trembled so
when I took it, and she was very pale.Her father, the Colonel, was with her, and he bowed to me with such
politeness.He had stood against the wall all the while we had worked,
and he brought a mattress for us.I have heard that his house is
watched, and that they have him under suspicion for communicating
with the Confederate leaders."I hope they will not get into any trouble.""I hope not, mother," said Stephen.It was two mornings later that Judge Whipple and Stephen drove to the
Iron Mountain depot, where they found a German company of Home Guards
drawn up.On the long wooden platform under the sheds Stephen
caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their
countrymen.Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands.The tears ran
on his cheeks, and he could not speak for emotion.Judge Whipple, grim
and silent, stood apart.But he uncovered his head with the others when
the train rolled in.Reverently they entered a car where the pine boxes
were piled one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of
Captain Carl Richter.Far from the land of his birth, among those same oaks on Bloody Hill
where brave Lyon fell, he had gladly given up his life for the new
country and the new cause he had made his own.That afternoon in the cemetery, as the smoke of the last salute to a
hero hung in the flickering light and drifted upward through the
great trees, as the still air was yet quivering with the notes of the
bugle-call which is the soldiers requiem, a tall figure, gaunt and bent,
stepped out from behind the blue line of the troops.He carried in his hand a wreath of white roses--the first
of many to be laid on Richter's grave.And yet he had not filled it
with sadness.For many a month, and many a year, Stephen could not look
upon his empty place without a pang.He missed the cheery songs and the
earnest presence even more than he had thought.Carl Richter,--as his
father before him,--had lived for others.Both had sacrificed their
bodies for a cause.One of them might be pictured as he trudged with
Father Jahn from door to door through the Rhine country, or shouldering
at sixteen a heavy musket in the Landwehr's ranks to drive the tyrant
Napoleon from the beloved Fatherland Later, aged before his time,
his wife dead of misery, decrepit and prison-worn in the service of a
thankless country, his hopes lived again in Carl, the swordsman of Jena.Then came the pitiful Revolution, the sundering of all ties, the elder
man left to drag out his few weary days before a shattered altar.In
Carl a new aspiration had sprung up, a new patriotism stirred.His, too,
had been the sacrifice.Happy in death, for he had helped perpetuate
that great Union which should be for all time the refuge of the
oppressed.THE LIST OF SIXTY

One chilling day in November, when an icy rain was falling on the black
mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window.Her eye was
caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched
over them.One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame.They were
pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a buckled wheel.On the seat a
man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his
feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a
ragged blanket.In the body of the wagon, lying on a mattress pressed
down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware,
lay a gaunt woman in the rain.Her eyes were closed, and a hump on the
surface of the dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there.From such a picture the girl fled in tears.But the sight of it, and of
others like it, haunted her for weeks.Through those last dreary days of
November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and
prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes.The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been
written.Still they came by the hundred, those families.The father of one, hale and strong when
they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house.The walls
of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart.Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities.He found
time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his
correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and
midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.Throughout December they poured in on the afflicted city, already
overtaxed.All the way to Springfield the road was lined with remains
of articles once dear--a child's doll, a little rocking-chair, a 
print that has hung in the best room, a Bible text.Anne Brinsmade, driven by Nicodemus, went from house to house to solicit
old clothes, and take them to the crowded place of detention.Christmas
was drawing near--a sorry Christmas, in truth.And many of the wanderers
were unclothed and unfed.More battles had been fought; factions had arisen among Union men.Louis to take charge of the Department,
and the other with his wondrous body-guard was gone.The most serious problem confronting the new general--was how to care
for the refugees.A council of citizens was called at headquarters, and
the verdict went forth in the never-to-be-forgotten Orders No."Inasmuch," said the General, "as the Secession army had driven these
people from their homes, Secession sympathizers should be made to
support them."He added that the city was unquestionably full of these.Indignation was rife the day that order was published.Sixty prominent
"disloyalists" were to be chosen and assessed to make up a sum of ten
thousand dollars."They may sell my house over my head before I will pay a cent," cried
Mr.Who were
to be on this mysterious list of "Sixty"?That was the all-absorbing
question of the town.It was an easy matter to pick the conspicuous
ones.Colonel Carvel was sure to be there, and Mr.Addison Colfax
lived for days in a fermented state of excitement which she declared
would break her down; and which, despite her many cares and worries,
gave her niece not a little amusement.For Virginia was human, and one
morning she went to her aunt's room to read this editorial from the
newspaper:-- "For the relief of many palpitating hearts it may be well
to state that we understand only two ladies are on the ten thousand
dollar list.""Jinny," she cried, "how can you be so cruel as to read me that, when
you know that I am in a state of frenzy now?It makes it an absolute certainty that Madame Jules and I will have to
pay.We are the only women of importance in the city."That afternoon she made good her much-uttered threat, and drove to
Bellegarde.Only the Colonel and Virginia and Mammy Easter and Ned were
left in the big house.Rosetta and Uncle Ben and Jackson had been
hired out, and the horses sold,--all save old Dick, who was running,
long-haired, in the fields at Glencoe.Christmas eve was a steel-gray day, and the sleet froze as it fell.Since morning Colonel Carvel had sat poking the sitting-room fire, or
pacing the floor restlessly.He was observed
night and day by Federal detectives.Virginia strove to amuse him, to
conceal her anxiety as she watched him.Well she knew that but for her
he would long since have fled southward, and often in the bitterness of
the night-time she blamed herself for not telling him to go.Ten years
had seemed to pass over him since the war had begun.All day long she had been striving to put away from her the memory of
Christmas eves past and gone of her father's early home-coming from the
store, a mysterious smile on his face; of Captain Lige stamping noisily
into the house, exchanging uproarious jests with Ned and Jackson.The
Captain had always carried under his arm a shapeless bundle which he
would confide to Ned with a knowing wink.And then the house would be
lighted from top to bottom, and Mr.Brinsmade came in for a long evening with Mr.Carvel over great bowls of
apple toddy and egg-nog.And Virginia would have her own friends in the
big parlor.That parlor was shut up now, and icy cold.Then there was Judge Whipple, the joyous event of whose year was his
Christmas dinner at Colonel Carvel's house.Brice's little table, and wondered whether he would miss
them as much as they missed him.War may break friendships, but it
cannot take away the sacredness of memories.The sombre daylight was drawing to an early close as the two stood
looking out of the sitting-room window.A man's figure muffled in
a greatcoat slanting carefully across the street caught their eyes.It was the same United States deputy marshal she had
seen the day before at Mr."Pa," she cried, "do you think he is coming here?""Pa, you must promise me to take down the mahogany bed in your room.I could not bear to see them take that.Let me put
it in the garret."The Colonel was distressed, but he spoke without a tremor.We must leave this house just as it is."Then he added,
strangely enough for him, "God's will be done."And Ned, who was cook and housemaid, came in with
his apron on."Does you want to see folks, Marse Comyn?"The Colonel rose, and went to the door himself.He was an imposing
figure as he stood in the windy vestibule, confronting the deputy.Virginia's first impulse was to shrink under the stairs.Then she came
out and stood beside her father.He was a young man with a smooth face, and
a frank brown eye which paid its tribute to Virginia.He did not appear
to relish the duty thrust upon him.He fumbled in his coat and drew from
his inner pocket a paper."Colonel Carvel," said he, "by order of Major General Halleck, I serve
you with this notice to pay the sum of three hundred and fifty dollars
for the benefit of the destitute families which the Rebels have driven
from their homes.In default of payment within a reasonable time such
personal articles will be seized and sold at public auction as will
satisfy the demand against you.""You may tell the
General that the articles may be seized.That I will not, while in my
right mind, be forced to support persons who have no claim upon me."It was said in the tone in which he might have refused an invitation to
dinner.He had gone into many houses that week;
had seen indignation, hysterics, frenzy.He had even heard men and women
whose sons and brothers were in the army of secession proclaim their
loyalty to the Union.But this dignity, and the quiet scorn of the girl
who had stood silent beside them, were new.He bowed, and casting his
eyes to the vestibule, was glad to escape from the house.Then he turned toward Virginia, thoughtfully
pulled his goatee, and laughed gently."Lordy, we haven't got three
hundred and fifty dollars to our names," said he.That fierce valley of the
Missouri, which belches fitful blizzards from December to March, is
sometimes quiet.Then the hot winds come up from the Gulf, and sleet
melts, and windows are opened.In those days the streets will be fetlock
deep in soft mud.It is neither summer, nor winter, nor spring, nor
anything.It was such a languorous afternoon in January that a furniture van,
accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States
Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr.Eugenie,
watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who
came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his
French ancestors.Mammy Easter opened the door, and then stood with her arms akimbo, amply
filling its place.Her lips protruded, and an expression of defiance
hard to describe sat on her honest black face.I 'low you knows dat jes as well as me."An embarrassed
silence, and then from Mammy, "Whaffor you laffin at?""Now I reckon you knows dat he ain't.Ef he was, you ain't come here
'quirin' in dat honey voice.""You tink I
dunno whaffor you come?You done come heah to rifle, an' to loot, an'
to steal, an' to seize what ain't your'n.You come heah when young Marse
ain't to home ter rob him.""Ned, whaffor you hidin'
yonder?Ef yo' ain't man to protect Marse Comyn's prop-ty, jes han' over
Marse Comyn's gun."The marshal and his men had stood, half amused, more than half baffled
by this unexpected resistance.Mammy Easter looked so dangerous that it
was evident she was not to be passed without extreme bodily discomfort."Who is
you to come heah 'quiring fo' her!I ain't agwine--"

"Mammy!"Mammy backed out of the door and clutched at
her bandanna."Mammy, what is all this noise about?""These heah men, Miss Jinny, was gwine f'r t' carry away all yo' pa's
blongin's.I jes' tol' 'em dey ain't comin' in ovah dis heah body."He caught sight of the face of
Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly."I have a warrant here from the Provost Marshal, ma'am, to seize
personal property to satisfy a claim against Colonel Carvel."Virginia took the order, read it, and handed it back."I do not see how
I am to prevent you," she said.I--I can't tell you how sorry I am.Then he
entered the chill drawing-room, threw open the blinds and glanced around
him."I expect all that we want is right here," he said.And at the sight of
the great chandelier, with its cut-glass crystals, he whistled.Then he
walked over to the big English Rothfield piano and lifted the lid.Involuntarily he rested himself on the mahogany
stool, and ran his fingers over the keys.They seemed to Virginia,
standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.The piano, too, had been her mother's.It had once stood in the brick
house of her grandfather Colfax at Halcyondale.The songs of Beatrice
lay on the bottom shelf of the what-not near by.No more, of an evening
when they were alone, would Virginia quietly take them out and play
them over to the Colonel, as he sat dreaming in the window with his
cigar,--dreaming of a field on the borders of a wood, of a young girl
who held his hand, and sang them softly to herself as she walked by his
side.And, when they reached the house in the October twilight, she had
played them for him on this piano.Often he had told Virginia of those
days, and walked with her over those paths.The deputy closed the lid, and sent out to the van for a truck.For the first time she heard the words of Mammy Easter."Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey.Dis ain't no place for us,
I reckon."Her words were the essence of endearment.And yet, while she
pronounced them, she glared unceasingly at the intruders."Oh, de good
Lawd'll burn de wicked!"Virginia went back into the room
and stood before the deputy."Isn't there something else you could take?"I have a necklace--"

"No, miss.And there ain't nothing quite
so salable as pianos."She watched them, dry-eyed, as they carried it away.Only Mammy Easter guessed at the pain in Virginia's breast, and
that was because there was a pain in her own.They took the rosewood
what-not, but Virginia snatched the songs before the men could
touch them, and held them in her arms.They seized the mahogany
velvet-bottomed chairs, her uncle's wedding present to her mother; and,
last of all, they ruthlessly tore up the Brussels carpet, beginning near
the spot where Clarence had spilled ice-cream at one of her children's
parties.She could not bear to look into the dismantled room when they had gone.Ned closed the blinds once
more, and she herself turned the key in the lock, and went slowly up the
stairs.CHAPTER V. THE AUCTION

"Stephen," said the Judge, in his abrupt way, "there isn't a great deal
doing.Let's go over to the Secesh property sales."The seizures and intended sale of
secession property had stirred up immense bitterness and indignation in
the city.There were Unionists (lukewarm) who denounced the measure as
unjust and brutal.The feelings of Southerners, avowed and secret, may
only be surmised.Rigid ostracism was to be the price of bidding on any
goods displayed, and men who bought in handsome furniture on that day
because it was cheap have still, after forty years, cause to remember
it.It was not that Stephen feared ostracism.Anne Brinsmade was almost the
only girl left to him from among his former circle of acquaintances.The Misses Russell showed him very
plainly that they disapproved of his politics.The hospitable days at
that house were over.Miss Catherwood, when they met on the street,
pretended not to see him, and Eugenie Renault gave him but a timid nod.The loyal families to whose houses he now went were mostly Southerners,
in sentiment against forced auctions.However, he put on his coat, and sallied forth into the sharp air, the
Judge leaning on his arm."Stephen," said he, presently, "I guess I'll do a little bidding."And, if he really wished to bid,
Stephen knew likewise that no consideration would stop him."You don't approve of this proceeding, sir, I suppose," said the Judge."Then," said the Judge, tartly, "by bidding, we help to support starving
Union families.You should not be afraid to bid, sir.""I am not afraid to bid, Judge Whipple."He did not see the smile on the
Judge's face."Then you will bid in certain things for me," said Mr.Here
he hesitated, and shook free the rest of the sentence with a wrench."Colonel Carvel always had a lot of stuff I wanted.Now I've got the
chance to buy it cheap."There was silence again, for the space of a whole block.Finally,
Stephen managed to say:-- "You'll have to excuse me, sir.cried the Judge, stopping in the middle of a cross-street, so
that a wagon nearly ran over his toes."I was once a guest in Colonel Carvel's house, sir.Neither the young man nor the old knew all it was costing the other to
say these things.The Judge took a grim pleasure in eating his heart.And as for Stephen, he often went to his office through Locust Street,
which was out of his way, in the hope that he might catch a glimpse of
Virginia.He had guessed much of the privations she had gone through.He knew that the Colonel had hired out most of his slaves, and he had
actually seen the United States Police drive across Eleventh Street with
the piano that she had played on.The Judge was laughing quietly,--not a pleasant laugh to hear,--as they
came to Morgan's great warerooms.A crowd blocked the pavement, and
hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and
ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom
they spoke to.All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might
see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's
household goods.The long hall, which ran from street to street, was
packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly
against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing
all in a breath.The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way
fiercely to the stand, vowing over and over that the commotion was a
secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.In truth,
it was at the Judge's suggestion that a blue provost's guard was called
in later to protect the seized property.How many of those mahogany pieces, so ruthlessly tumbled about before
the public eye, meant a heartache!Wedding presents of long ago, dear to
many a bride with silvered hair, had been torn from the corner where the
children had played--children who now, alas, were grown and gone to war.Yes, that was the Brussels rug that had lain before the fire, and which
the little feet had worn in the corner.Those were the chairs the little
hands had harnessed, four in a row, and fallen on its side was the
armchair--the stage coach itself.There were the books, held up to
common gaze, that a beloved parent had thumbed with affection.Yes, and
here in another part of the hall were the family horses and the family
carriage that had gone so often back and forth from church with the
happy brood of children, now scattered and gone to war.As Stephen reached his place beside the Judge, Mr.And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have
dropped dead.The heavy dining-room table which meant so much to the
family went for a song to a young man recently come from Yankeeland,
whose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one
day grow rich enough to snap his fingers in the face of the Southern
aristocrats.Catherwood, his face
haggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her
silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.Stephen looked in vain for Colonel Carvel--for Virginia.He did not want
to see them there.He knew by heart the list of things which had been
taken from their house.He understood the feeling which had sent the
Judge here to bid them in.When the auctioneer came to the Carvel list, and the well-known name was
shouted out, the crowd responded with a stir and pressed closer to the
stand.And murmurs were plainly heard in more than one direction."Now, gentlemen, and ladies," said the seller, "this here is a genuine
English Rothfield piano once belonging to Colonel Carvel, and the
celebrated Judge Colfax of Kaintucky."He lingered fondly over the
names, that the impression might have time to sink deep."This here
magnificent instrument's worth at the very least" (another pause)
"twelve hundred dollars.He struck a base note of the keys, then a treble, and they vibrated
in the heated air of the big hall.Had he hit the little C of the top
octave, the tinkle of that also might have been heard."Gentlemen and ladies, we have to begin somewheres.A menacing murmur gave place to the accusing silence.Some there were
who gazed at the Rothfield with longing eyes, but who had no intention
of committing social suicide.Suddenly a voice, the rasp of which
penetrated to St.The owner was
a seedy man with a straw-, drunkard's mustache.He was leaning
against the body of Mrs.Russell's barouche (seized for sale), and those
about him shrank away as from smallpox.His hundred-dollar offer was
followed by a hiss.When Judge Whipple drew himself up to his full six feet, that was a
warning to those that knew him.As he doubled the bid, the words came
out with the aggressive distinctness of a man who through a long life
has been used to opposition.He with the gnawed yellow mustache pushed
himself clear of the barouche, his smouldering cigar butt dropping to
the floor.And this is how Judge Whipple braved public opinion once more.As he
stood there, defiant, many were the conjectures as to what he could wish
to do with the piano of his old friend.Those who knew the Judge (and
there were few who did not) pictured to themselves the dingy little
apartment where he lived, and smiled.Whatever his detractors might have
said of him, no one was ever heard to avow that he had bought or sold
anything for gain.Could it have been of admiration for
the fine old man who towered there glaring defiance at those about him?"Give me a strong and consistent enemy," some great personage has said,
"rather than a lukewarm friend."Three score and five years the Judge
had lived, and now some were beginning to suspect that he had a heart.But it was let out to many more
that day, and they went home praising him who had once pronounced his
name with bitterness.Before he of the yellow mustache could pick up
his cigar from the floor and make another bid, the Judge had cried out
a sum which was the total of Colonel Carvel's assessment.Many recall
to this day how fiercely he frowned when the applause broke forth
of itself; and when he turned to go they made a path for him, in
admiration, the length of the hall, down which he stalked, looking
neither to the right nor left.Stephen followed him, thankful for the
day which had brought him into the service of such a man.And so it came about that the other articles were returned to Colonel
Carvel with the marshal's compliments, and put back into the cold parlor
where they had stood for many years.The men who brought them offered to
put down the carpet, but by Virginia's orders the rolls were stood up in
the corner, and the floor left bare.And days passed into weeks, and no
sign or message came from Judge Whipple in regard to the piano he had
bought.Virginia did not dare mention it to the Colonel.It had been carried by six sweating <DW64>s up the
narrow stairs into the Judge's office.Whipple's orders cleared a corner of his inner office and bedroom of
papers and books and rubbish, and there the bulky instrument was finally
set up.The Judge watched the
proceeding grimly, choking now and again from the dust that was raised,
yet uttering never a word.He locked the lid when the van man handed him
the key, and thrust that in his pocket.Stephen had of late found enough to do in St.He was the kind of
man to whom promotions came unsought, and without noise.In the autumn
he had been made a captain in the Halleck Guards of the State Militia,
as a reward for his indefatigable work in the armories and his knowledge
of tactics.Twice his company had been called out at night, and once
they made a campaign as far as the Merimec and captured a party of
recruits who were destined for Jefferson Davis.Brinsmade heard of his promotion and this exploit, and yet scarcely
a day went by that he did not see the young man at the big hospital.For
Stephen helped in the work of the Sanitary Commission too, and so strove
to make up in zeal for the service in the field which he longed to give.Brinsmade moved out to their place on the
Bellefontaine Road.This was to force Anne to take a rest.For the
girl was worn out with watching at the hospitals, and with tending
the destitute mothers and children from the ranks of the refugees.The
Brinsmade place was not far from the Fair Grounds,--now a receiving
camp for the crude but eager regiments of the Northern states.Brinsmade's, when the day's duty was done, the young Union officers
used to ride, and often there would be half a dozen of them to tea.That
house, and other great houses on the Bellefontaine Road with which this
history has no occasion to deal, were as homes to many a poor fellow who
would never see home again.Sometimes Anne would gather together such
young ladies of her acquaintance from the neighbor hood and the city as
their interests and sympathies permitted to waltz with a Union officer,
and there would be a little dance.To these dances Stephen Brice was
usually invited.One such occasion occurred on a Friday in January, and Mr.Brinsmade
himself called in his buggy and drove Stephen to the country early in
the afternoon.He and Anne went for a walk along the river, the surface
of which was broken by lumps of yellow ice.Gray clouds hung low in the
sky as they picked their way over the frozen furrows of the ploughed
fields.The grass was all a yellow-brown, but the north wind which
swayed the bare trees brought a touch of color to Anne's cheeks.Before
they realized where they were, they had nearly crossed the Bellegarde
estate, and the house itself was come into view, standing high on the
<DW72> above the withered garden."The shutters are up," said Stephen.Colfax had
come out here not long a--"

"She came out for a day just before Christina," said Anne, smiling, "and
then she ran off to Kentucky.I think she was afraid that she was one of
the two women on the list of Sixty.""It must have been a blow to her pride when she found that she was not,"
said Stephen, who had a keen remembrance of her conduct upon a certain
Sunday not a year gone.Impelled by the same inclination, they walked in silence to the house
and sat down on the edge of the porch.The only motion in the view was
the smoke from the slave quarters twisting in the wind, and the hurrying
ice in the stream.said Anne, with a sigh, "how she loved to romp!What good
times we used to have here together!"But you could not make her show
it.The other morning when she came out to our house I found her sitting
at the piano.I am sure there were tears in her eyes, but she would not
let me see them.She made some joke about Spencer Catherwood running
away.What do you think the Judge will do with that piano, Stephen?""The day after they put it in his room he came in with a great black
cloth, which he spread over it.And Anne, turning to him timidly, gave him a long,
searching look."I think that we ought to go back."They went out by the long entrance road, through the naked woods.Only a little while before he had had one of those
vivid dreams of Virginia which left their impression, but not their
substance, to haunt him.On those rare days following the dreams her
spirit had its mastery over his.He pictured her then with a glow on her
face which was neither sadness nor mirth,--a glow that ministered to
him alone.And yet, he did not dare to think that he might have won her,
even if politics and war had not divided them.When the merriment of the dance was at its height that evening, Stephen
stood at the door of the long room, meditatively watching the bright
gowns and the flash of gold on the uniforms as they flitted past.Presently the opposite door opened, and he heard Mr.Brinsmade's voice
mingling with another, the excitable energy of which recalled some
familiar episode.Almost--so it seemed--at one motion, the owner of the
voice had come out of the door and had seized Stephen's hand in a warm
grasp,--a tall and spare figure in the dress of a senior officer.The
military frock, which fitted the man's character rather than the man,
was carelessly open, laying bare a gold-buttoned white waistcoat and an
expanse of shirt bosom which ended in a black stock tie.The ends of the
collar were apart the width of the red clipped beard, and the mustache
was cropped straight along the line of the upper lip.The forehead rose
high, and was brushed carelessly free of the hair.The nose was almost
straight, but combative."The boy doesn't remember me," said the gentleman, in quick tones,
smiling at Mr."Yes, sir, I do," Stephen made haste to answer.He glanced at the star
on the shoulder strap, and said."Now in command at Camp Benton, Stephen," Mr."Won't
you sit down, General?""No," said the General, emphatically waving away the chair.Then his keen face suddenly lighted with amusement,--and
mischief, Stephen thought."So you've heard of me since we met, sir?"Guess you heard I was crazy," said the General, in his downright
way."He's been reading the lies in the newspapers too, Brinsmade," the
General went on rapidly."I'll make 'em eat their newspapers for saying
I was crazy.That's the Secretary of War's doings.Ever tell you what
Cameron did, Brinsmade?He and his party were in Louisville last fall,
when I was serving in Kentucky, and came to my room in the Galt House.Well, we locked the door, and Miller sent us up a good lunch and wine,
After lunch, the Secretary lay on my bed, and we talked things over.He
asked me what I thought about things in Kentucky.Secretary, here is the whole Union line from the
Potomac to Kansas.Here's McClellan in the East with one hundred miles
of front.Here's Fremont in the West with one hundred miles.Here we
are in Kentucky, in the centre, with three hundred miles to defend.McClellan has a hundred thousand men, Fremont has sixty thousand.You
give us fellows with over three hundred miles only eighteen thousand.''Two hundred
thousand before we get through,' said I. Cameron pitched up his hands
in the air.says he, 'where are they to come from?''The
northwest is chuck full of regiments you fellows at Washington won't
accept,' said I.Secretary, you'll need 'em all and
more before we get done with this Rebellion.'Well, sir, he was very
friendly before we finished, and I thought the thing was all thrashed
out.he goes back to Washington and gives it out that I'm
crazy, and want two hundred thousand men in Kentucky.Then I am ordered
to report to Halleck in Missouri here, and he calls me back from Sedalia
because he believes the lies."Stephen, who had in truth read the stories in question a month or two
before, could not conceal his embarrassment He looked at the man in
front of him,--alert, masterful intelligent, frank to any stranger who
took his fancy,--and wondered how any one who had talked to him could
believe them."They have to print something, General," he said."I'll give 'em something to print later on," answered the General,
grimly."Brinsmade, you fellows did have
a session with Fremont, didn't you?Anderson sent me over here last
September, and the first man I ran across at the Planters' House was
Appleton. ''To see Fremont,'
I said.'You don't think
Fremont'll see you, do you?''Well,' says Tom, 'go
'round to his palace at six to-morrow morning and bribe that Hungarian
prince who runs his body-guard to get you a good place in the line of
senators and governors and first citizens, and before nightfall you
may get a sight of him, since you come from Anderson.Not one man in
a hundred,' says Appleton, I not one man in a hundred, reaches his
chief-of-staff.'Next morning," the General continued in a staccato
which was often his habit, "had breakfast before daybreak and went
'round there.Place just swarming with Californians--army contracts."More
Californians, and by gad--old Baron Steinberger with his nose hanging
over the register.""Fremont was a little difficult to get at, General," said Mr."Things were confused and discouraged when those first contracts were
awarded.Fremont was a good man, and it wasn't his fault that the
inexperience of his quartermasters permitted some of those men to get
rich."To be sure
he was--didn't get along with Blair.These court-martials you're having
here now have stirred up the whole country.I guess we'll hear now how
those fortunes were made.To listen to those witnesses lie about each
other on the stand is better than the theatre."Stephen laughed at the comical and vivid manner in which the General set
this matter forth.He himself had been present one day of the sittings
of the court-martial when one of the witnesses on the prices of mules
was that same seedy man with the straw- mustache who had bid for
Virginia's piano against the Judge."Come, Stephen," said the General, abruptly, "run and snatch one of
those pretty girls from my officers."They deserve more, sir," answered Stephen.Whereupon the General laid
his hand impulsively on the young man's shoulder, divining what Stephen
did not say.said be; "you are doing the work in this war, not we.We
do the damage--you repair it.Brinsmade and you
gentlemen who help him, where would our Western armies be?Don't you
go to the front yet a while, young man.We need the best we have
in reserve.""You've had military
training of some sort?""He's a captain in the Halleck Guards, sir," said Mr.Brinsmade,
generously, "and the best drillmaster we've had in this city.He's seen
service, too, General."Stephen reddened furiously and started to protest, when the General
cried:-- "It's more than I have in this war.Come, come, I knew he was a
soldier.Let's see what kind of a strategist he'll make.Brinsmade, have
you got such a thing as a map?"Brinsmade had, and led the way back
into the library.The General shut the door, lighted a cigar with a
single vigorous stroke of a match, and began to smoke with quick puffs.Stephen was puzzled how to receive the confidences the General was
giving out with such freedom.When the map was laid on the table, the General drew a pencil from his
pocket and pointed to the state of Kentucky.Then he drew a line from
Columbus to Bowling Green, through Forts Donelson and Henry."Now, Stephen," said he, "there's the Rebel line.Show me the proper
place to break it."Stephen hesitated a while, and then pointed at the centre.He drew a heavy line across the
first, and it ran almost in the bed of the Tennessee River."Very question Halleck asked me the other day, and that's
how I answered it.Now, gentlemen, there's a man named Grant down in
that part of the country.Ever heard of him,
Brinsmade?He used to live here once, and a year ago he was less than I
was.The recollection of the scene in the street by the Arsenal that May
morning not a year gone came to Stephen with a shock."I saw him," he cried; "he was Captain Grant that lived on the Gravois
Road.But surely this can't be the same man who seized Paducah and was
in that affair at Belmont."They kicked him around Springfield awhile, after
the war broke out, for a military carpet-bagger.Then they gave him for
a regiment the worst lot of ruffians you ever laid eyes on.He made 'em march halfway across the
state instead of taking the cars the Governor offered.I guess
he is the man that chased the Rebs out of Belmont.Then his boys broke
loose when they got into the town.The Rebs
came back and chased 'em out into their boats on the river.Brinsmade,
you remember hearing about that."Grant did the coolest thing you ever saw.He sat on his horse at the
top of the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on
the boat.Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a
cigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him.And then, sir,"
cried the General, excitedly, "what do you think he did?Hanged if he
didn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole
length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the
steamer.And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared.They were so
astonished they didn't even shoot the man."And now, Stephen," he added, "just you run off and take hold
of the prettiest girl you can find.If any of my boys object, say I sent
you."It was little Tiefel, now a first
lieutenant with a bristly beard and tanned face, come to town on a few
days' furlough.He had been with Lyon at Wilson's Creek, and he had
a sad story to tell of how he found poor Richter, lying stark on that
bloody field, with a smile of peace upon his face.Strange that he
should at length have been killed by a sabre!It was a sad meeting for those two, since each reminded the other of
a dear friend they would see no more on earth.They went out to sup
together in the German style; and gradually, over his beer, Tiefel
forgot his sorrow.Stephen listened with an ache to the little man's
tales of the campaigns he had been through.So that presently Tiefel
cried out:

"Why, my friend, you are melancholy as an owl."He is no more crazy than I am," said Stephen, warmly--

"Is he not?"answered Tiefel, "then I will show you a mistake.You
recall last November he was out to Sedalia to inspect the camp there,
and he sleeps in a little country store where I am quartered.Now up
gets your General Sherman in the middle of the night,--midnight,--and
marches up and down between the counters, and waves his arms.So, says
he, 'land so,' says he, 'Sterling Price will be here, and Steele here,
and this column will take that road, and so-and-so's a damned fool.So he walks up and down for three eternal hours.Says
he, 'Pope has no business to be at Osterville, and Steele here at
Sedalia with his regiments all over the place.They must both go into
camp at La Mine River, and form brigades and divisions, that the troops
may be handled.'""If that's insanity," cried Stephen so strongly as to surprise the
little man; "then I wish we had more insane generals.It just shows
how a malicious rumor will spread.What Sherman said about Pope's and
Steele's forces is true as Gospel, and if you ever took the trouble to
look into that situation, Tiefel, you would see it."And Stephen brought
down his mug on the table with a crash that made the bystanders jump.It was not a month after that that Sherman's prophecy of the quiet
general who had slid down the bluff at Belmont came true.The whole
country bummed with Grant's praises.Moving with great swiftness and
secrecy up the Tennessee, in company with the gunboats of Commodore
Foote, he had pierced the Confederate line at the very point Sherman
had indicated.Fort Henry had fallen, and Grant was even then moving to
besiege Donelson.Brinsmade prepared to leave at once for the battlefield, taking with
him too Paducah physicians and nurses.All day long the boat was loading
with sanitary stores and boxes of dainties for the wounded.It was muggy
and wet--characteristic of that winter--as Stephen pushed through the
drays on the slippery levee to the landing.He had with him a basket his mother had put up.Brinsmade from the Judge It was while he was picking his way
along the crowded decks that he ran into General Sherman.The General
seized him unceremoniously by the shoulder."Good-by, Stephen," he said."Good-by, General," said Stephen, shifting his basket to shake hands."Ordered to Paducah," said the General.He pulled Stephen off the guards
into an empty cabin."Brice," said he, earnestly, "I haven't forgotten
how you saved young Brinsmade at Camp Jackson.They tell me that you are
useful here.I say, don't go in unless you have to.I don't mean force,
you understand.But when you feel that you can go in, come to me or
write me a letter.That is," he added, seemingly inspecting Stephen's
white teeth with approbation, "if you're not afraid to serve under a
crazy man."It has been said that the General liked the lack of effusiveness of
Stephen's reply.ELIPHALET PLAYS HIS TRUMPS

Summer was come again.Through interminable days, the sun beat down upon
the city; and at night the tortured bricks flung back angrily the heat
with which he had filled them.Great battles had been fought, and vast
armies were drawing breath for greater ones to come."Jinny," said the Colonel one day, "as we don't seem to be much use in
town, I reckon we may as well go to Glencoe."Virginia, threw her arms around her father's neck.For many months
she had seen what the Colonel himself was slow to comprehend--that his
usefulness was gone.The days melted into weeks, and Sterling Price and
his army of liberation failed to come.The vigilant Union general and
his aides had long since closed all avenues to the South.For, one fine
morning toward the end of the previous summer, when the Colonel was
contemplating a journey, he had read that none might leave the city
without a pass, whereupon he went hurriedly to the office of the Provost
Marshal.There he had found a number of gentlemen in the same plight,
each waving a pass made out by the Provost Marshal's clerks, and waiting
for that officer's signature.The Colonel also procured one of these,
and fell into line.The Marshal gazed at the crowd, pulled off his coat,
and readily put his name to the passes of several gentlemen going east.Bub Ballington, whom the Colonel knew, but pretended not
to."Not very profitable to be a minute-man, eh?"Ballington trying not to look indignant
as he makes for the door.A small silver bell rings on the Marshal's
desk, the one word: "Spot!"breaks the intense silence, which is one way
of saying that Mr.Ballington is detained, and will probably be lodged
that night at Government expense."Well, Colonel Carvel, what can I do for you this morning?"asked the
Marshal, genially.The Colonel pushed back his hat and wiped his brow."I reckon I'll wait
till next week, Captain," said Mr."It's pretty hot to travel
just now."There were many in the office who
would have liked to laugh, but it did not pay to laugh at some people.In the proclamation of martial law was much to make life less endurable
than ever.All who were convicted by a court-martial of being rebels
were to have property confiscated, and slaves set free.Then there was
a certain oath to be taken by all citizens who did not wish to have
guardians appointed over their actions.There were many who swallowed
this oath and never felt any ill effects.Jacob Cluyme was one, and
came away feeling very virtuous.Hopper did not have indigestion after taking it, but
Colonel Carvel would sooner have eaten, gooseberry pie, which he had
never tasted but once.That summer had worn away, like a monster which turns and gives hot
gasps when you think it has expired.It took the Arkansan just a month,
under Virginia's care, to become well enough to be sent to a Northern
prison He was not precisely a Southern gentleman, and he went to sleep
over the "Idylls of the King."But he was admiring, and grateful, and
wept when he went off to the boat with the provost's guard, destined
for a Northern prison.He had taken her away from
her aunt (who would have nothing to do with him), and had given her
occupation.She nor her father never tired of hearing his rough tales of
Price's rough army.His departure was about the time when suspicions were growing set.The
favor had caused comment and trouble, hence there was no hope of giving
another sufferer the same comfort.One of
the mysterious gentlemen who had been seen in the vicinity of Colonel
Carvel's house was arrested on the ferry, but he had contrived to be rid
of the carpet-sack in which certain precious letters were carried.Hopper's visits to Locust Street had
continued at intervals of painful regularity.It is not necessary to
dwell upon his brilliant powers of conversation, nor to repeat the
platitudes which he repeated, for there was no significance in Mr.The Colonel had found that out, and was
thankful.His manners were better; his English decidedly better.It was for her father's sake, of course, that Virginia bore with
him.She tried to be just, and it
occurred to her that she had never before been just.Again and again she
repeated to herself that Eliphalet's devotion to the Colonel at this
low ebb of his fortunes had something in it of which she did not suspect
him.Hopper as an uneducated Yankee
and a person of commercial ideals.But now he was showing virtues,--if
virtues they were,--and she tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.With his great shrewdness and business ability, why did he not take
advantage of the many opportunities the war gave to make a fortune?For Virginia had of late been going to the store with the Colonel,--who
spent his mornings turning over piles of dusty papers, and Mr.Hopper
had always been at his desk.After this, Virginia even strove to be kind to him, but it was uphill
work.The front door never closed after one of his visits that suspicion
was not left behind.Could it be that
there was a motive under all this plotting?He struck her inevitably as
the kind who would be content to mine underground to attain an end.The
worst she could think of him was that he wished to ingratiate himself
now, in the hope that, when the war was ended, he might become a partner
in Mr.She had put even this away as unworthy of her.Once she had felt compelled to speak to her father on the subject."I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," she said."Not that I like him
any better now.But I do think that if he had been as unscrupulous as I thought, he
would have deserted you long ago for something more profitable.He would
not be sitting in the office day after day making plans for the business
when the war is over."She remembered how sadly he had smiled at her over the top of his paper."You are a good girl, Jinny," he said.Toward the end of July of that second summer riots broke out in the
city, and simultaneously a bright spot appeared on Virginia's horizon.This took the form, for Northerners, of a guerilla scare, and an order
was promptly issued for the enrollment of all the able-bodied men in the
ten wards as militia, subject to service in the state, to exterminate
the roving bands.Whereupon her Britannic Majesty became extremely
popular,--even with some who claimed for a birthplace the Emerald Isle.Hundreds who heretofore had valued but lightly their British citizenship
made haste to renew their allegiance; and many sought the office of the
English Consul whose claims on her Majesty's protection were vague, to
say the least.For the first time,
when Virginia walked to the store with her father, Eliphalet was not
there."I don't blame him for not wanting to fight for the Yankees," she said."Then why doesn't he fight for the South he asked"

"Fight for the South!""I reckon not, too," said the Colonel, dryly.For the following week curiosity prompted Virginia to take that walk
with the Colonel.Hopper being still absent, she helped him to sort
the papers--those grimy reminders of a more prosperous time gone
by.Carvel would run across one which seemed to bring some
incident to his mind; for he would drop it absently on his desk, his
hand seeking his chin, and remain for half an hour lost in thought.The Colonel answered
them all truthfully--generally with that dangerous suavity for which he
was noted.Twice a seedy man with a gnawed yellow mustache had come in
to ask Eliphalet's whereabouts.On the second occasion this individual
became importunate."You don't know nothin' about him, you say?""I 'low I kin 'lighten you a little.""Good day, sir," said the Colonel."I guess you'll like to hear what I've got to say."Carvel in his natural voice, "show this man out."Ford slunk out without Ephum's assistance.But he half turned at the
door, and shot back a look that frightened Virginia."Oh, Pa," she cried, in alarm, "what did he mean?""I couldn't tell you, Jinny," he answered.But she noticed that he was
very thoughtful as they walked home.The next morning Eliphalet had not
returned, but a corporal and guard were waiting to search the store for
him.The Colonel read the order, and invited them in with hospitality.He even showed them the way upstairs, and presently Virginia heard them
all tramping overhead among the bales.Her eye fell upon the paper they
had brought, which lay unfolded on her father's desk.It was signed
Stephen A. Brice, Enrolling Officer.That very afternoon they moved to Glencoe, and Ephum was left in sole
charge of the store.At Glencoe, far from the hot city and the cruel
war, began a routine of peace.Virginia was a child again, romping
in the woods and fields beside her father.The color came back to her
cheeks once more, and the laughter into her voice.The two of them, and
Ned and Mammy, spent a rollicking hour in the pasture the freedom
of which Dick had known so long, before the old horse was caught and
brought back into bondage.After that Virginia took long drives with her
father, and coming home, they would sit in the summer house high above
the Merimec, listening to the crickets' chirp, and watching the day fade
upon the water.The Colonel, who had always detested pipes, learned to
smoke a corncob.He would sit by the hour, with his feet on the rail of
the porch and his hat tilted back, while Virginia read to him.Poe
and Wordsworth and Scott he liked, but Tennyson was his favorite.One afternoon when Virginia was sitting in the summer house alone, her
thoughts wandering back, as they sometimes did, to another afternoon
she had spent there,--it seemed so long ago,--when she saw Mammy Easter
coming toward her."Honey, dey's comp'ny up to de house.He's
on de porch, talkin' to your Pa.In truth, the solid figure of Eliphalet himself was on the path some
twenty yards behind her.His hat was in his hand; his hair was plastered
down more neatly than ever, and his coat was a faultless and sober
creation of a Franklin Avenue tailor.He carried a cane, which was
unheard of.Virginia sat upright, and patted her skirts with a gesture
of annoyance--what she felt was anger, resentment.Suddenly she rose,
swept past Mammy, and met him ten paces from the summer house."How-dy-do, Miss Virginia," he cried pleasantly."Your father had a
notion you might be here."Her greeting would have frozen a man
of ardent temperament.But it was not precisely ardor that Eliphalet
showed.There was something in
the man's air to-day.Her words seemed to relieve some tension in him."Well, I did, first of all.You're considerable smart, Miss Jinny, but
I'll bet you can't tell me where I was, now.""I cal'lated it might interest you to know
how I dodged the Sovereign State of Missouri.General Halleck made an
order that released a man from enrolling on payment of ten dollars.Then I was drafted into the Abe Lincoln Volunteers; I paid a
substitute.And so here I be, exercising life, and liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.""If your substitute gets
killed, I suppose you will have cause for congratulation."Eliphalet laughed, and pulled down his cuffs."That's his lookout,
I cal'late," said he.He glanced at the girl in a way that made her
vaguely uneasy.She turned from him, back toward the summer house.Eliphalet's eyes smouldered as they rested upon her figure."I've heard considerable about the beauties of this place.Would you
mind showing me 'round a bit?"Not since that first evening in Locust Street had it taken on such
assurance, And yet she could not be impolite to a guest."Certainly not," she replied, but without looking up.He came to the summer house, glanced around it with apparent
satisfaction, and put his foot on the moss-grown step.She leaped quickly into the doorway before him, and
stood facing him, framed in the climbing roses.He drew back,
staring in astonishment at the crimson in her face.She had been groping
wildly for excuses, and found none."Because," she said, "because I ask you not to."With dignity: "That
should be sufficient.""Well," replied Eliphalet, with an abortive laugh, "that's funny, now.Womenkind get queer notions, which I cal'late we've got to respect and
put up with all our lives--eh?"Her anger flared at his leer and at his broad way of gratifying her
whim.And she was more incensed than ever at his air of being at
home--it was nothing less.She strove still to hide her
resentment."There is a walk along the bluff," she said, coldly, "where the view is
just as good."But she purposely drew him into the right-hand path, which led, after
a little, back to the house.Despite her pace he pressed forward to her
side."Miss Jinny," said he, precipitately, "did I ever strike you as a
marrying man?"Virginia stopped, and put her handkerchief to her face, the impulse
strong upon her to laugh.Eliphalet was suddenly transformed again into
the common commercial Yankee.He was in love, and had come to ask her
advice."I never thought of you as of the marrying kind, Mr.Hopper," she
answered, her voice quivering.Indeed, he was irresistibly funny as he stood hot and ill at ease.The
Sunday coat bore witness to his increasing portliness by creasing across
from the buttons; his face, fleshy and perspiring, showed purple veins,
and the little eyes receded comically, like a pig's."Well, I've been thinking serious of late about getting married," he
continued, slashing the rose bushes with his stick."I don't cal'late
to be a sentimental critter.I'm not much on high-sounding phrases, and
such things, but I'd give you my word I'd make a good husband.""Please be careful of those roses, Mr."Beg pardon," said Eliphalet.He began to lose track of his tenses--that
was the only sign he gave of perturbation.Louis
without a cent, Miss Jinny, I made up my mind I'd be a rich man before
I left it.If I was to die now, I'd have kept that promise.I'm not
thirty-four, and I cal'late I've got as much money in a safe place as a
good many men you call rich.I'm not saying what I've got, mind you.I've stopped chewing--there was a time when I
done that."That is all very commendable, Mr.Hopper," Virginia said, stifling a
rebellious titter."But,--but why did you give up chewing?""I am informed that the ladies are against it," said Eliphalet,--"dead
against it.You wouldn't like it in a husband, now, would you?"This time the laugh was not to be put down."I confess I shouldn't," she
said."Thought so," he replied, as one versed.His tones took on a nasal
twang."Well, as I was saying, I've about got ready to settle down, and
I've had my eye on the lady this seven years.""The lady," said Eliphalet, bluntly, "is you."He glanced at her
bewildered face and went on rapidly: "You pleased me the first day I set
eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for
you to marry.'I'm plain, but my folks was good people.I set to work
right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny.I'm a plain business man with no frills.You're the kind that was raised in the lap of luxury.You'll need a man
with a fortune, and a big one; you're the sort to show it off.I've got
the foundations of that fortune, and the proof of it right here.And I
tell you,"--his jaw was set,--"I tell you that some day Eliphalet Hopper
will be one of the richest men in the West."He had stopped, facing her in the middle of the way, his voice strong,
his confidence supreme.At first she had stared at him in dumb wonder.Then, as she began to grasp the meaning of his harangue, astonishment
was still dominant,--sheer astonishment.But,
as he finished, the thatch of the summer house caught her eye.A vision
arose of a man beside whom Eliphalet was not worthy to crawl.She
thought of Stephen as he had stood that evening in the sunset, and this
proposal seemed a degradation.But she caught the look on Eliphalet's
face, and she knew that he would not understand.This was one who
rose and fell, who lived and loved and hated and died and was buried
by--money.For a second she looked into his face as one who escapes a pit gazes
over the precipice, and shuddered.As for Eliphalet, let it not be
thought that he had no passion.This was the moment for which he had
lived since the day he had first seen her and been scorned in the store.That type of face, that air,--these were the priceless things he would
buy with his money.Crazed with the very violence of his long-pent
desire, he seized her hand.He staggered back, and stood for a moment motionless, as though stunned.Then, slowly, a light crept into his little eyes which haunted her for
many a day."You--won't--marry me?"exclaimed Virginia, her face burning with
the shame of it.She was standing with her hands behind her, her back
against a great walnut trunk, the crusted branches of which hung over
the bluff.Even as he looked at her, Eliphalet lost his head, and
indiscretion entered his soul.You've got no notion of my
money, I say."If you owned the whole of
California, I would not marry you."He
slipped his hand into a pocket, as one used to such a motion, and drew
out some papers."I cal'late you ain't got much idea of the situation, Miss Carvel," he
said; "the wheels have been a-turning lately.You're poor, but I guess
you don't know how poor you are,--eh?The Colonel's a man of honor,
ain't he?"For her life she could not have answered,--nor did she even know why she
stayed to listen."Well," he said, "after all, there ain't much use in your lookin' over
them papers.I'll tell you what they say: they
say that if I choose, I am Carvel & Company."The little eyes receded, and he waited a moment, seemingly to prolong a
physical delight in the excitement and suffering of a splendid creature."I cal'late you despise me, don't you?"he went on, as if that, too,
gave him pleasure."But I tell you the Colonel's a beggar but for me.All you've got to do is to say you'll be my
wife, and I tear these notes in two.(He
made the motion with his hands.)"Carvel & Company's an old firm,--a
respected firm.You wouldn't care to see it go out of the family, I
cal'late."But she did none of the things he expected.She said, simply:--"Will you please follow me, Mr.And he followed her,--his shrewdness gone, for once.Save for the rise and fall of her shoulders she seemed calm.The path
wound through a jungle of waving sunflowers and led into the shade in
front of the house.His
pipe lay with its scattered ashes on the boards, and his head was bent
forward, as though listening.When he saw the two, he rose expectantly,
and went forward to meet them."Pa," she said, "is it true that you have borrowed money from this man?"Carvel angry once, and his soul had quivered.Terror, abject terror, seized him now, so that his knees smote together.As well stare into the sun as into the Colonel's face.In one stride
he had a hand in the collar of Eliphalet's new coat, the other pointing
down the path."It takes just a minute to walk to that fence, sir," he said sternly."If you are any longer about it, I reckon you'll never get past it.Hopper's gait down the flagstones was
an invention of his own.It was neither a walk, nor a trot, nor a run,
but a sort of sliding amble, such as is executed in nightmares.Singing
in his head was the famous example of the eviction of Babcock from the
store,--the only time that the Colonel's bullet had gone wide.And down
in the small of his back Eliphalet listened for the crack of a pistol,
and feared that a clean hole might be bored there any minute.Once
outside, he took to the white road, leaving a trail of dust behind him
that a wagon might have raised.Fear lent him wings, but neglected to
lift his feet.The Colonel passed his arm around his daughter, and pulled his goatee
thoughtfully.And Virginia, glancing shyly upward, saw a smile in the
creases about his mouth: She smiled, too, and then the tears hid him
from her.Strange that the face which in anger withered cowards and made men look
grave, was capable of such infinite tenderness,--tenderness and sorrow.The Colonel took Virginia in his arms, and she sobbed against his
shoulder, as of old."Yes--"

"Lige was right, and--and you, Jinny--I should never have trusted him.The sun was slanting in yellow bars through
the branches of the great trees, and a robin's note rose above the bass
chorus of the frogs.In the pauses, as she listened, it seemed as if she
could hear the silver sound of the river over the pebbles far below."Honey," said the Colonel,--"I reckon we're just as poor as white
trash.""Honey," he said again, after a pause, "I must keep my word and let him
have the business.""There is a little left, a very little," he continued slowly, painfully.It was left you by Becky--by your mother.It is in a railroad company in New York, and safe, Jinny.""Oh, Pa, you know that I do not care," she cried."It shall be yours and
mine together.And we shall live out here and be happy."He was in his familiar
posture of thought, his legs slightly apart, his felt hat pushed back,
stroking his goatee.But his clear gray eyes were troubled as they
sought hers, and she put her hand to her breast."Virginia," he said, "I fought for my country once, and I reckon I'm
some use yet awhile.It isn't right that I should idle here, while
the South needs me, Your Uncle Daniel is fifty-eight, and Colonel of a
Pennsylvania regiment.--Jinny, I have to go."It was in her blood as well as his.The Colonel
had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay
flowers on her grave.She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that
his heart was rent at leaving her.She put her hands on his shoulders,
and he stooped to kiss her trembling lips.They walked out together to the summer-house, and stood watching the
glory of the light on the western hills."Jinn," said the Colonel, "I
reckon you will have to go to your Aunt Lillian.But I know that my girl can take care of herself.In case--in case I do
not come back, or occasion should arise, find Lige.Let him take you to
your Uncle Daniel.He is fond of you, and will be all alone in Calvert
House when the war is over.And I reckon that is all I have to say.I
won't pry into your heart, honey.I
like the boy, and I believe he will quiet down into a good man."Virginia did not answer, but reached out for her father's hand and held
its fingers locked tight in her own.From the kitchen the sound of Ned's
voice rose in the still evening air."Sposin' I was to go to N' Orleans an' take sick and die,
     Laik a bird into de country ma spirit would fly."And after a while down the path the red and yellow of Mammy Easter's
bandanna was seen.Laws, if I ain't ramshacked de premises fo' you
bof.De co'n bread's gittin' cold."That evening the Colonel and Virginia thrust a few things into her
little leather bag they had chosen together in London.Virginia had
found a cigar, which she hid until they went down to the porch, and
there she gave it to him; when he lighted the match she saw that his
hand shook.Half an hour later he held her in his arms at the gate, and she heard
his firm tread die in the dust of the road.WITH THE ARMIES OF THE WEST

We are at Memphis,--for a while,--and the Christmas season is
approaching once more.And yet we must remember that war recognizes no
Christmas, nor Sunday, nor holiday.The brown river, excited by rains,
whirled seaward between his banks of yellow clay.Now the weather was
crisp and cold, now hazy and depressing, and again a downpour.A spirit possessed the place, a restless
spirit called William T. Sherman.He prodded Memphis and laid violent
hold of her.She groaned, protested, turned over, and woke up, peopled
by a new people.When these walked, they ran, and they wore a blue
uniform.Rain nor heat nor
tempest kept them in.And yet they joked, and Memphis laughed (what was
left of her), and recognized a bond of fellowship.The General joked,
and the Colonels and the Commissary and the doctors, down to the sutlers
and teamsters and the salt tars under Porter, who cursed the dishwater
Mississippi, and also a man named Eads, who had built the new-fangled
iron boxes officially known as gunboats.The like of these had
never before been seen in the waters under the earth.The loyal
citizens--loyal to the South--had been given permission to leave the
city.The General told the assistant quartermaster to hire their houses
and slaves for the benefit of the Federal Government.Likewise he laid
down certain laws to the Memphis papers defining treason.He gave
out his mind freely to that other army of occupation, the army of
speculation, that flocked thither with permits to trade in cotton.The
speculators gave the Confederates gold, which they needed most, for the
bales, which they could not use at all.The forefathers of some of these gentlemen were in old Egypt under
Pharaoh--for whom they could have had no greater respect and fear than
their descendants had in New Egypt for Grant or Sherman.And a certain acquaintance of ours
materially added to his fortune by selling in Boston the cotton which
cost him fourteen cents, at thirty cents.One day the shouting and the swearing and the running to and fro came
to a climax.Those floating freaks which were all top and drew nothing,
were loaded down to the guards with army stores and animals and wood and
men,--men who came from every walk in life.Whistles bellowed, horses neighed.The gunboats chased hither and
thither, and at length the vast processions paddled down the stream with
naval precision, under the watchful eyes of a real admiral.Residents of Memphis from the river's bank watched the pillar of smoke
fade to the southward and ruminated on the fate of Vicksburg.A little later he wrote to the
Commander-in-Chief at Washington, "The valley of the Mississippi is
America."Vicksburg taken, this vast Confederacy would be chopped in two.Night fell to the music of the paddles, to the scent of the officers'
cigars, to the blood-red vomit of the tall stacks and the smoky flame of
the torches.Then Christmas Day dawned, and there was Vicksburg lifted
two hundred feet above the fever swamps, her court-house shining in
the morning sun.Vicksburg, the well-nigh impregnable key to America's
highway.When old Vick made his plantation on the Walnut Hills, he chose
a site for a fortress of the future Confederacy that Vauban would have
delighted in.Yes, there were the Walnut Hills, high bluffs separated from the
Mississippi by tangled streams and bayous, and on their crests the
Parrotts scowled.It was a queer Christmas Day indeed, bright and warm;
no snow, no turkeys nor mince pies, no wine, but just hardtack and bacon
and foaming brown water.On the morrow the ill-assorted fleet struggled up the sluggish Yazoo,
past impenetrable forests where the cypress clutched at the keels, past
long-deserted cotton fields, until it came at last to the black ruins of
a home.It spread out by brigade
and division and regiment and company, the men splashing and paddling
through the Chickasaw and the swamps toward the bluffs.The Parrotts
began to roar.A certain regiment, boldly led, crossed the bayou at a
narrow place and swept resistless across the sodden fields to where the
bank was steepest.The fire from the battery scorched the hair of their
heads.But there they stayed, scooping out the yellow clay with torn
hands, while the Parrotts, with lowered muzzles, ploughed the <DW72> with
shells.There they stayed, while the blue lines quivered and fell back
through the forests on that short winter's afternoon, dragging their
wounded from the stagnant waters.But many were left to die in agony in
the solitude.Like a tall emblem of energy, General Sherman stood watching the attack
and repulse, his eyes ever alert.He paid no heed to the shells which
tore the limbs from the trees about him, or sent the swamp water in
thick spray over his staff.Now and again a sharp word broke from his
lips, a forceful home thrust at one of the leaders of his columns."Sixth Missouri, General," said an aide, promptly.The General sat late in the Admiral's gunboat that night, but when
he returned to his cabin in the Forest Queen, he called for a list of
officers of the Sixth Missouri.His finger slipping down the roll paused
at a name among the new second lieutenants."Yes, General, when it fell dark.""Let me see the casualties,--quick."That night a fog rolled up from the swamps, and in the morning
jack-staff was hid from pilot-house.Before the attack could be renewed,
a political general came down the river with a letter in his pocket
from Washington, by virtue of which he took possession of the three army
core, and their chief, subpoenaed the fleet and the Admiral, and went
off to capture Arkansas Post.Three weeks later, when the army was resting at Napoleon, Arkansas, a
self-contained man, with a brown beard arrived from Memphis, and took
command.He smoked incessantly in his
cabin.He had look in his face that
boded ill to any that might oppose him.Time and labor be counted
as nothing, compared with the accomplishment of an object.Back to
Vicksburg paddled the fleet and transports.Across the river from the
city, on the pasty mud behind the levee's bank were dumped Sherman's
regiments, condemned to week of ditch-digging, that the gunboats might
arrive at the bend of the Mississippi below by a canal, out of reach of
the batteries.Day in and day out they labored, officer and men.Sawing
off stumps under the water, knocking poisonous snakes by scores from the
branches, while the river rose and rose and rose, and the rain crept
by inches under their tent flies, and the enemy walked the parapet of
Vicksburg and laughed.Two gunboats accomplished the feat of running the
batteries, that their smiles might be sobered.To the young officers who were soiling their uniform with the grease of
saws, whose only fighting was against fever and water snakes, the news
of an expedition into the Vicksburg side of the river was hailed with
caps in the air.To be sure, the saw and axe, and likewise the levee and
the snakes, were to be there, too.But there was likely to be a little
fighting.The rest of the corps that was to stay watched grimly as the
detachment put off in the little 'Diligence' and 'Silver Wave'.All the night the smoke-pipes were batting against the boughs of oak and
cottonwood, and snapping the trailing vines.Some other regiments
went by another route.The ironclads, followed in hot haste by General
Sherman in a navy tug, had gone ahead, and were even then shoving with
their noses great trunks of trees in their eagerness to get behind the
Rebels.The Missouri regiment spread out along the waters, and were soon
waist deep, hewing a path for the heavier transports to come.Presently
the General came back to a plantation half under water, where Black
Bayou joins Deer Creek, to hurry the work in cleaning out that Bayou.The light transports meanwhile were bringing up more troops from a
second detachment.All through the Friday the navy great guns were
heard booming in the distance, growing quicker and quicker, until
the quivering air shook the hanging things in that vast jungle.Saws
stopped, and axes were poised over shoulders, and many times that day
the General lifted his head anxiously.As he sat down in the evening in
a slave cabin redolent with corn pone and bacon, the sound still hovered
among the trees and rolled along the still waters.It was three o'clock Saturday morning when
the sharp challenge of a sentry broke the silence.A <DW64>, white eyed,
bedraggled, and muddy, stood in the candle light under the charge of a
young lieutenant.The officer saluted, and handed the General a roll of
tobacco."I found this man in the swamp, sir.He has a message from the
Admiral--"

The General tore open the roll and took from it a piece of tissue paper
which he spread out and held under the candle.He turned to a staff
officer who had jumped from his bed and was hurrying into his coat."Kilby Smith
and all men here across creek to relief at once.I'll take canoe through
bayou to Hill's and hurry reenforcements."The staff officer paused, his hand on the latch of the door.You're not going through that sewer in a
canoe without an escort!""I guess they won't look for a needle in that haystack," the General
answered."Get back to your
regiment, Brice, if you want to go," he said.All through the painful march that
followed, though soaked in swamp water and bruised by cypress knees, he
thought of Sherman in his canoe, winding unprotected through the black
labyrinth, risking his life that more men might be brought to the rescue
of the gunboats.The story of that rescue has been told most graphically by Sherman
himself.How he picked up the men at work on the bayou and marched them
on a coal barge; how he hitched the barge to a navy tug; how he met the
little transport with a fresh load of troops, and Captain Elijah Brent's
reply when the General asked if he would follow him."As long as the
boat holds together, General."The boughs hammered
at the smoke-pipes until they went by the board, and the pilothouse fell
like a pack of cards on the deck before they had gone three miles and a
half.Then the indomitable Sherman disembarked, a lighted candle in his
hand, and led a stiff march through thicket and swamp and breast-deep
backwater, where the little drummer boys carried their drums on their
heads.At length, when they were come to some Indian mounds, they found
a picket of three, companies of the force which had reached the flat the
day before, and had been sent down to prevent the enemy from obstructing
further the stream below the fleet."The Admiral's in a bad way, sir," said the Colonel who rode up to meet
the General.Those clumsy ironclads of his can't move
backward or forward, and the Rebs have been peppering him for two days."Just then a fusillade broke from the thickets, nipping the branches from
the cottonwoods about them.The force swept forward, with the three picket companies in the swamp on
the right.And presently they came in sight of the shapeless ironclads
with their funnels belching smoke, a most remarkable spectacle.How
Porter had pushed them there was one of the miracles of the war.Then followed one of a thousand memorable incidents in the life of a
memorable man.General Sherman, jumping on the bare back of a scrawny
horse, cantered through the fields.And the bluejackets, at sight of
that familiar figure, roared out a cheer that might have shaken the
drops from the wet boughs.The Admiral and the General stood together on
the deck, their hands clasped.And the Colonel astutely remarked, as he
rode up in answer to a summons, that if Porter was the only man whose
daring could have pushed a fleet to that position, Sherman was certainly
the only man who could have got him out of it."Colonel," said the General, "that move was well executed, sir.Admiral,
did the Rebs put a bullet through your rum casks?And now," he added, wheeling on the Colonel when each had a glass
in his hand, "who was in command of that company on the right, in the
swamp?"He's a second lieutenant, General, in the Sixth Missouri.Captain
wounded at Hindman, and first lieutenant fell out down below.His name
is Brice, I believe."Some few days afterward, when the troops were slopping around again at
Young's Point, opposite Vicksburg, a gentleman arrived on a boat
from St.He paused on the levee to survey with concern and
astonishment the flood of waters behind it, and then asked an officer
the way to General Sherman's headquarters.The officer, who was greatly
impressed by the gentleman's looks, led him at once to a trestle bridge
which spanned the distance from the levee bank over the flood to a house
up to its first floor in the backwaters.The officer looked inquiringly at the gentleman, who gave his name.The officer could not repress a smile at the next thing that happened.Out hurried the General himself, with both hands outstretched.he cried, "if it isn't Brinsmade.Come right in, come
right in and take dinner.I'll send
and tell Grant you're here.Brinsmade, if it wasn't for you and your
friends on the Western Sanitary Commission, we'd all have been dead of
fever and bad food long ago.""I guess a
good many of the boys are laid up now," he added."I've come down to do what I can, General," responded Mr."I want to go through all the hospitals to see that our nurses
are doing their duty and that the stores are properly distributed.""You shall, sir, this minute," said the General.He dropped instantly
the affairs which he had on hand, and without waiting for dinner the
two gentlemen went together through the wards where the fever raged.The
General surprised his visitor by recognizing private after private in
the cots, and he always had a brief word of cheer to brighten their
faces, to make them follow him with wistful eyes as he passed beyond
them."That's poor Craig," he would say, "corporal, Third Michigan.They
tell me he can't live," and "That's Olcott, Eleventh Indiana.cried the General, when they were out in the air again, "how I wish
some of these cotton traders could get a taste of this fever.They keep
well--the vultures--And by the way, Brinsmade, the man who gave me no
peace at all at Memphis was from your city.Why, I had to keep a whole
corps on duty to watch him."As long as
I live I shall never forget it."He has always seemed
inoffensive, and I believe he is a prominent member of one of our
churches.""I guess that's so," answered the General, dryly."I ever I set eyes on
him again, he's clapped into the guardhouse.Brinsmade, presently, "have
you ever heard of Stephen Brice?You may
remember talking to him one evening at my house."He
paused on the very brink of relating again the incident at Camp Jackson,
when Stephen had saved the life of Mr."Brinsmade,
for three days I've had it on my mind to send for that boy.I like him," cried General Sherman, with tone
and gesture there was no mistaking.Brinsmade, who liked
Stephen, too, rejoiced at the story he would have to tell the widow."He
has spirit, Brinsmade.I told him to let me know when he was ready to go
to war.The first thing I hear of
him is that he's digging holes in the clay of Chickasaw Bluff, and his
cap is fanned off by the blast of a Parrott six feet above his head.Next thing he turns up on that little expedition we took to get Porter
to sea again.When we got to the gunboats, there was Brice's company
on the flank.He handled those men surprisingly, sir--surprisingly.I
shouldn't have blamed the boy if one or two Rebs got by him.But no, he
swept the place clean."By this time they had come back to the bridge
leading to headquarters, and the General beckoned quickly to an orderly."My compliments to Lieutenant Stephen Brice, Sixth Missouri, and ask him
to report here at once.Brice's company were swinging axes when the
orderly arrived, and Mr.Brice had an axe himself, and was up to his
boot tops in yellow mud.The orderly, who had once been an Iowa farmer, was near grinning when he
gave the General's message and saw the lieutenant gazing ruefully at his
clothes.Entering headquarters, Stephen paused at the doorway of the big room
where the officers of the different staffs were scattered about,
smoking, while the <DW64> servants were removing the dishes from the
table.The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced
on the ceiling.At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform,
as always, a trifle awry.His soft felt hat with the gold braid was
tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed.Small
wonder that the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in
Sherman.The sound that had caught Stephen's attention was the General's voice,
somewhat high-pitched, in the key that he used in telling a story."Sin gives you a pretty square deal, boys, after all.Generally a man
says, 'Well, I can resist, but I'll have my fun just this once.'Stephen made his way to the General, whose bright eyes wandered rapidly
over him as he added:

"This is the condition my officers report in, Brinsmade,--mud from head
to heel."Stephen had sense enough to say nothing, but the staff officers laughed,
and Mr.Brinsmade smiled as he rose and took Stephen's hand."I am delighted to see that you are well, sir," said he, with that
formal kindliness which endeared him to all."Your mother will be
rejoiced at my news of you.You will be glad to hear that I left her
well, Stephen.""They are well, sir, and took pleasure in adding to a little box which
your mother sent.Judge Whipple put in a box of fine cigars, although he
deplores the use of tobacco.""He is ailing, sir, it grieves me to say.Your mother desired to have him moved to her house,
but he is difficult to stir from his ways, and he would not leave his
little room.We have got old Nancy, Hester's mother,
to stay with him at night, and Mrs.Brice divides the day with Miss
Jinny Carvel, who comes in from Bellegarde every afternoon."exclaimed Stephen, wondering if he heard aright.And at
the mention of her name he tingled."She has been much honored
for it.You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her
father's before the war.And--well, they quarrelled, sir."When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr.The
thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely
sweet."Two days before I left, sir, Dr.Polk had warned him not to do so much.But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms."Brinsmade how long he was to be with them."I am going on to the other camps this afternoon," said he."But I
should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite
me.Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr.Whipple,
and--your many friends in St."You will find my tent a little wet, air," replied Stephen, touched.Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very
curious expression, spoke up."That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!"Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to
Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the
package from home.But presently, while they sat talking of many things,
the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who
should come stooping in but General Sherman himself.He sat down on a
cracker box."Well, well, Brice," said the General, winking at Mr.Brinsmade, "I
think you might have invited me to the feast.The General chose one and lighted
it."Why, yes, sir, when I can.""Then light up, sir," said the General, "and sit down, I've been
thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round
and talk it over with you first.That isn't strictly according to
the rules of the service."They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer."You were in the Home Guards, if I
remember right.Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways
What was your rank in the Home Guards?""A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.""Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?"Brinsmade spoke up, "They offered him
a lieutenant-colonelcy."The General was silent a moment: Then he said "Do you remember meeting
me on the boat when I was leaving St.Louis, after the capture of Fort
Henry?""Very well, General," he replied, General Sherman leaned
forward."And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come
into this war, let me know.'Then he said gravely, but with just a
suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- "General, if I had done that, you
wouldn't be here in my tent to-day."Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's
shoulder."By gad, sir," he cried, delighted, "so I wouldn't."A STRANGE MEETING

The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure
turned into success, by which man is made immortal.It involves the
history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither
for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise
with equanimity.Through month after month of discouragement, and work
gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal.And
by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and
suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports
swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river.The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the
sound over the empty swamp land.Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a
base--unheard of.Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the
country clear of forage.Confederate generals in
Mississippi were bewildered.One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen
Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore.Sitting together on
a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted.That one
talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman.The impassive profile
of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that
seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain
Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not
changed a whit.Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by,
artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their
plaudits.At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where
the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by
the rains, and flung up in great mounds.Stripped of the green magnolias
and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness,
save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood
tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out
below.First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous
repulse.Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs
into the redoubts, and three times were driven back.Then the blue army
settled into the earth and folded into the ravines.Three days in that
narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold
agonies in the moist heat.Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring
back what was left of the living.Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks
beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges.The big
shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could
be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of
smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and
deepening it by day, for officers and men alike.From heaven a host of
blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along
the rude water-cuts and through the hills.A waiting carrion from her
vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants
disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down
the trench,--each with his ball of clay.In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the
ground beneath the besieged.Counter mines were started, and through the
narrow walls of earth commands and curses came.Above ground the saps
were so near that a strange converse became the rule.Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and
the other for hardtack and bacon.These necessities were tossed across,
sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white
side of a homely green wall paper.At other times other amenities were
indulged in.Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses
rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who
replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens
of Vicksburg were eating mule meat.Not an officer or private in the
Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour
of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat.Silently the long blue files
wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the
enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the
Jackson road should rise heavenwards.By common consent the rifle
crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent.Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not
the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days.This was
the stillness of the death prayer.Eyes staring at the big redoubt were
dimmed.At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.The sun was darkened, and a hot
blast fanned the upturned faces.In the sky, through the film of
shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as
arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron.Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty
thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the
crater's edge.Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust!Men who ran
across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon
tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on
a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at
Vicksburg.Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the
Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past.As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old
into the hands of another.Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she
had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely.He had ceased to think
or care about Fortune.And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.They noted the friendly greeting
of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner
biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and
gone.The South saw her General turn on his heel.Both sides honored him for the fight he had made.But war
does not reward a man according to his deserts.The next day--the day our sundered nation was born Vicksburg
surrendered: the obstinate man with the mighty force had conquered.See
the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds
of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last.Silently, too, the
blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces.The arms
are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when
the counting is finished.The formations melt away, and those who for
months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk.The
coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke
quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a
wistful look into the gaunt faces.Tears stand in the eyes of many a man
as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday
of their country.Stephen Brice, now a captain in General
Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter
from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from
afar.Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its
face blown away.On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old
four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the
tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the
foot.So much for one of the navy's shells.While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was
acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and
with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry.Gallantly giving her
his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him
good by with much feeling.With an impulsive movement he drew some money
from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that
he might not listen to her thanks.Such was his preoccupation that
he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree."Excuse me, seh," he said contritely."Certainly," said Stephen, smiling; "it was my fault for getting in your
way.""Not at all, seh," said the cavalry Colonel; "my clumsiness, seh."He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long
mustache."Damn you Yankees," he continued, in the same amiable tone,
"you've brought us a heap of misfortune.Why, seh, in another week we'd
been fo'ced to eat <DW65>s."The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of
himself.He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his
attempt to cover it.The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card.The face was scant, perchance from lack
of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray.He
wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so
that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him."Captain," he said, taking in Stephen's rank, "so we won't qua'l as to
who's host heah.One thing's suah," he added, with a twinkle, "I've been
heah longest.Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children
down in the Palmetto State.I can't offer you a dinner, seh.We've
eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town."(His eye seemed to
interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.)"But I can offer
you something choicer than you have in the No'th."Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask.The Colonel
remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms."Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army.My name is
Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh," he said."You have
the advantage of me, Captain.""My name is Brice," said Stephen.The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and
thereupon unscrewed the flask.Now Stephen had never learned to like
straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face.The exploit
seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor
justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with
still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together.Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which
his new friend gave unqualified praise.On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage.Houses with gaping
chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees
felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed
across from curb to fence."Lordy I how my ears ache since your
damned coehorns have stopped.The noise got to be silence with us, seh,
and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust.Tell me," said he
"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a <DW65>
came down in your lines alive."Yes," said Stephen, smiling; "he struck near the place where my company
was stationed."I reckon he fell on it," said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a
matter of no special note."And now tell me something," said Stephen."How did you burn our
sap-rollers?"This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter."Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough," he cried."Some ingenious
cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore
musket."The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily."Explosive
bullets!--Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps.Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh?Three of our
officers--dare-devils, seh--floated down the Mississippi on logs.One
fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand.He's the pride of
our Vicksburg army.A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope
man.The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to
your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses
in De Soto, that we might see to shoot.And then he came back in the
face of our own batteries and your guns.That man was wounded by a trick
of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his
dinner in Vicksburg.He's pretty low, now, poor fellow," added the
Colonel, sadly.demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man."Well, he ain't a great ways from here," said the Colonel."Perhaps you
might be able to do something for him," he continued thoughtfully."I'd
hate to see him die.The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get
care and good air and good food."He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce
grip."No," said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, "you don't look
like the man to fool."Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his
former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge,
where the street ran between high banks of clay.There Stephen saw the
magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard.But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby
Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked.A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay.Carpet was stretched
on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture.There was
a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed,
beside which a middle-aged lady was seated.She had a kindly face which
seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture
of restraint.She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the
angles of a wasted frame.said the lady,--"it is the first time in two days that he has
slept."But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start.The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more
handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit
burned.For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he
dragged himself to the wall.The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, "does he look as
bad as that?"I--I know him," answered Stephen.He stepped quickly to the bedside,
and bent over it."This is too much, Jennison," came from the bed a voice that was
pitifully weak; "why do you bring Yankees in here?""Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax," said the Colonel, tugging
at his mustache.I have met Captain Colfax--"

"Colonel, sir.""Colonel Colfax, before the war!And if he would like to go to St.Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once."In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was
passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor
from a Yankee.He wondered whether there was in this case a special
detestation.And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the
memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights.Virginia
had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure.But now,--now
that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was
unfortunate--Stephen sighed.His comfort was that he would be the
instrument.The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the
sick man.From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that
seemed to rouse him.And then, with
some vehemence, "What is he doing in Vicksburg?"Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced."The city has surrendered," said that officer."Then you can afford to be generous," he said, with a bitter laugh."But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal.Jennison," he cried,
"Jennison, why in hell did you give up?""Colfax," said Stephen, coming forward, "you're too sick a man to talk.It may be that I can have you sent North
to-day.""You can do as you please," said Clarence, coldly, "with a--prisoner."Bowing to the lady, he strode out of
the room.Colonel Jennison, running after him, caught him in the street."He's sick--and God Almighty,
he's proud--I reckon," he added with a touch of humility that went
straight to Stephen's heart."I reckon that some of us are too derned
proud--But we ain't cold."And I hope, Colonel, that we may meet
again--as friends.""Hold on, seh," said Colonel Catesby Jennison; "we
may as well drink to that."Fortunately, as Stephen drew near the Court House, he caught sight of
a group of officers seated on its steps, and among them he was quick to
recognize General Sherman."Brice," said the General, returning his salute, "been celebrating this
glorious Fourth with some of our Rebel friends?""Yes, sir," answered Stephen, "and I came to ask a favor for one of
them."Seeing that the General's genial, interested expression did not
change, he was emboldened to go on."This is one of their colonels, sir.He is the man who floated down the river on a
log and brought back two hundred thousand percussion caps--"

"Good Lord," interrupted the General, "I guess we all heard of him after
that.What else has he done to endear himself?""Well, General, he rowed across the river in a skiff the night we ran
these batteries, and set fire to De Soto to make targets for their
gunners.""I'd like to see that man," said the General, in his eager way."What I was going to tell you, sir.After he went through all this, he
was hit by a piece of mortar shell, while sitting at his dinner.He's
rather far gone now, General, and they say he can't live unless he can
be sent North.I--I know who he is in St.And I thought that as
long as the officers are to be paroled I might get your permission to
send him up to-day.""I know the breed," said he, "I'll bet he didn't
thank you.""I like his grit," said the General, emphatically, "These young bloods
are the backbone of this rebellion, Brice.They
never did anything except horse-racing and cock-fighting.They ride like
the devil, fight like the devil, but don't care a picayune for anything.And, good Lord, how
they hate a Yankee!He's a cousin of that
fine-looking girl Brinsmade spoke of.Be a
pity to disappoint her--eh?""Why, Captain, I believe you would like to marry her yourself!Take my
advice, sir, and don't try to tame any wildcats.""I'm glad to do a favor for that young man," said the General, when
Stephen had gone off with the slip of paper he had given him."I like to
do that kind of a favor for any officer, when I can.Did you notice how
he flared up when I mentioned the girl?"This is why Clarence Colfax found himself that evening on a hospital
steamer of the Sanitary Commission, bound north for St.BELLEGARDE ONCE MORE

Supper at Bellegarde was not the simple meal it had been for a year past
at Colonel Carvel's house in town.Colfax was proud of her table,
proud of her fried chickens and corn fritters and her desserts.How
Virginia chafed at those suppers, and how she despised the guests whom
her aunt was in the habit of inviting to some of them!And when none
was present, she was forced to listen to Mrs.Colfax's prattle about the
fashions, her tirades against the Yankees."I'm sure he must be dead," said that lady, one sultry evening in July.Her tone, however, was not one of conviction.A lazy wind from the river
stirred the lawn of Virginia's gown.The girl, with her hand on the
wicker back of the chair, was watching a storm gather to the eastward,
across the Illinois prairie."I don't see why you say that, Aunt Lillian," she replied."Bad news
travels faster than good."It is cruel of him not to send us a line,
telling us where his regiment is."She had long since learned that the wisdom of
silence was the best for her aunt's unreasonableness.Certainly, if
Clarence's letters could not pass the close lines of the Federal troops,
news of her father's Texas regiment could not come from Red River."How was Judge Whipple to-day?"Brice,--isn't that her name?--doesn't take him to
her house.Virginia began to rock slowly, and her foot tapped the porch.Brice has begged the Judge to come to her.But he says he has
lived in those rooms, and that he will die there,--when the time comes."You have become quite a Yankee
yourself, I believe, spending whole days with her, nursing that old
man.""The Judge is an old friend of my father's; I think he would wish it,"
replied the girl, in a lifeless voice.Her speech did not reveal all the pain and resentment she felt.She
thought of the old man racked with pain and suffering in the heat, lying
patient on his narrow bed, the only light of life remaining the presence
of the two women.They came day by day, and often Margaret Brice had
taken the place of the old negress who sat with him at night.Yes, it was worship; it had been worship since the
day she and her father had gone to the little whitewashed hospital.Providence had brought them together at the Judge's bedside.The
marvellous quiet power of the older woman had laid hold of the girl in
spite of all barriers.Often when the Judge's pain was eased sufficiently for him to talk, he
would speak of Stephen.The mother never spoke of her son, but a light
would come into her eyes at this praise of him which thrilled Virginia
to see.And when the good lady was gone, and the Judge had fallen into
slumber, it would still haunt her.Was it out of consideration for her that Mrs.Brice would turn the Judge
from this topic which he seemed to love best?Virginia could not admit
to herself that she resented this.She had heard Stephen's letters to
the Judge.Strong and manly they were, with plenty
of praises for the Southern defenders of Vicksburg.Only yesterday
Virginia had read one of these to Mr.Well
that his face was turned to the window, and that Stephen's mother was
not there!"He says very little about himself," Mr."Had it
not been for Brinsmade, we should never know that Sherman had his eye on
him, and had promoted him.We should never have known of that exploit
at Chickasaw Bluff.But what a glorious victory was Grant's capture of
Vicksburg, on the Fourth of July!I guess we'll make short work of the
Rebels now."No, the Judge had not changed much, even in illness.Virginia laid the letter down, and tears started to her eyes as
she repressed a retort.It was not the first time this had happened.How strange
that, with all his thought of others, he should fall short here!One day, after unusual forbearance, Mrs.Brice had overtaken Virginia
on the stairway.Well she knew the girl's nature, and how difficult she
must have found repression."My dear," she had said, "you are a wonderful woman."But
Virginia had driven back to Bellegarde with a strange elation in her
heart.Some things the Judge had forborne to mention, and for this Virginia was
thankful.But she had overheard Shadrach telling old
Nancy how Mrs.Brice had pleaded with him to move it, that he might have
more room and air.And Colonel Carvel's name had
never once passed his lips.Many a night the girl had lain awake listening to the steamboats as they
toiled against the river's current, while horror held her.Horror lest
her father at that moment be in mortal agony amongst the heaps left by
the battle's surges; heaps in which, like mounds of ashes, the fire was
not yet dead.Fearful tales she had heard in the prison hospitals of
wounded men lying for days in the Southern sun between the trenches at
Vicksburg, or freezing amidst the snow and sleet at Donelson.What a life had been
Colonel Carvel's!Another, and he had lost his fortune, his home, his friends, all that
was dear to him.And that daughter, whom he loved best in all the world,
he was perchance to see no more.Colfax, yawning, had taken a book and gone to bed.Still Virginia
sat on the porch, while the frogs sang of rain, and the lightning
quivered across the eastern sky.She heard the crunch of wheels in the
gravel.A bar of light, peopled by moths, slanted out of the doorway and fell
on a closed carriage."Your cousin Clarence has come home, my dear," he said."He was among
the captured at Vicksburg, and is paroled by General Grant."Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia's choice of
her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,
had drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia
herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke
of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best
friend were a Yankee--"

Judge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of
the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I
guess you don't understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last
of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of
letting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though
devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence
gave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;
or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of
the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the
roses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this
merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through
which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and
comforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the
brightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen
gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the
graceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers
everywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,
there was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all
laughter.He said it over to himself
many, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes
upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded
her face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,
as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she
did not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who
were gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling
for her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the
war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very
like it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not
give them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,
imploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love
him, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives
together, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence
Colfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power
of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to
heights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the
mistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly
miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had
she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain
times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison
Colfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission
to send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow
came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's
report that he was fit for duty once more.He
was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport
Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from
Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the
Confederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men
who made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and
the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and
yet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness
of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the
corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still
in its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and
Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his
white head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his
southward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to
take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were
standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around
the corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear
him.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so
dear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is
there, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob
de light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the
four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the
lawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found
his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier
who brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up
to see me."He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am.I
reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned
and <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage
was flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under
the spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his
cousin's face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed
intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the
bushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner
of the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage
stopped.Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card
figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court
House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway
which led to the Judge's rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,
flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's
arms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the
Yankees catch you--"

"They won't catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her
out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she
searched his own."I'm not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was
nearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a
man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and
heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist.He's the oldest friend
I've got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"

"Pa, you've been in battle?""And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a
while: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last
through the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up
everything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son
came home.She is a noble woman--"

"Her son?"Silas has done nothing
the last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before
he dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked
down at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around
the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,
"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see
if he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she
might have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing
beside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny.He was
a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,
pos' has'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the
stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps
Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open
the door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I
reckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am
afraid they are watching the place.""I don't think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after
dark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her
father's sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have
dragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long
he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an
eternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel
stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these
many years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give
you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no
other reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was
dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"

Mr.How many men do you think would risk their
lives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now
die happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I
thank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me
to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I
hope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were
dying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not
leave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in
this world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so
much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent.And
how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield
covered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father's arm as they
leaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of
the night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those
who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the
flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for
a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes.Of the old days,
of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her
father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how
sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose
and say:

"It's my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn
that he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon
this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard
that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She
wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only
one who had ever been known to break the Judge's will.Virginia's
eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,
smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers,
but not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and
softened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up
from the Judge's face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,
and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between
mother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought
of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence
from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from
the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk
in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line
of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf
on Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached
out and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a
high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other
side of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was
his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man
who lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."And of such who having reason and
modesty enough to judg that they are less able to distinguish truth from
falshood then others, from whom they may receive instruction, ought much
rather to be content to follow other Mens opinions, rather then to seek
after better themselves.And for my part, I had undoubtedly been of the number of those latter,
had I never had but one Master, or had I not known the disputes which
have alwayes hapned amongst the most learned.For having learnt from
the very School, That one can imagin nothing so strange or incredible,
which had not been said by some one of the Philosophers; And having
since observ'd in my travails, That all those whose opinions are
contrary to ours, are not therefore barbarous or savage, but that many
use as much or more reason then we; and having consider'd how much one
Man with his own understanding, bred up from his childhood among the
French or the Dutch, becomes different from what he would be, had he
alwayes liv'd amongst the _Chineses_, or the _Cannibals_: And how even
in the fashion of our Clothes, the same thing which pleas'd ten years
since, and which perhaps wil please ten years hence, seems now to us
ridiculous and extravagant.So that it's much more Custome and Example
which perswades us, then any assured knowledg; and notwithstanding that
plurality of voices is a proof of no validity, in those truths which
are hard to be discovered; for that it's much more likely for one man
alone to have met with them, then a whole Nation; I could choose no Man
whose opinion was to be preferr'd before anothers: And I found my self
even constrain'd to undertake the conduct of my self.But as a man that walks alone, and in the dark, I resolv'd to goe so
softly, and use so much circumspection in all things, that though I
advanc'd little, I would yet save my self from falling.Neither would I
begin quite to reject, some opinions, which formerly had crept into my
belief, without the consent of my reason, before I had employed time
enough to form the project of the work I undertook, and to seek the true
Method to bring me to the knowledg of all those things, of which my
understanding was capable.I had a little studyed, being young, of the parts of Philosophy, Logick,
and of the Mathematicks, the Analysis of the Geometricians, and
_Algebra_: Three arts or sciences which seem'd to contribute somewhat
conducing to my designe: But examining them, I observ'd, That as for
Logick, its Sylogisms, and the greatest part of its other Rules, serve
rather to expound to another the things they know, or even as _Lullies_
art, to speak with judgment of the things we are ignorant of, then to
learn them.And although in effect it contain divers most true and good
precepts, yet there are so many others mixed amongst them, either
hurtfull or superfluous, That it's even as difficult to extract them, as
'tis to draw a _Diana_ or a _Mercury_ out of a lump of Marble, which is
not yet rough-hewn; as for the Analysis of the Ancients, and the
_Algebra_ of the Moderns; besides that, they extend only to matters very
abstract, and which seem to be of no use; The first being alwayes so
tyed to the consideration of figures, That it cannot exercise the
understanding, without very much tiring the imagination.And in the
latter they have so subjected themselves to certain Rules and cyphers,
that they have made a confus'd and obscure art which perplexeth the
minde, in stead of a Science to instruct it.For this reason, I thought
I ought to seek some other Method, which comprehending the advantages of
these, they might be exempt from their defects.And as the multitude of
Laws often furnisheth excuses for vice; so a State is fair better
polic'd, when having but a few, they are very strictly observ'd therein:
So, instead of the great many precepts whereof Logick is compos'd, I
thought these four following would be sufficient for me, if I took but a
firm and constant resolution not once to fail in the observation of
them.The first was, never to receive any thing for true, but what I evidently
knew to be so; that's to say, Carefully to avoid Precipitation and
Prevention, and to admit nothing more into my judgment, but what should
so clearly and distinctly present it self to my minde, that I could have
no reason to doubt of it.The second, to divide every One of these difficulties, which I was to
examine into as many parcels as could be, and, as was requisite the
better to resolve them.The third, to lead my thoughts in order, beginning by the most simple
objects, and the easiest to be known; to rise by little and little, as
by steps, even to the knowledg of the most mixt; and even supposing an
Order among those which naturally doe not precede one the other.And the last, to make every where such exact calculations, and such
generall reviews, That I might be confident to have omitted Nothing.Those long chains of reasons, (though simple and easie) which the
Geometricians commonly use to lead us to their most difficult
demonstrations, gave me occasion to imagine, That all things which may
fall under the knowledg of Men, follow one the other in the same manner,
and so we doe only abstain from receiving any one for true, which is not
so, and observe alwayes the right order of deducing them one from the
other, there can be none so remote, to which at last we shall not
attain; nor so hid, which we shall not discover.Neither was I much
troubled to seek by which it behooved me to begin, for I already knew,
that it was by the most simple, and the easiest to be discern'd.But
considering, that amongst all those who formerly have sought the Truth
in Learning, none but the Mathematicians only could finde any
demonstrations, that's to say, any certain and evident reasons.I
doubted not, but that it was by the same that they have examin'd;
although I did hope for no other profit, but only that they would
accustome my Minde to nourish it self with Truths, and not content it
self with false Reasons.But for all this, I never intended to endevour
to learn all those particular Sciences which we commonly call'd
Mathematicall; And perceiving, that although their objects were
different, yet did they nevertheless agree altogether, in that they
consider no other thing, but the divers relations or proportions which
are found therein; I thought it therefore better to examine those
proportions in generall, and without supporting them but in those
subjects, which might the more easily serve to bring me to the knowledg
of them.But withall, without any wayes limiting them, That I might
afterwards the better sit them to all others whereto they might be
applyed.Having also observ'd, That to know them, it would be sometimes
needfull for me to consider every one in particular, or sometimes only
to restrain them, or comprehend many together; I thought, that to
consider them the better in particular I ought to suppose them in
lines, for as much as I find nothing more simple, nor which I could more
distinctly represent to my imagination, and to my sences; But to hold or
comprehend many in one, I was oblig'd to explain them by certain Cyphers
the shortest I possibly could, and that I should thereby borrow the best
of the Geometricall Analysis, and of Algebra, & so correct all the
defects of the one by the other.As in effect I dare say, That the exact observation of those few
precepts I had chosen, gave me such a facility to resolve all the
questions whereto these two sciences extend; That in two or three months
space which I employed in the examination of them, having begun by the
most simple and most generall, and every Truth which I found being a
rule which afterwards served me to discover others; I did not only
compasse divers truths which I had formerly judged most difficult, But
me thought also that towards the end I could determin even in those
which I was ignorant of, by what means and how farr it was possible to
resolve them.Wherein perhaps I shall not appear to be very vain if you
consider, That there being but one truth of every thing, who ever finds
it, knows as much of it as one can know; And that for example a child
instructed in Arithmatick having made an addition according to his
rules, may be sure to have found, touching the sum he examined, all what
the wit of man could finde out.In a word the method which teacheth to
folow a right order, and exactly to enumerate all the circumstances of
what we seek, contains, whatsoever ascertains the rules of Arithmatick.But that which pleas'd me most in this Method was the assurance I had,
wholly to use my reason, if not perfectly, at least as much as it was in
my power; Besides this, I perceived in the practice of it, my minde by
little and little accustom'd it self to conceive its objects more
clearly and distinctly; and having not subjected it to any particular
matter, I promised my self to apply it also as profitable to the
difficulties, of other sciences as I had to Algebra: Not that I
therefore durst at first undertake to examine all which might present
themselves, for that were contrary to the order it prescribes.But
having observ'd that all their principles were to be borrowed from
Philosophy, in which I had yet found none that were certain, I thought
it were needfull for me in the first place to endevor to establish some,
and that this being the most important thing in the world, wherein
precipitation and prevention were the most to be feared, I should not
undertake to performe it, till I had attain'd to a riper Age then XXIII.Before I had formerly employed a long time in
preparing my self thereunto, aswel in rooting out of my minde all the
ill opinions I had before that time received, as in getting a stock of
experience to serve afterwards for the subject of my reasonings, and in
exercising my self always in the Method I had prescribed.That I might
the more and more confine my self therein.But as it is not enough to pull down the house where we dwell, before we
begin to re-edify it, and to make provision of materials and architects,
or performe that office our selves; nor yet to have carefully laid the
design of it; but we must also have provided our selves of some other
place of abode during the time of the rebuilding: So that I might not
remain irresolute in my actions, while reason would oblige me to be so
in my judgments, and that I might continue to live the most happily I
could, I form'd for my own use in the interim a Moral, which consisted
but of three or four Maximes, which I shall communicate unto you.The first was to obey the lawes and customes of my Country, constantly
adhaering to that Religion wherein by the grace of God I had from mine
infancy bin bred.And in all other things behaving my self according to
the most moderate opinions and those which were farthest from excesse,
which were commonly received in practice by the most judicious Men,
amongst whom I was to live: For beginning from that very time, to reckon
mine own for nothing, because I could bring them all to the test, I was
confident I could not do better then follow those of the deepest sense;
and although perhaps there are as understanding men amongst the Persians
or Chineses as amongst us, yet I thought it was more fit to regulate my
self by those with whom I was to live, and that I might truly know what
their opinions were, I was rather to observe what they practic'd, then
what they taught.Not only by reason of the corruption of our manners,
there are but few who will say, all they beleeve, but also because
divers are themselves ignorant of it; for the act of the thought by
which we beleeve a thing, being different from that whereby we know that
we believe it, the one often is without the other.And amongst divers
opinions equally receiv'd, I made choise of the most moderate only, as
well because they are always the most fit for practice, and probably the
best, all excess being commonly ill; As also that I might less err from
the right way, if I should perhaps miss it, then if having chosen one of
the extremes, it might prove to be the other, which I should have
followed.And particularly I plac'd amongst extremities, all those
promises by which we somwhat restrain our liberty.Not that I
disapproved the laws, which to cure the inconstancy of weak minds,
permit us when we have any good design, or else for the preservation of
Commerce, one that is but indifferent, to make vows or contracts, which
oblige us to persevere in them: But because I saw nothing in the world
remain always in the same state; and forming own particular, promised my
self to perfect more and more my judgment, and not to impair it, I
should have thought my self guilty of a great fault against right
understanding, if because I then approved any thing, I were also
afterwards oblig'd to take it for good, when perhaps it ceased to be so,
or that I had ceased to esteem it so.My second Maxime was, To be the most constant and resolute in my actions
that I could; and to follow with no less perseverance the most doubtfull
opinions, when I had once determined them, then if they had been the
most certain.Imitating herein Travellers, who having lost their way in
a Forrest, ought not to wander, turning now this way, and then that, and
less to abide in one place; but stil advance straight forwards, towards
one way, and not to change on slight occasions, although perhaps at
first Chance only mov'd them to determine that choice: For by that
means, if they do not go directly whither they desire, they will at
least arrive somewhere where they will probably be better then in the
midst of a Forrest.So the actions of this life admitting often of no
delay, its a most certain Truth, That when it is not in our power to
discern the truest opinions, we are to follow the most probable: Yea,
although we finde no more probability in the one then in the other, we
yet ought to determine some way, considering them afterwards no more as
doubtful in what they relate to practice; but as most true and certain;
forasmuch as the reason was so, which made us determine it.And this was
sufficient for that time to free me from all the remorse and repentance
which useth to perplex the consciences of those weak and staggering
minds, which inconstantly suffer themselves to passe to the practice of
those things as good, which they afterwards judge evill.My third Maxime was, To endevour always rather to conquer my self then
Fortune; and to change my desires, rather then the order of the world:
and generally to accustome my self to beleeve, That there is nothing
wholly in our power but our thoughts; so that after we have done our
best, touching things which are without us, all whats wanting of success
in respect of us is absolutely impossible.And this alone seem'd
sufficient to hinder me from desiring any thing which I could not
acquire, and so to render me content.For our will naturally moving us
to desire nothing, but those things which our understanding presents in
some manner as possible, certain it is, that if we consider all the good
which is without us, as equally distant from our power, we should have
no more regret for the want of those which seem due to our births, when
without any fault of ours we shall be deprived of them, then we have in
wanting the possessions of the Kingdoms of _China_ or _Mexico_.And
making (as we say) vertue of necessity, we should no more desire to be
in health being sick, or free being in prison, then we now do, to have
bodies of as incorruptible a matter as diamonds, or wings to fly like
birds.But I confess, that a long exercise, and an often reiterated
meditation, is necessary to accustom us to look on all things with that
byass: And I beleeve, in this principally consists, the secret of those
Philosophers who formerly could snatch themselves from the Empire of
Fortune, and in spight of pains and poverty, dispute felicity with their
Gods, for imploying themselves incessantly in considering the bounds
which Nature had prescribed them, they so perfectly perswaded
themselves, That nothing was in their power but their thoughts, that,
that onely was enough to hinder them from having any affection for other
things.And they disposed so absolutely of them, that therein they had
some reason to esteem themselves more rich and powerfull, more free and
happy then any other men; who wanting this _Philosophy_, though they
were never so much favoured by Nature and Fortune, could never dispose
of all things so well as they desired.Lastly, To conclude these Morals, I thought fit to make a review of mens
severall imployments in this life, that I might endeavour to make choice
of the best, and without prejudice to other mens, I thought I could not
do better then to continue in the same wherein I was, that is, to imploy
all my life in cultivating my Reason, and advancing my self, as far as I
could in the knowledge of Truth, following the Method I had prescribed
myself.I was sensible of such extreme contentment since I began to use
this Method, that I thought none could in this life be capable of any
more sweet and innocent: and daily discovering by means thereof, some
Truths which seemed to me of importance, and commonly such as other men
were ignorant of, the satisfaction I thereby received did so possesse my
minde, as if all things else concern'd me not.Besides, that the three
preceding Maximes were grounded only on the designe I had, to continue
the instruction of my self.For God having given to every one of us a
light to discern truth from falsehood, I could not beleeve I ought to
content my self one moment with the opinions of others, unlesse I had
proposed to my self in due time to imploy my judgment in the examination
of them.Neither could I have exempted my self from scruple in following
them, had I not hoped to lose no occasion of finding out better, if
there were any.But to conclude, I could not have bounded my desires, nor have been
content, had I not followed a way, whereby thinking my self assured to
acquire all the knowledge I could be capable of: I thought I might by
the same means attain to all that was truly good, which should ever be
within my power; forasmuch as our Will inclining it self to follow, or
fly nothing but what our Understanding proposeth good or ill, to judge
well is sufficient to do well, and to judge the best we can, to do also
what's best; to wit, to acquire all vertues, and with them all
acquirable goods: and whosoever is sure of that, he can never fail of
being content.After I had thus confirmed my self with these Maximes, and laid them up
with the Articles of Faith, which always had the first place in my
Belief, I judg'd that I might freely undertake to expell all the rest of
my opinions.And forasmuch as I did hope to bring it the better to passe
by conversing with men, then by staying any longer in my stove, where I
had had all these thoughts: before the Winter was fully ended, I
returned to my travels; and in all the nine following yeers I did
nothing but rowl here and there about the world, endeavouring rather to
be a spectator, then an actor in all those Comedies which were acted
therein: and reflecting particularly on every subject which might render
it suspected, or afford any occasion mistake.In the mean time I rooted
out of my minde all those errours which formerly had crept in.Not that
I therein imitated the Scepticks, who doubt onely to the end they may
doubt, and affect to be always unresolved: For on the contrary, all my
designe tended onely to fix my self, and to avoid quick-mires and sands,
that I might finde rock and clay: which (me thought) succeeded well
enough; forasmuch as, seeking to discover the falshood or uncertainty of
those propositions I examined, (not by weak conjectures, but by clear
and certain ratiocinations) I met with none so doubtfull, but I thence
drew some conclusion certain enough, were it but onely this, That it
contained nothing that was certain.And as in pulling down an old house,
commonly those materials are reserved which may serve to build a new
one; so in destroying all those my opinions which I judg'd ill grounded,
I made divers observations, and got severall experiences which served me
since to establish more certain ones.And besides I continued to
exercise my self in the Method I had prescribed.For I was not only carefull to direct all my thoughts in generall
according to its rules, but I from time to time reserv'd some houres,
which I particularly employd to practice it in difficulties belonging to
the Mathematicks, loosening from all the principles of other Sciences,
which I found not stable enough, as you may see I have done in divers
explain'd in my other following discourses.And thus not living in
appearance otherwise then those who having no other business then to
lead a sweet and innocent life, study to separate pleasures from vices,
and use honest recreations to enjoy their ease without wearinesse; I did
not forbear to pursue my design, and advance in the knowledg of truth,
perhaps more, then if I had done nothing but read books or frequent
learned men.Yet these nine years were vanished, before I had engaged my self in
those difficulties which use to be disputed amongst the learned; or
begun to seek the grounds of any more certain Philosophy then the
Vulgar: And the example of divers excellent Men who formerly having had
the same designe, seem'd not to me to have succeeded therein, made me
imagine so much difficulty, that I had not perhaps dar'd so quickly to
have undertaken it, had I not perceiv'd that some already had given it
out that I had already accomplished it.I know not whereupon they
grounded this opinion, and if I have contributed any thing thereto by my
discourse, it must have been by confessing more ingeniously what I was
ignorant of, then those are wont to do who have a little studyed, and
perhaps also by comunicating those reasons, I had to doubt of many
things which others esteem'd most eminent, rather then that I bragg'd of
any learning.But having integrity enough, not to desire to be taken for
what I was not, I thought that I ought to endeavour by all means to
render my self worthy of the reputation which was given me.And 'tis now
eight years since this desire made me resolve to estrange my self from
all places where I might have any acquaintance, and so retire my self
hither in a Country where the long continuance of the warre hath
established such orders, that the Armies which are intertain'd there,
seem to serve onely to make the inhabitants enjoy the fruits of peace
with so much the more security; and where amongst the croud of a great
people more active and solicitous for their own affaires, then curious
of other mens, not wanting any of those necessaries which are in the
most frequented Towns, I could live as solitary and retired as in the
most remote deserts.I Know not whether I ought to entertain you with the first Meditations
which I had there, for they are so Metaphysicall and so little common,
that perhaps they will not be relished by all men: And yet that you may
judge whether the foundations I have laid are firm enough, I find my
self in a manner oblig'd to discourse them; I had long since observed
that as for manners, it was somtimes necessary to follow those opinions
which we know to be very uncertain, as much as if they were indubitable,
as is beforesaid: But because that then I desired onely to intend the
search of truth, I thought I ought to doe the contrary, and reject as
absolutely false all wherein I could imagine the least doubt, to the end
I might see if afterwards any thing might remain in my belief, not at
all subject to doubt.Thus because our senses sometimes deceive us, I
would suppose that there was nothing which was such as they represented
it to us.And because there are men who mistake themselves in reasoning,
even in the most simple matters of Geometry, and make therein
Paralogismes, judging that I was as subject to fail as any other Man, I
rejected as false all those reasons, which I had before taken for
Demonstrations.And considering, that the same thoughts which we have
waking, may also happen to us sleeping, when as not any one of them is
true.I resolv'd to faign, that all those things which ever entred into
my Minde, were no more true, then the illusions of my dreams.But
presently after I observ'd, that whilst I would think that all was
false, it must necessarily follow, that I who thought it, must be
something.And perceiving that this Truth, _I think_, therefore, _I am_,
was so firm and certain, that all the most extravagant suppositions of
the Scepticks was not able to shake it, I judg'd that I might receive it
without scruple for the first principle of the Philosophy I sought.Examining carefully afterwards what I was; and seeing that I could
suppose that I had no _body_, and that there was no _World_, nor any
_place_ where I was: but for all this, I could not feign that I _was
not_; and that even contrary thereto, thinking to doubt the truth of
other things, it most evidently and certainly followed, That _I was_:
whereas, if I had ceas'd to _think_, although all the rest of what-ever
I had imagined were true, I had no reason to beleeve that _I had been_.I knew then that I was a substance, whose whole essence or nature is,
but to _think_, and who to _be_, hath need of no place, nor depends on
any materiall thing.So that this _Me_, to wit, my Soul, by which I am
what I am, is wholly distinct from the Body, and more easie to be known
then _it_; and although _that_ were not, it would not therefore cease to
be what it is.After this I considered in generall what is requisite in a Proposition
to make it true and certain: for since I had found out one which I knew
to be so, I thought I ought also to consider wherein that certainty
consisted: and having observed, That there is nothing at all in this, _I
think_, therefore _I am_, which assures me that I speak the truth,
except this, that I see most cleerly, That _to think_, one must have a
_being_; I judg'd that I might take for a generall rule, That those
things which we conceive cleerly and distinctly, are all true; and that
the onely difficulty is punctually to observe what those are which we
distinctly conceive.In pursuance whereof, reflecting on what I doubted, and that
consequently my _being_ was not perfect; for I clearly perceived, that
it was a greater perfection to know, then to doubt, I advised in my
self to seek from whence I had learnt to think on something which was
more perfect then I; and I knew evidently that it must be of some nature
which was indeed more perfect.As for what concerns the thoughts I had
of divers other things without my self, as of heaven, earth, light,
heat, and a thousand more, I was not so much troubled to know whence
they came, for that I observed nothing in them which seemed to render
them superiour to me; I might beleeve, that if they were true, they were
dependancies from my nature, as far forth as it had any perfection; and
if they were not, I made no accompt of them; that is to say, That they
were in me, because I had something deficient.But it could not be the
same with the _Idea_ of a being more perfect then mine: For to esteem of
it as of nothing, was a thing manifestly impossible.And because there
is no lesse repugnancy that the more perfect should succeed from and
depend upon the less perfect, then for something to proceed from
nothing, I could no more hold it from my self: So as it followed, that
it must have bin put into me by a Nature which was truly more perfect
then _I_, and even which had in it all the perfections whereof I could
have an _Idea_; to wit, (to explain my self in one word) God.Whereto I
added, that since I knew some perfections which I had not, I was not the
onely _Being_ which had an existence, (I shall, under favour, use here
freely the terms of the Schools) but that of necessity there must be
some other more perfect whereon I depended, and from whom I had gotten
all what I had: For had I been alone, and depending upon no other thing,
so that I had had of my self all that little which I participated of a
perfect Being, I might have had by the same reason from my self, all the
remainder which I knew I wanted, and so have been my self infinite,
eternall, immutable, all-knowing, almighty; and lastly, have had all
those perfections which I have observed to be in God.For according to
the way of reasoning I have now followed, to know the nature of God, as
far as mine own was capable of it, I was onely to consider of those
things of which I found an _Idea_ in me, whether the possessing of them
were a perfection or no; and I was sure, that any of those which had any
imperfections were not in him, but that all others were.I saw that
doubtfulness, inconstancy, sorrow and the like, could not be in him,
seeing I could my self have wish'd to have been exempted from them.Besides this, I had the _Ideas_ of divers sensible and corporeall
things; for although I supposed that I doted, and that all that I saw or
imagined was false; yet could I not deny but that these _Ideas_ were
truly in my thoughts.But because I had most evidently known in my self,
That the understanding Nature is distinct from the corporeall,
considering that all composition witnesseth a dependency, and that
dependency is manifestly a defect, I thence judged that it could not be
a perfection in God to be composed of those two Natures; and that by
consequence he was not so composed.But that if there were any Bodies in
the world, or els any intelligences, or other Natures which were not
wholly perfect, their being must depend from his power in such a manner,
that they could not subsist one moment without him.Thence I went in search of other Truths; and having proposed _Geometry_
for my object, which I conceived as a continued Body, or a space
indefinitely spred in length, bredth, height or depth, divisible into
divers parts, which might take severall figures and bignesses, and be
moved and transposed every way.For the Geometricians suppose all this
in their object.I past through some of their most simple
demonstrations; and having observed that this great certaintie, which
all the world grants them, is founded only on this, that men evidently
conceived them, following the rule I already mentioned.I observed also
that there was nothing at all in them which ascertain'd me of the
existence of their object.As for example, I well perceive, that
supposing a Triangle, three angles necessarily must be equall to two
right ones: but yet nevertheless I saw nothing which assured me that
there was a Triangle in the world.Whereas returning to examine the
_Idea_ which I had of a perfect Being, _I_ found its existence comprised
in it, in the same manner as it was comprised in that of a Triangle,
where the three angles are equall to two right ones; or in that of a
sphere, where all the parts are equally distant from the center.Or even
yet more evidently, and that by consequence, it is at least as certain
that God, who is that perfect Being, is, or exists, as any demonstration
in Geometry can be.But that which makes many perswade themselves that there is difficulty
in knowing it, as also to know what their Soul is, 'tis that they never
raise their thoughts beyond sensible things, and that they are so
accustomed to consider nothing but by imagination, which is a particular
manner of thinking on materiall things, that whatsoever is not
imaginable seems to them not intelligible.Which is manifest enough from
this, that even the Philosophers hold for a Maxime in the Schools, That
there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense;
where notwithstanding its certain, that the _Ideas_ of God and of the
Soul never were.And (me thinks) those who use their imagination to
comprehend them, are just as those, who to hear sounds, or smell odours,
would make use of their eys; save that there is yet this difference,
That the sense of seeing assures us no lesse of the truth of its
objects, then those of smelling or hearing do: whereas neither our
imagination, nor our senses, can ever assure us of any thing, if our
understanding intervenes not.To be short, if there remain any who are not enough perswaded of the
existence of God, and of their soul, from the reasons I have produc'd, I
would have them know, that all other things, whereof perhaps they think
themselves more assured, as to have a body, and that there are Stars,
and an earth, and the like, are less certain.For although we had such a
morall assurance of these things, that without being extravagant we
could not doubt of them.However, unless we be unreasonable when a
metaphysicall certainty is in question, we cannot deny but we have cause
enough not to be wholly confirmed in them, when we consider that in the
same manner we may imagine being asleep, we have other bodies, and that
we see other Stars, and another earth, though there be no such thing.For how doe we know that those thoughts which we have in our dreams,
are rather false then the others, seeing often they are no less lively
and significant, and let the ablest men study it as long as they please,
I beleeve they can give no sufficient reason to remove this doubt,
unless they presuppose the existence of God.For first of all, that
which I even now took for a rule, to wit, that those things which were
most clearly and distinctly conceived, are all true, is certain, only by
reason, that God is or exists, and that he is a perfect being, and that
all which we have comes from him.Whence it follows, that our Idea's or
notions, being reall things, and which come from God in all wherein they
are clear and distinct, cannot therein be but true.So that if we have
very often any which contain falshood, they cannot be but of such things
which are somewhat confus'd and obscure, because that therein they
signifie nothing to us, that's to say, that they are thus confus'd in us
only, because we are not wholly perfect.And it's evident that there is
no less contrariety that falshood and imperfection should proceed from
God, as such, then there is in this, that truth and falshood proceed
from nothing.But if we know not that whatsoever was true and reall in
us comes from a perfect and infinite being, how clear and distinct
soever our Idea's were, we should have no reason to assure us, that they
had the perfection to be true.Now after that the knowledge of God, and of the Soul hath rendred us
thus certain of this rule, it's easie to know; that the extravaganceys
which we imagin in our sleep, ought no way to make us doubt of the truth
of those thoughts which we have being awake: For if it should happen,
that even sleeping we should have a very distinct Idea; as for example,
A Geometritian should invent some new demonstration, his sleeping would
not hinder it to be true.And for the most ordinary error of our
dreames, which consists in that they represent unto us severall objects
in the same manner as our exterior senses doe, it matters not though it
give us occasion to mistrust the truth of those Ideas, because that they
may also often enough cozen us when we doe not sleep; As when to those
who have the Jaundies, all they see seems yellow; or, as the Stars or
other bodies at a distance, appear much less then they are.For in fine,
whether we sleep or wake, we ought never to suffer our selves to be
perswaded but by the evidence of our Reason; I say, (which is
observable) Of our Reason, and not of our imagination, or of our senses.As although we see the Sun most clearly, we are not therefore to judge
him to be of the bigness we see him of; and we may well distinctly
imagine the head of a Lion, set on the body of a Goat, but therefore we
ought not to conclude that there is a _Chimera_ in the world.For reason
doth not dictate to us, that what we see or imagine so, is true: But it
dictates, that all our Idea's or notions ought to have some grounds of
truth; For it were not possible, that God who is all perfect, and all
truth, should have put them in us without that: And because that our
reasonings are never so evident, nor so entire while we sleep, as when
we wake, although sometimes our imaginations be then as much or more
lively and express.It also dictates to us, that our thoughts, seeing
they cannot be all true by reason that we are not wholly perfect; what
they have of truth, ought infallibly to occur in those which we have
being awake, rather then in our dreams.V.


I should be glad to pursue this Discourse, and shew you the whole Series
of the following Truths, which I have drawn from the former: But because
for this purpose, it were now necessary for me to treat of severall
questions, which are controverted by the learned, with whom I have no
desire to imbroil my self, I beleeve it better for me to abstain from
it; and so in generall onely to discover what they are, that I may leave
the wisest to judge whether it were profitable to inform the publick
more particularly of them.I alwayes remained constant to my resolution,
to suppose no other Principle but that which I now made use of, for the
demonstration of the Existence of God, and of the Soul; and to receive
nothing for true, which did not seem to me more clear and more certain
then the demonstrations of Geometry had formerly done.And yet I dare
say, that I have not onely found out the means to satisfie my self, in a
short time, concerning all the principall difficulties which are usually
treated in Philosophy.But that also _I_ have observed certain Laws
which God hath so established in Nature, and of which he hath imprinted
such notions in our Souls, that when we shall have made sufficient
reflections upon them we cannot doubt but that they are exactly observed
in whatsoever either is, or is done in the World.Then considering the
connexion of these Laws, me thinks, I have discovercd divers Truths,
more usefull and important then whatever _I_ learn'd before, or ever
hop'd to learn.But because _I_ have endeavoured to lay open the principall of them in a
Treatise, which some considerations hinder me from publishing; _I_ can
no way better make them known, then by relating summarily what it
contains.I had a designe to comprehend all what I thought _I_ knew, before _I_
would write it, touching the nature of material things.But even as
Painters, not being able equally well to represent upon a _flat_ all the
severall facies of a solid body, chuse the principall of them, which
they place towards the light; and shadowing the others, make them appear
no more then they do to our sight: So, fearing lest _I_ should not bring
into this Discourse all which was in my thoughts, _I_ onely undertook to
set forth at large my conceptions touching the light; and upon that
occasion to add somewhat of the Sun, and of the fix'd Stars, by reason
that it proceeds almost all from thence; of the Heavens, because they
transmit it; of the Planets, of the Comets, and of the Earth, because
they cause it to reflect; and in particular, of all Bodies which are on
the earth, whether for that they are either coloured, or transparent, or
luminous; and last of all, of Man, because he is the Spectator thereof.As also, in some manner to shadow out all these things, and that _I_
might the more freely speak what _I_ judg'd, without being obliged to
follow, or to refute the opinions which are received amongst the
Learned, _I_ resolved to leave all this world here to their disputes,
and to speak onely of what would happen in a new one, if God now created
some where in those imaginary spaces matter enough to compose it, and
that he diversly and without order agitated the severall parts of this
matter, so as to compose a Chaos of it as confused as the Poets could
feign one: and that afterwards he did nothing but lend his ordinary
concurrence to Nature, and leave her to work according to the Laws he
hath established.Thus first of all _I_ described this Matter, and endevoured to
represent it such, that me thinks there is nothing in the world more
clear, or more intelligible, except what was beforesaid of God, and of
the Soul.For even _I_ expresly supposed that there was in it none of
those forms and qualities which are disputed in the Schools; nor
generally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to
our understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without
grounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite
perfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might
be questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had
created divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not
observed.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of
this _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it
self in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how
some of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and
Commets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.And here enlarging my self
on the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,
which was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an
instant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self
from Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things
touching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several
qualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had
said enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of
this world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether
like to these of that world which _I_ described.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had
expresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof
it was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:
How that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition
of the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to
cause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that
which we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the
water, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the
Tropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might
naturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants
grow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which
are call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in
the world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly
understood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,
how sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely
light without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several
bodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens
others; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and
smoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its
action, it forms glass.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,
seeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I
particularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was
created after the manner I had proposed.For it is more probable that
God made it such as it was to be, from the beginning.But it's certain,
and 'tis an opinion commonly received amongst the Divines, That the
action whereby he now preserveth it, is the same with that by which he
created it.So that, although at the beginning he had given it no other
form but that of a Chaos (provided, that having established the Laws of
Nature, he had afforded his concurrence to it, to work as it used to do)
we may beleeve (without doing wrong to the miracle of the Creation) that
by that alone all things which are purely material might in time have
rendred themselves such as we now see them: and their nature is far
easier to conceive, when by little and little we see them brought forth
so, then when we consider them quite form'd all at once.From the description of inanimate Bodies and Plants, I pass'd to that of
Animals, and particularly to that of Men.But because I had not yet
knowledge enough to speak of them in the same stile as of the others; to
wit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what
seeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my
self to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one
of ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour
conformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of
that which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning
any reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a
vegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of
those fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I
conceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed
before it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon
the grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in
this body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our
thinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct
part from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely
to think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same
wherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.Yet could I not
finde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones
which belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having
supposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to
this body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present
you with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the
arteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in
animals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the
rest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I
shall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would
take the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great
animal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very
like that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or
concavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two
large conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal
receptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other
veins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so
mis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its
_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into
divers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner
two pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,
the veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing
else but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into
several branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those
of that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its
branches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully
observe the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open
and shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,
three at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that
they can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into
the right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from
coming out.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being
disposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that
concavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to
return thither.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,
which permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but
opposeth its return.And three at the entry of the great artery, which
permit it to go from the heart, but hinder its return thither.Neither
need we seek any other reason for the number of these skins, save only
that the opening of the veinous artery, being oval-wise, by reason of
its situation, may be fitly shut with two; whereas the other, being
round, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them
consider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a
composition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,
and make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which
are composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in
the heart then in any other part of the body.And in fine, that if any
drop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it
presently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when
drop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the
heart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,
necessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and
from the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are
always full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart
cannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of
bloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which
cannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter
are very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are
rarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By
means whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the
five little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they
come, hindering thereby any more bloud to fall down into the heart, and
continuing more and more to rarifie themselves, they drive and open the
six other little doors which are at the entry of the other two vessels
whence they issue, causing by that means all the branches of the
arterious vein, and of the great artery, to swel (as it were) at the
same time with the heart: which presently after fals, as those arteries
also do, by reason that the bloud which is entred therein grows colder,
and their six little doors shut up again, and those five of the _vena
cava_, and of the veinous artery open again, and give way to two other
drops of bloud, which again swell the heart and the arteries in the same
manner as the preceding did.And because the bloud which thus enters
into the heart, passeth thorow those two purses, which are call'd the
ears; thence it comes, that their motion is contrary to the heart's, and
that they fall when that swels.Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,
and are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,
may not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise
them, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily
follows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be
seen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our
fingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by
experience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and
figure of its weight and wheels.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not
exhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the
arteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart
dischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what
hath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must
be given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who
taught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of
the arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,
enters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self
back towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a
perpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary
experience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard
above the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to
issue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary
would happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the
incision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band
indifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in
the arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore
hinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they
are placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less
easie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,
seeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to
return from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud
which issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must
necessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the
extremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he
also proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through
certain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the
veins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the
extremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the
body may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,
although it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and
the ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud
which issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of
this motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The
difference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that
which comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being
rarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its
more subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;
that is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it
enters them, that is to say, in the veins.And if you observe, you will
finde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and
not so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse
of the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,
sheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly
then against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,
and the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,
and the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous
artery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the
heart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the
bloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.And what can the
Physicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that
according as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the
heart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick
then before.And if we examine how this heat is communicated to the
other members, must we not avow that 'tis by means of the bloud, which
passing the heart, reheats it self there, and thence disperseth it self
thorow the whole body: whence it happens, that if you take away the
bloud from any part, the heat by the same means also is taken a way.And
although the heart were as burning as hot iron, it were not sufficient
to warm the feet and the hands so often as it doth, did it not continue
to furnish them with new bloud.Besides, from thence we know also that the true use of respiration is to
bring fresh air enough to the lungs, to cause that bloud which comes
from the right concavity of the heart, where it was rarified, and (as it
were) chang'd into vapours, there to thicken, and convert it self into
bloud again, before it fall again into the left, without which it would
not be fit to serve for the nourishment of the fire which is there.Which is confirm'd, for that its seen, that animals which have no lungs
have but one onely concavity in the heart; and that children, who can
make no use of them when they are in their mothers bellies, have an
opening, by which the bloud of the _vena cava_ runs to the left
concavity of the heart, and a conduit by which it comes from the
arterious vein into the great artery without passing the lungs.Next, How would the concoction be made in the stomach, unlesse the heart
sent heat by the arteries, and therewithall some of the most fluid parts
of the bloud, which help to dissolve the meat receiv'd therein?and is
not the act which converts the juice of these meats into bloud easie to
be known, if we consider, that it is distill'd by passing and repassing
the heart, perhaps more then one or two hundred times a day?And what
need we ought else to explain the nutrition and the production of divers
humours which are in the body, but to say, that the force wherewith the
bloud in rarifying it self, passeth from the heart towards the
extremities or the arteries, causeth some of its parts to stay amongst
those of the members where they are, and there take the place of some
others, which they drive from thence?And that according to the
situation, or the figure, or the smalnesse of the pores which they
meet, some arrive sooner in one place then others.In the same manner
as we may have seen in severall sieves, which being diversly pierc'd,
serve to sever divers grains one from the other.And briefly, that which
is most remarkable herein, is the generation of the animal spirits,
which are as a most subtil wind, or rather, as a most pure and lively
flame, which continually rising in great abundance from the heart to the
brain, dischargeth it self thence by the nerves into the muscles, and
gives motion to all the members; without imagining any other reason
which might cause these parts of the bloud, which being most mov'd, and
the most penetrating, are the most fit to form these spirits, tend
rather towards the brain, then to any other part.Save onely that the
arteries which carry them thither, are those which come from the heart
in the most direct line of all: And that according to the rules of the
Mechanicks, which are the same with those of Nature, when divers things
together strive to move one way, where there is not room enough for all;
so those parts of bloud which issue from the left concavity of the heart
tend towards the brain, the weaker and less agitated are expell'd by the
stronger, who by that means arrive there alone.I had particularly enough expounded all these things in a Treatise which
I formerly had design'd to publish: In pursuit whereof, I had therein
shewed what ought to be the fabrick of the nerves and muscles of an
humane body, to cause those animall spirits which were in them, to have
the power to move those members.As we see that heads a while after they
are cut off, yet move of themselves, and bite the ground, although they
are not then animated.What changes ought to be made in the brain to
cause waking, sleeping, and dreaming: how light, sounds, smels, tasts,
heat, and all other qualities of exteriour objects, might imprint
severall _Ideas_ by means of the senses.How hunger and thirst, and the
other interiour passions might also send theirs thither.What ought to
be taken therein for common sense, where these _Ideas_ are received; for
memory which preserves them; and for fancy, which can diversly change
them, and form new ones of them; and by the same means, distributing the
animal spirits into the muscles, make the members of the body move in so
many severall fashions, and as fitly to those objects which present
themselves to its senses; and to the interiour passions which are in
them, as ours may move themselves without the consent of the Wil.Which
wil seem nothing strange to those, who knowing how many _Automatas_ or
moving Machines the industry of men can make, imploying but very few
pieces, in comparison of the great abundance of bones, muscles, nerves,
arteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every
Animal, will consider this body as a fabrick, which having been made by
the hands of God, is incomparably better ordered, and hath more
admirable motions in it then any of those which can be invented by men.And herein I particularly insisted, to make it appear, that if there
were such Machines which had organs, and the exteriour figure of an Ape,
or of any other unreasonable creature, we should finde no means of
knowing them not to be altogether of the same nature as those Animals:
whereas, if there were any which resembled our bodies, and imitated our
actions as much as morally it were possible, we should always have two
most certain ways to know, that for all that they were not reall men:
The first of which is, that they could never have the use of speech, nor
of other signes in framing it, as we have, to declare our thoughts to
others: for we may well conceive, that a Machine may be so made, that it
may utter words, and even some proper to the corporal actions, which
may cause some change in its organs; as if we touch it in some part, and
it should ask what we would say; or so as it might cry out that one
hurts it, and the like: but not that they can diversifie them to answer
sensibly to all what shall be spoken in its presence, as the dullest men
may do.And the second is, That although they did divers things aswel,
or perhaps better, then any of us, they must infallibly fail in some
others, whereby we might discover that they act not with knowledge, but
onely by the disposition of their organs: for whereas Reason is an
universal instrument which may serve in all kinde of encounters, these
organs have need of some particular disposition for every particular
action: whence it is, that its morally impossible for one Machine to
have severall organs enough to make it move in all the occurrences of
this life, in the same manner as our Reason makes us move.Now by these
two means we may also know the difference which is between Men and
Beasts: For 'tis a very remarkable thing, that there are no men so dull
and so stupid, without excepting those who are out of their wits, but
are capable to rank severall words together, and of them to compose a
Discourse, by which they make known their thoughts: and that on the
contrary, there is no other creature, how perfect or happily soever
brought forth, which can do the like.The which happens, not because
they want organs; for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words
even as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with
evidence that they think what they say.Whereas Men, being born deaf and
dumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as
much or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood
by those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their
expressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse
reason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs
not much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality
amongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some
are more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that
an Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should
therein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a
distracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different
from ours.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,
which witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by
Animals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although
we do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they
have divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make
themselves understood by us, as by their like.Its likewise very
remarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more
industry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,
that the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do
better then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that
reckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in
all other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its
Nature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their
organs.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and
springs, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then
we can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that
it could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things
whereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:
And how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a
Pilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its
necessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have
thoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by
reason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny
God, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none
which sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then
to imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and
that consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no
more then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,
we comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a
nature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not
subject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which
destroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these
things, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the
Presse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose
authority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my
thoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little
before by another; of which I will not say that I was, but that indeed I
had observed nothing therein, before their censure, which I could have
imagined prejudiciall either to Religion or the State; or consequently,
which might have hindred me from writing the same, had my Reason
perswaded mee thereto.And this made me fear, lest in the same manner
there might be found some one amongst mine, in which I might have been
mistaken; notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new
ones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and
not to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which
was sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were
very strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of
Book-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from
it.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not
only somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to
know them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own
brain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I
use, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which
belong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my
Manners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to
write any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one
abounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as
heads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath
established as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath
dispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change
of any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please
me, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd
them more.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching
naturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular
difficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far
different they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I
judg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against
the Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the
general good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was
possible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable
for this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is
taught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which
knowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of
the Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we
know the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner
employ them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and
possessours of Nature.Which is not onely to be desired for the
invention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might
make us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which
are to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of
health, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of
all other good things in this life.For even the minde depends so much
on the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be
possible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more
able then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in
Physick.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,
whose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting
of it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,
but will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in
companion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from
very many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also
perhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of
their Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished
us.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so
necessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me
thinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the
shortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was
no better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to
communicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to
invite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing
every one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments
which are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the
things they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the
precedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we
might all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the
more necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.For in the
beginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are
presented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do
but make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest
and most studied ones.The reason whereof is, that those which are
rarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most
common ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it
were, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to
finde them out.First, I
endevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of
whatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for
this end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then
from certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After
this, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which
might be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found
out Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and
Fire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most
common, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to
be understood.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more
particular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,
that I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to
distinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from
an infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will
of God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,
unless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers
particular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all
those objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,
I observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the
principles I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of
Nature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and
generall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I
presently know it might be deduced from thence in many severall ways:
and that commonly my greatest difficulty is to finde in which of these
ways it depends thereon; for I know no other expedient for that, but
again to seek some experiments, which may be such, that their event may
not be the same, if it be in one of those ways which is to be exprest,
as if it were in another.In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)
I see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of
those experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they
are such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate
(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for
all.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make
more or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the
knowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise
which I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the
Publick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general
who desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are
indeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to
communicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in
the enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and
think that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which
I judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of
them, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I
might have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as
without doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the
publick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and
oftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first
conceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing
them to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the
Publick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,
those to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what
use of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published
during my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto
perhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it
were, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of
mispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for
although it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in
him lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is
properly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought
to reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those
things which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are
alive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more
advantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that
the little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of
what I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For
it's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the
truth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less
troubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were
poorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of
Armies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;
and who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss
of a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which
hinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight
battails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or
weighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity
required to recover our former condition, then to make great progresses
where our Principles are already certain.For my part, if I formerly
have discovered some Truths in Learning, as I hope my Discourse will
make it appear I have, I may say, they are but the products and
dependances of five or six principall difficulties which I have
overcome, and which I reckon for so many won Battails on my side.Neither will I forbear to say; That I think, It's only necessary for me
to win two or three more such, wholly to perfect my design.And that I
am not so old, but according to the ordinary course of Nature, I may
have time enough to effect it.But I beleeve I am so much the more
obliged to husband the rest of my time, as I have more hopes to employ
it well; without doubt, I should have divers occasions of impeding it,
should I publish the grounds of my Physicks.For although they are
almost all so evident, that to beleeve them, it's needfull onely to
understand them; and that there is none whereof I think my self unable
to give demonstration.Yet because it's impossible that they should
agree with all the severall opinions of other men, I foresee I should
often be diverted by the opposition they would occasion.It may be objected, These oppositions might be profitable, as well to
make me know my faults, as if any thing of mine were good to make others
by that means come to a better understanding thereof; and as many may
see more then one man, beginning from this time to make use of my
grounds, they might also help me with their invention.But although I
know my self extremely subject to fail, and do never almost trust my
first thoughts; yet the experience I have of the objections which may be
made unto me, hinder me from hoping for any profit from them; For I have
often tried the judgments as well of those whom I esteem'd my friends,
as of others whom I thought indifferent, and even also of some, whose
malignity and envie did sufficiently discover what the affection of my
friends might hide.But it seldom happened that any thing was objected
against me, which I had not altogether foreseen, unless it were very
remote from my Subject: So that I never almost met with any Censurer of
my opinions, that seemed unto me either less rigorous, or less equitable
then my self.Neither did I ever observe, that by the disputations
practiced in the Schools any Truth which was formerly unknown, was ever
discovered.For whilest every one seeks to overcome, men strive more to
maintain probabilities, then to weigh the reasons on both sides; and
those who for a long time have been good Advocates, are not therefore
the better Judges afterwards.As for the benefit which others may receive from the communication of my
thoughts, it cannot also be very great, forasmuch as I have not yet
perfected them, but that it is necessary to add many things thereunto,
before a usefull application can be made of them.And I think I may say
without vanity, That if there be any one capable thereof, it must be my
self, rather then any other.Not but that there may be divers wits in
the world incomparably better then mine; but because men cannot so well
conceive a thing and make it their own, when they learn it of another,
as when they invent it themselves: which is so true in this Subject,
that although I have often explain'd some of my opinions to very
understanding men, and who, whilest I spake to them, seem'd very
distinctly to conceive them; yet when they repeated them, I observ'd,
that they chang'd them almost always in such a manner, that I could no
longer own them for mine.Upon which occasion, I shall gladly here
desire those who come after me, never to beleeve those things which may
be delivered to them for mine, when I have not published them my self.And I do not at all wonder at the extravagancies which are attributed to
all those ancient Philosophers, whose Writings we have not; neither do I
thereby judge, that their thoughts were very irrationall, seeing they
were the best Wits of their time; but onely that they have been ill
convey'd to us: as it appears also, that never any of their followers
surpass'd them.And I assure my self, that the most passionate of those,
who now follow _Aristotle_, would beleeve himself happy, had he but as
much knowledge of Nature as he had, although it were on condition that
he never might have more: They are like the ivie, which seeks to climb
no higher then the trees which support it, and ever after tends
downwards again when it hath attain'd to the height thereof: for, me
thinks also, that such men sink downwards; that is to say, render
themselves in some manner lesse knowing, then if they did abstain from
studying; who being not content to know all which is intelligibly set
down in their Authour, will besides that, finde out the solution of
divers difficulties of which he says nothing, and perhaps never thought
of them: yet their way of Philosophy is very fit for those who have but
mean capacities: For the obscurity of the distinctions and principles
which they use causeth them to speak of all things as boldly, as if they
knew them, and maintain all which they say, against the most subtill and
most able; so that there is no means left to convince them.Wherein they
seem like to a blinde man, who, to fight without disadvantage against
one that sees, should challenge him down into the bottom of a very dark
cellar: And I may say, that it is these mens interest, that I should
abstain from publishing the principles of the Philosophy I use, for
being most simple and most evident, as they are, I should even do the
same in publishing of them, as if I opened some windows, to let the day
into this cellar, into which they go down to fight.But even the best
Wits have no reason to wish for the knowledge of them: for if they will
be able to speak of all things, and acquire the reputation of being
learned, they will easily attain to it by contenting themselves with
probability, which without much trouble may be found in all kinde of
matters; then in seeking the Truth, which discovers it self but by
little and little, in some few things; and which, when we are to speak
of others, oblige us freely to confesse our ignorance of them.But if
they prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of seeming to
be ignorant of nothing, as without doubt they ought to do, and will
undertake a designe like mine, I need not tell them any more for this
purpose, but what I have already said in this Discourse: For if they
have a capacity to advance farther then I have done, they may with
greater consequence finde out of themselves whatsoever I think I have
found; Forasmuch as having never examined any thing but by order, it's
certain, that what remains yet for me to discover, is in it self more
difficult and more hid, then what I have already here before met with;
and they would receive much less satisfaction in learning it from me,
then from themselves.Besides that, the habit which they would get by
seeking first of all the easie things, and passing by degrees to others
more difficult, will be more usefull to them, then all my instructions.As I for my part am perswaded, that had I been taught from my youth all
the Truths whose demonstrations I have discovered since, and had taken
no pains to learn them, perhaps I should never have known any other, or
at least, I should never have acquired that habit, and that faculty
which I think I have, still to finde out new ones, as I apply my self to
the search of them.And in a word, if there be in the world any work
which cannot be so well ended by any other, as by the same who began it,
it's that which I am now about.It's true, That one man will not be sufficient to make all the
experiments which may conduce thereunto: But withall, he cannot
profitably imploy other hands then his own, unlesse it be those of
Artists, or others whom he hires, and whom the hope of profit (which is
a very powerfull motive) might cause exactly to do all those things he
should appoint them: For as for voluntary persons, who by curiosity or a
desire to learn, would perhaps offer themselves to his help, besides
that commonly they promise more then they perform, and make onely fair
propositions, whereof none ever succeeds, they would infallibly be paid
by the solution of some difficulties, or at least by complements and
unprofitable entertainments, which could not cost him so little of his
time, but he would be a loser thereby.And for the Experiments which
others have already made, although they would even communicate them to
him (which those who call them Secrets would never do,) they are for
the most part composed of so many circumstances, or superfluous
ingredients, that it would be very hard for him to decypher the truth of
them: Besides, he would find them all so ill exprest, or else so false,
by reason that those who made them have laboured to make them appear
conformable to their principles; that if there were any which served
their turn, they could not at least be worth the while which must be
imployed in the choice of them.So that, if there were any in the world
that were certainly known to be capable of finding out the greatest
things, and the most profitable for the Publick which could be, and that
other men would therefore labour alwayes to assist him to accomplish his
Designes; I do not conceive that they could do more for him, then
furnish the expence of the experiments whereof he stood in need; and
besides, take care only that he may not be by any body hindred of his
time.But besides that, I do not presume so much of my Self, as to
promise any thing extraordinary, neither do I feed my self with such
vain hopes, as to imagine that the Publick should much interesse it self
in my designes; I have not so base a minde, as to accept of any favour
whatsoever, which might be thought I had not deserved.All these considerations joyned together, were the cause three years
since why I would not divulge the Treatise I had in hand; and which is
more, that I resolved to publish none whilest I lived, which might be so
general, as that the Grounds of my Philosophy might be understood
thereby.But since, there hath been two other reasons have obliged me to
put forth some particular Essays, and to give the Publick some account
of my Actions and Designes.The first was, that if I failed therein,
divers who knew the intention I formerly had to print some of my
Writings, might imagine that the causes for which I forbore it, might
be more to my disadvantage then they are.For although I do not affect
glory in excess; or even, (if I may so speak) that I hate it, as far as
I judge it contrary to my rest, which I esteem above all things: Yet
also did I never seek to hide my actions as crimes, neither have I been
very wary to keep my self unknown; as well because I thought I might
wrong my self, as that it might in some manner disquiet me, which would
again have been contrary to the perfect repose of my minde which I seek.And because having alwayes kept my self indifferent, caring not whether
I were known or no, I could not chuse but get some kinde of reputation,
I thought that I ought to do my best to hinder it at least from being
ill.The other reason which obliged me to write this, is, that observing
every day more and more the designe I have to instruct my self, retarded
by reason of an infinite number of experiments which are needful to me,
and which its impossible for me to make without the help of others;
although I do not so much flatter my self, as to hope that the Publick,
shares much in my concernments; yet will I not also be so much wanting
to my self, as to give any cause to those who shall survive me, to
reproach this, one day to me, That I could have left them divers things
far beyond what I have done, had I not too much neglected to make them
understand wherein they might contribute to my designe.And I thought it easie for me to choose some matters, which being not
subject to many Controversies, nor obliging me to declare any more of my
Principles then I would willingly, would neverthelesse expresse clearly
enough, what my abilities or defects are in the Sciences.Wherein I
cannot say whether I have succeeded or no; neither will I prevent the
judgment of any man by speaking of my own Writings: but I should be
glad they might be examin'd; and to that end I beseech all those who
have any objections to make, to take the pains to send them to my
Stationer, that I being advertised by him, may endeavour at the same
time to adjoyn my Answer thereunto: and by that means, the Reader seeing
both the one and the other, may the more easily judge of the Truth.For
I promise, that I will never make any long Answers, but only very freely
confesse my own faults, if I find them; or if I cannot discover them,
plainly say what I shal think requisite in defence of what I have writ,
without adding the explanation of any new matter, that I may not
endlesly engage my self out of one into another.Now if there be any whereof I have spoken in the beginning, of the
Opticks and of the Meteors, which at first jarr, by reason that I call
them Suppositions, and that I seem not willing to prove them; let a man
have but the patience to read the whole attentively, and I hope he will
rest satisfied: For (me thinks) the reasons follow each other so
closely, that as the later are demonstrated by the former, which are
their Causes; the former are reciprocally proved by the later, which are
their Effects.And no man can imagine that I herein commit the fault
which the Logicians call a _Circle_; for experience rendring the
greatest part of these effects most certain, the causes whence I deduce
them serve not so much to prove, as to explain them; but on the
contrary, they are those which are proved by them.Neither named I them
Suppositions, that it might be known that I conceive my self able to
deduce them from those first Truths which I have before discovered: But
that I would not expresly do it to crosse certain spirits, who imagine
that they know in a day al what another may have thought in twenty
yeers, as soon as he hath told them but two or three words; and who are
so much the more subject to erre, and less capable of the Truth, (as
they are more quick and penetrating) from taking occasion of erecting
some extravagant Philosophy on what they may beleeve to be my
Principles, and lest the fault should be attributed to me.For as for
those opinions which are wholly mine, I excuse them not as being new,
because that if the reasons of them be seriously considered, I assure my
self, they will be found so plain, and so agreeable to common sense,
that they will seem less extraordinary and strange then any other which
may be held on the same Subjects.Neither do I boast that I am the first
Inventor of any of them; but of this indeed, that I never admitted any
of them, neither because they had, or had not been said by others, but
only because Reason perswaded me to them.If Mechanicks cannot so soon put in practise the Invention which is set
forth in the Opticks, I beleeve that therefore men ought not to condemn
it; forasmuch as skill and practice are necessary for the making and
compleating the Machines I have described; so that no circumstance
should be wanting.I should no less wonder if they should succeed at
first triall, then if a man should learn in a day to play excellently
well on a Lute, by having an exact piece set before him.And if I write
in French, which is the language of my Country, rather then in Latin,
which is that of my Tutors, 'tis because I hope such who use their meer
naturall reason, wil better judge of my opinions, then those who only
beleeve in old Books.And for those who joyn a right understanding with
study, (who I only wish for my Judges) I assure my self, they will not
be so partiall to the Latin, as to refuse to read my reasons because I
expresse them in a vulgar tongue.To conclude, I will not speak here in particular of the progresse I
hoped to make hereafter in Learning; Nor engage my self by any promise
to the Publick, which I am not certain to perform.But I shall onely
say, That I am resolved to employ the remainder of my life in no other
thing but the study to acquire some such knowledge of Nature as may
furnish us with more certain rules in Physick then we hitherto have had:
And that my inclination drives me so strongly from all other kind of
designes, chiefly from those which cannot be profitable to any, but by
prejudicing others; that if any occasion obliged me to spend my time
therein, I should beleeve I should never succeed therein: which I here
declare, though I well know it conduceth not to make me considerable in
the world; neither is it my ambition to be so.And I shall esteem my
self always more obliged to those by whose favour I shal without
disturbance enjoy my ease, then to them who should proffer me the most
honourable imployment of the earth.+--------------------------------------------------------------+

XIII._THE EARTH'S HOT CENTER._


The following extracts from the report of the Hon.John Flannagan,
United States Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,
published in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully
explain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be
too voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated
the hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.HAMILTON FISH,
                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from
   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the
   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I
   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the
   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the
   following circumstantial report:

   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North
   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of
   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming
   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department
   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government
   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition
   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,
   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to
   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for
   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in
   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous
   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward
   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the
   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the
   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and
   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English
   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,
   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the
   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick
   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great
   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,
   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of
   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the
   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the
   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the
   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board
   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each
   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few
   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of
   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie
   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first
   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;
   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present
   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so
   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an
   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of
   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the
   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the
   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were
   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the
   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of
   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated
   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;
   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,
   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the
   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of
   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at
   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the
   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not
   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific
   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at
   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them
   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its
   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal
   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant
   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of
   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being
   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by
   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe
   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated
   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very
   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its
   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten
   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual
   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly
   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being
   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner
   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this
   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most
   prominent:

   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial
   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago
   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most
   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal
   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a
   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of
   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt
   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases
   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the
   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must
   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,
   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining
   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been
   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant
   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this
   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,
   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines
   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one
   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the
   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred
   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at
   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average
   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in
   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and
   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an
   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in
   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one
   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat
   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree
   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of
   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when
   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed
   from a common source; and

   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change
   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less
   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of
   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and
   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of
   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of
   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could
   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of
   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful
contrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only
a portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:

   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten
   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone
   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the
   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise
   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to
   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that
   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to
   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive
   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by
   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.Turbine wheels were built,
   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the
   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between
   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet
   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the
   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the
   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron
   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred
   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of
   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two
   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected
   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron
   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost
   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the
   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons
   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an
   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed
   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of
   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from
   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the
   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the
   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was
   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that
   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the
   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to
   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the
   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen
   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the
   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were
   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio
   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface
   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at
   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As
   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if
   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some
   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was
   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast
   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of
   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of
   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of
   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon
   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the
   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an
   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,
   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the
   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was
   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the
   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the
   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping
   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a
   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st
   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the
   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of
   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the
   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by
   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment
   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a
   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_
   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse
   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the
   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while
   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred
   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one
   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only
   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing
   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a
   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The
   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being
   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But
   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious
   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was
   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it
   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not
   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at
   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
   of the magnetic clock stopped."But the activity of the needle
   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
   theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
   angles to its current."Hence electricity, from the nature of its
   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000
   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic
   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite
   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery
   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,
   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of
   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize
   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was
   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least
   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest
   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found
   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or
   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of
the earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only
truncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the
latitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the
   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover
   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the
   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two
   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a
   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the
   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous
   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured
   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
   floor of the shaft building!The highest peak of the Himalayas is
   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that
   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the
   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November
   1.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages
   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the
   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were
   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from
   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent
   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon
   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went
   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as
   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much
   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible
   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of
   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,
   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials
   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in
   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another
   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more
   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more
   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,
   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A
   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,
   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious
   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one
   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the
   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and
   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and
   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and
   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on
   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty
   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the
   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed
   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire
   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed
   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were
   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and
   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the
   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,
   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it
   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this
   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,
   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted
   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders
   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he
   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded
   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate
   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they
   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,
   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the
   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are
   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a
   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the
   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the
   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils
   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified
   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous
   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was
   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference
   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest
   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could
   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the
   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,
   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the
   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their
   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant
   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the
   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But
   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,
   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from
   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could
   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this
   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost
   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the
   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most
   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose
   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the
   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in
   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the
   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the
   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on
   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff
   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the
   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only
   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,
   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving
   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly
   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a
   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim
   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever
   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active
   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently
   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as
   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being
   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law
   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could
   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from
   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I
   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and
   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw
   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can
   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to
   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts
   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the
   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature
   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their
   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no
   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could
   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he
   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all
   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the
   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up
   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,
   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds
   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply
   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited
   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal
   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then
   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level
   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than
   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich
   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It
   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten
   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when
   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists
   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its
   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the
   close of the session, the members were equally divided between
   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take
   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed
   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as
   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the
   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet
   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about
   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is
   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch
   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and
   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of
   the United States in originating the work that led to the
   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign
   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State
   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum
   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States
   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by
   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,
   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the
   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,
                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did
   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory
   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and
   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his
   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,
   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of
   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the
   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the
   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of
   basalt."The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to
   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the
   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's
   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of
   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great
   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created
   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained
   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as
   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of
   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw
   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a
   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his
   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be
   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected
   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY'S DREAM._


    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,
          Just fifty years ago,
    And struck in his might, to the left and right,
          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star
          Illumined the dusky air,
    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,
          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,
          Just fifty years ago,
    Of the sins that start in the human heart
          When _its_ metal is all aglow;
    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,
          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,
    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs
          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,
          With center in self alone,
    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,
          In the sweep of its mighty zone;
    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,
          He gazed from his swarthy home,
    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,
          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march
          All peoples went wailing by,
    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,
          To the grave that was yawning nigh,
    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows
          On the iron that was aglow,
    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,
          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,
    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;
    Men of all nations, and of every clime,
    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,
    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,
    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band
    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;
    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,
    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,
    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose
    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;
    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,
    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,
    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,
    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,
    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,
    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,
    And bear upon their airy ramparts old
    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade
    All woes and vices had their coverts made;
    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,
    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,
    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,
    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array
    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,
    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,
    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,
    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,
    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;
    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,
    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,
    And happy only amid war's alarms,
    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;
    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,
    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,
    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;
    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,
    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;
    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,
    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,
    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;
    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;
    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;
    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;
    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;
    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,
    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,
    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;
    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,
    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good
      With an angel by his side,
    And rested his sledge on its iron edge
      And blew up his bellows wide;
    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,
      Then murmured in accent low:
    "All ready am I your bidding to try
      So far as a mortal may go."'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,
      And breathed in his softest tone,
    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air
      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask
      Beyond a mortal's control,
    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs
      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth '<DW41> the sons of the earth,
      And bring me a human heart
    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,
      And acts still a brother's part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait
      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;
    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,
      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,
      But plumed for an angel's flight;
    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled
      When the clouds are alive with light;
    He followed the sun till his race was won,
      And probed every heart and mind;
    But in every zone man labored alone
      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,
      The dreamer returned to his home,
    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,
      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught
      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,
      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side
      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;
    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife
      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,
      And sinful my sorrowing heart;
    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,
      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast
      To the angel's glittering blade;
    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide
      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,
      And buried it deep in the flame
    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell
      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs
      That environ the human soul;
    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might
      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,
      Beat the heart that was all aglow,
    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars
      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge
      Of wounds that were healed long ago;
    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm
      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,
      For the angel was holding the heart,
    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought
      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;
    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,
      _But left on the anvil a chain!_
    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,
      As pure as the fountain of youth;
    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,
      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke
      At the anvil that slept by his side;
    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,
      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,
      Our emblem in age and in youth;
    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,
      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._


By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the
vagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of
loveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive
in the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up
to the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the
imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous
truth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as
we unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in
creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the
mighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,
a boiling flood of lava.Time was not;
for as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun
had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure
concave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but
shot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their
horrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of
the waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable
depths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,
destined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the
laws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned
upon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and
water overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and
decomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This
but prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the
groundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of
all her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet
affections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God
calls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his
sway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven
thrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and
anxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous
word--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of
Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the
west, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa
hills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand
problem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea
of silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of
the setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay
like a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at
intervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of
business I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the
night.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my
profession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to
the cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their
thraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought
came back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,
with its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy
came with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her
Napoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her
commerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw
Russell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,
thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a
cross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but
speechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open
on my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would
then pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and
her apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and
went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in
glittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow
encircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud
above of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled
and subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full
review.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no
means uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,
read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide
heavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an
immense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides
I saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its
summit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in
alternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,
_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,
_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,
_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,
_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the
base of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot
upon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and
swarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly
upward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and
I observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second
layer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me
for observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily
recognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he
reached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I
caught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of
the true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,
and that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in
reality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced
from the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with
folded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as
if about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in
distinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen
to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because
unanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral
sound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and
turning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little
school-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I
spoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "'tis time to proceed
homeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the
evening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking
her proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still
ringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #

Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The
candle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering
glimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and
excited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart
and brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now
perceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were
dense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me
howling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving
billows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his
doubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his
poison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all
the great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the
same thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and
as I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and
again--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart
from Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed
her into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are
woven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits
impassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The
light she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the
bright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the
soul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the
scene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its
lessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was
cased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of
an angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my
conscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my
mental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of
the straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the
poor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely
glancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable
passage in one of Paul's epistles: "That was not _first_ which is
spiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is
spiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection
than at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the
horizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that
the past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the
human soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,
and read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul
evidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its
applicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in
philosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;
that man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is
barren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,
he clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science
is demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first
law, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone
forth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up
like a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that
the shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that
poor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in
thought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had
wandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had
been identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually
decipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral
apparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by
mortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of
the mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the
telescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered
by the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to
their bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,
and he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so
long tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most
unwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be
called sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more
powerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst
my eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and
almost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking
song flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose
shadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I
beheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree
which was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the
branches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its
silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,
spreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding
this, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of
Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It
was in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and
the identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the
top.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or
greets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are
whistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many
moments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it
covered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and
fertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then
came forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the
morn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at
Jerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker
than the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of
time it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes
toward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his
position, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to
be floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His
features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression
of superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the
question came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my
lips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again
I read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a
natural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;
gradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that
which transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now
gleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed
as naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets
and apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind
infatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your
own mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the
idea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and
dismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year
allotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as
science elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,
the natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be
changed in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear
the clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the
dark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my
heart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When
the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent
and abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,
but thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its
wings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when
in terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._


                   I.

    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,
      Have bloomed, and passed away,
    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,
      We spent our wedding-day.Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,
      Joy chased each tear of woe,
    When first we promised to be true,
      That morning long ago.Though many cares have come, dear Sue,
      To checker life's career,
    As down its pathway we have trod,
      In trembling and in fear.Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,
      That lowered o'er the way,
    We clung the closer, while it blew,
      And laughed the clouds away.'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,
      And riches we have not,
    But children gambol round our door,
      And consecrate the spot.Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,
      Our daughters fair and gay,
    But none so beautiful as you,
      Upon our wedding-day.No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,
      No crape festooned the door,
    But health has waved its halcyon wings,
      And plenty filled our store.Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,
      And chase dull cares away,
    And kindle rosy hope anew,
      As on our wedding-day.[Decoration]

XVII._THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._


    One more flutter of time's restless wing,
    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;
    One more step in the journey of fate,
    One more ember gone out in life's grate;
    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,
    One more round in the ladder of age;
    One leaf more in the volume of doom,
    And one span less in the march to the tomb,
    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,
    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.How has thy life been speeding
          Since Aurora, at the dawn,
        Peeped within thy portals, leading
          The babe year, newly born?Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,
          Has some spectre nestled there?And with every new to-morrow,
          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?Burst its chain with strength sublime,
        For behold!I bring another,
          And a fairer child of time.Have thy barns been brimming o'er?Will thy stature fit the niches
          Hewn for Hercules of yore?the rolling planet
          Starts on a nobler round.But perhaps across thy vision
          Death had cast its shadow there,
        And thy home, once all elysian,
          Now crapes an empty chair;
        Or happier, thy dominions,
          Spreading broad and deep and strong,
        Re-echo 'neath love's pinions
          To a pretty cradle song!God's blessing on your head;
        Joy for the living mother,
          Peace with the loving dead.[Decoration]

XVIII._A PAIR OF MYTHS:_

BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained unconscious of
everything occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged
heavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose
state.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder
sleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician
with joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss
Lucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused
me from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something
of the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared
as fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my
shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after
my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no
torpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the
occurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had
happened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my
intended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I
was awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I
smiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late
catastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand
times, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,
remembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he
rushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome
intelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild
with joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and
forehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my
chamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the
nurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the
reader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything
around me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when
consciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and
instead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at
my bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she
might select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual
manner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most
implicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark
in relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what
delighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a
manuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its
history.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for
my brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day
came round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral
essays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled


THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old
toper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great
many very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard
of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of
"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the
display of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was
his strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He
had told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled
incessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once
rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to
eat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,
the fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might
accidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very
long fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great
Sahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must
not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the
little town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he
said so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His
companions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and
gazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,
could nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the
pins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal
had a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start
home.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever
heard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down
tremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set
out.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he
had but a boy to talk to!A verse
that he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into
his mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire
its company.It ran thus:

    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin
       The powers upon him shed,
     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]
       And a talk with Mimir's head!"[B-236]

[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could
sail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and
carry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he
desired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,
however, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,
until finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that
it drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and
demanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_
want with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"
politely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head
was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least
forty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in
close proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me
down to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal
said--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it
might, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took
their places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet you an ounce of
your blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don't bet
_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood's my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in
vain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could
spare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's
appetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest
and his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir's head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head
fall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"
etc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar
and set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran
a few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what
was his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the
ball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head
along--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long
before it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled
down, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he
hurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at
once, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he
said so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,
and drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one
scale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he
grasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his
sleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest
vein he could discover.When he returned to
consciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the
giant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum
of blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he
could scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned
immediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,
like some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never
intimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me
in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the
adventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with
one of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in
story telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect
he originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or
drunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat
the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #

In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous
history of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally
wandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who
I now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of
my destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and
whenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,
lay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the
perusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man's pardon for
declaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps
think the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing
to these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the
story, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal
now?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded
whether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush
assured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she
had whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly
unfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious
condition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of
satisfying it."But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy
as Black Hal's.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray
inform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls
never think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus
attempted to elucidate


THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes
involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring
around me.There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being
in the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment
emerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the
star Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of
the comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very
comfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit
ramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by
the song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and
system to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to
those who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of
hospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice
lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what
evidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:

The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above
the gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was
gone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed
the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that
Paradise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and
smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself
along the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the
fountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I
once enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those
beautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have
flown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array
him in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,
produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all
balm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and
the fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness
greet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every
side.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his
companion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,
we are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles
of Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let
us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn
also the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once
wailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled
from the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among
these groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,
sweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling
waters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when
we have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her
side, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on
earth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and
started eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred
times had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had
trod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain
traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In
vain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's
cold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea
which separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the
far-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the
distance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if
Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,
and set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,
with the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her
lip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was
unsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean
soon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,
and the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked
feet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid
seemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every
motion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph
Happiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of
Eden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy
lovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their
bosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;
neither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the
sought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in
the vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou
wilt.This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate."A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her
sleep a vision came to comfort her.She dreamed that she stood before an
aged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom."Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"and then she burst into a
flood of tears."Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the old man; "Happiness yet
dwells on earth, but she is no longer visible.A temple is built for her
in every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed
there by the child of Honor and Love."The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the
memory of her dream."I will return to Eden, and there await until the
child of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and
thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in
verdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the
warbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers
approached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed
through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.A hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had
resounded through the deserted groves.At length the dusky figures
emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into
each other's faces.One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each
other's arms.Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished
hers.But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to
his bosom, exclaimed:

"There is no mystery here, my Eve.If Happiness on earth be indeed the
child of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone.What else now
left us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon?Approved by heaven,
and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;
and if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!"They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though
the garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an
angel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of
Matrimony.[Decoration]

XIX._THE LAST OF HIS RACE._


    No further can fate tempt or try me,
      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;
    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,
      The last of my race I remain.To that home so long left I might journey;
      But they for whose greeting I yearn,
    Are launched on that shadowy ocean
      Whence voyagers never return.My life is a blank in creation,
      My fortunes no kindred may share;
    No brother to cheer desolation,
      No sister to soften by prayer;
    No father to gladden my triumphs,
      No mother my sins to atone;
    No children to lean on in dying--
      I must finish my journey alone!In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,
      How lone would now echo my tread!While each fading portrait threw o'er me
      The chill, stony smile of the dead.One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,
      From eve till the coming of dawn:
    I cry out in visions, "_Where are they_?"And echo responds, "_They are gone_!"But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,
      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,
    That row of green hillocks, where moulder
      The rest of my early doom'd race.There slumber the true and the manly,
      There slumber the spotless and fair;
    And when my last journey is ended,
      My place of repose be it there![Decoration]

XX._THE TWO GEORGES._


Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on
opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert
a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to
control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.It will
be the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two
individuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and
show how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,
whilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with
immortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the
guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of
England.It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734.Some joyful event
must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire.Nor is the circumstance of a
private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is
illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron
throats.The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee.Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on
a commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest
towers of St.James's Palace the national ensigns of St.George and the
Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze.Within one of the most
gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son.The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended.The corridors are thronged with dukes,
and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple
knee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world.A
Royal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding
British subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to
rejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great
Britain and Ireland.Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended
the throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a
scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character.It is the 22d February, 1732.The locality is a distant
colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with
clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards.Snow covers the
ground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning
through the forest.Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the
house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality
within, totally in contrast with external nature.There are but four
small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of
Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son.No dukes or
marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.There are no
princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom.His first
breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden
with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains."But the child is received from its Mother's womb by
hands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,
indicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.He, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took
command of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only
the language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as
caprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.The peasant
boy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was
honorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health.He early
learned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a
stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of
untamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns.Truth,
courage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's
counsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's
example, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over
extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district
surveyor.Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us
now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of either.For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all
the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching
in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana.The English strenuously
denied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,
commenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg
stands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them
from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary
to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and
demand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,
and order him immediately to evacuate the territory.George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by
the Governor for this important mission.It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery
march through the wilderness.The historian of his life has painted in
imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in
the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.The
memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.How
often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on
his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero!with what fervent prayers
do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of
the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.Standing
bareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was
broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling
current.for the destinies of millions yet
unborn hang upon that noble arm!In the early part of the year 1764 a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly
irritated.A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that
the monarch is sick.His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,
and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.Yet he has
no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step
along the corridors of the palace.His conduct becomes gradually more
and more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal
medical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that
the King is threatened with _insanity_.For six weeks the cloud obscures
his mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the
administration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the
future.His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,
and a radical cure impossible.Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and
George Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during
the struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first
indignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a
king.Not long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the
chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the
French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of
lieutenant-colonel.Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he
was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his
own.Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in
Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,
and his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
_under the command of favorite officers_.An
edict soon followed, denominated an "Order to settle the rank of the
officers of His Majesty's forces serving in America."By one of the
articles of this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade
commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their
commissions might be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy
no rank at all."This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the
ink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in
vain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the
defenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly
replied: "I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor."In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp
Act.This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual
resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia.The
leading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barre, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city
of London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the
Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act."It is with the utmost
astonishment," replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects capable
of encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some
of my North American colonies.Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue
those measures which they have recommended for the support of the
constitutional rights of Great Britain."He heeded not the memorable
words of Burke, that afterward became prophetic."There are moments,"
exclaimed this great statesman, "critical moments in the fortunes of all
states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may
yet be strong enough to complete your ruin."The Boston port bill
passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that
George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man
in his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of
cruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the
soul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable
justice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince
England that her revolted colonists were invincible.It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at
the gate of St.James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named
Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of
the King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life.On the 29th
October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,
a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.James the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat.The state carriage was
completely demolished by the mob.But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that
George the Third made his narrowest escapes.In the morning of that
day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one
of the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the
King.The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear.In the evening of the same day a
more alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre.At the
moment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a
large horse-pistol at him.The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown
up by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of
the King.Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on
the 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic.In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the
most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the
English throne.He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was
hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a
despot to the grave.His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,
in few words: "Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to
be his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in
perilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.His interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the
case of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous._The
separation of America from the mother country, at the time it took
place, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference
with the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,
attributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England.His
obstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and
threatened the dismemberment of the kingdom.He has been often praised
for firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of
obstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a
resolution once formed."The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last
resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to
one of light.Let us now return to the career of Washington.Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of
millions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.Honored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from
thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and
best of the world's benefactors.Assassins did not unglory him in life,
nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death.The names of his
great battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have
imbedded themselves forever in the national character.Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory.His mementoes are everywhere
around and about us.Distant as we are from the green fields of his
native Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our
borders.In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on
shores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face
of liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused
perhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,
this day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the
gleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of
heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles
in his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the
enslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice
to his memory.Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in
discharging this debt of national gratitude.With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter
could feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of
purchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel
over his remains.ye daughters
of America; enfold them closer to your bosom than your first-born
offspring; build around them a mausoleum that neither time nor change
can overthrow; for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn.Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan
head, wherever treason shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion
shall unfurl its tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the
hearts of patriots and republicans!For from these pale ashes there
shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the
plains of Heber, vast armies of invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar
and tomb at Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!_MASONRY._


    Oh, sacred spirit of Masonic love,
    Offspring of Heaven, the angels' bond above,
    Guardian of peace and every social tie,
    How deep the sources of thy fountains lie!How wide the realms that 'neath thy wings expand,
    Embracing every clime, encircling every land!Beneath the aurora of the Polar skies,
    Where Greenland's everlasting glaciers rise,
    The Lodge mysterious lifts its snow-built dome,
    And points the brother to a sunnier home;
    Where Nilus slays the sacrificial kid,
    Beneath the shadow of her pyramid,
    Where magian suns unclasp the gaping ground,
    And far Australia's golden sands abound;
    Where breakers thunder on the coral strand,
    To guard the gates of Kamehameha's land;
    Wherever man, in lambskin garb arrayed,
    Strikes in defense of innocence betrayed;
    Lifts the broad shield of charity to all,
    And bends in anguish o'er a brother's fall;
    Where the bright symbol of Masonic truth,
    Alike for high and low, for age or youth,
    Flames like yon sun at tropic midday's call,
    And opes the universal eye on all!What though in secret all your alms be done,
    Your foes all vanquished and your trophies won?What though a veil be o'er your Lodges thrown,
    And brother only be to brother known?In secret, God built up the rolling world;
    In secret, morning's banners are unfurled;
    In secret, spreads the leaf, unfolds the flower,
    Revolve the spheres, and speeds the passing hour.The day is noise, confusion, strife, turmoil,
    Struggles for bread, and sweat beneath the toil.The night is silence--progress without jars,
    The rest of mortals and the march of stars!The day for work to toiling man was given;
    But night, to lead his erring steps to Heaven.Who feed the hungry, heed the orphan's cry;
    Who clothe the naked, dry the widow's tear,
    Befriend the exile, bear the stranger's bier;
    Stand round the bedside when the fluttering soul
    Bursts her clay bonds and parteth for her goal;
    God speed you in the noble path you tread,
    Friends of the living, mourners o'er the dead.May all your actions, measured on the square,
    Be just and righteous, merciful and fair;
    Your thoughts flow pure, in modesty of mind,
    Along the equal level of mankind;
    Your words be troweled to truth's perfect tone,
    Your fame be chiseled in unblemished stone,
    Your hearts be modeled on the plummet's line,
    Your faith be guided by the Book divine;
    And when at last the gavel's beat above
    Calls you from labor to the feast of love,
    May mighty Boaz, pillar'd at that gate
    Which seraphs tyle and where archangels wait,
    Unloose the bandage from your dazzled eyes,
    Spell out the _Password_ to Arch-Royal skies;
    Upon your bosom set the signet steel,
    Help's sign disclose, and Friendship's grip reveal;
    Place in your grasp the soul's unerring rod,
    And light you to the Temple of your God!_POLLOCK'S EUTHANASIA._


    He is gone!By his own strong pinions lifted

    Where he strikes, with minstrels olden,

                      Deathless bars.There, with Homer's ghost all hoary,
    Not with years, but fadeless glory,
                      Lo!he stands;

    And through that open portal,

                      In the skies!Albion's blind old bard heroic,
    Statesman, sage, and Christian stoic,
                      Greets his son;

    Whilst in paeans wild and glorious,
    Like his "Paradise victorious,"

    But with glory's beams resplendent
                      As a star;

    Slow descends from regions higher,
    With a crown and golden lyre
                      In his car.All around him, crowd as minions,
    Thrones and sceptres, and dominions,
                      Kings and Queens;

    Ages past and ages present,
    Lord and dame, and prince and peasant,
                      His demesnes!young bard hesperian,
    Welcome to the heights empyrean,
                      Thou did'st sing,

    Ere yet thy trembling fingers
    Struck where fame immortal lingers,
                      In the string.I am the bard of Avon,
    And the Realm of song in Heaven
                      Is my own;

    Long thy verse shall live in story,
    And thy Lyre I crown with glory,
                      And a throne!_SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY._


Looking back into the past, and exploring by the light of authentic
history, sacred as well as profane, the characteristics of former ages,
the merest tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain epochs
stand prominently out on the "sands of time," and indicate vast activity
and uncommon power in the human mind.These epochs are so well marked that history has given them a
designation, and to call them by their name, conjures up, as by the wand
of an enchanter, the heroic representatives of our race.If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon, in sacred
history, the memory would instantly picture forth the pinnacles of the
Holy Temple, lifting themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen
intently to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David, vocal at
once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and swelling into sublime
ecstasy at the final redemption of his people; the eye would glisten at
the pomp and pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his court,
and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the young Queen of Sheba, who
journeyed from a distant land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne.We should behold his ships
traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of
Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the
East.So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be
giants, and their minds inspired.What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?We mean all that is
glorious in the annals of Greece.We mean Apelles with his pencil,
Phidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword.We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the
divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward
the theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is
presenting his tragedies.Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious
chariot.The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge
in blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us.The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus
and Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,
statesmen, and orators.Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the
greatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest
orator, and the greatest statesman of Rome.Caesar and Cicero, Virgil and
Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their
blended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.Italy and Spain and France and England have had their golden age.The
eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis
Quatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten.They loom up from the
surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;
irradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,
and dimming the lustre of the brightest stars.History has also left in
its track mementoes of a different character.In sacred history we have
the age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero.We recognize at a glance
the talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the
Crusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to
the reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout
Christendom as the "Dark Ages."Let us now take a survey of the field we
occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall
be ranked by our posterity.But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let
us define more especially what that epoch embraces.It does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it
include the acts or heroes of either.The impetus given to the human
mind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth.The
first was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost
uninterrupted peace.The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm
belong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds.Hence the wars of
Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from
observation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.De Stael and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,
Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;
Canova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning
of this century, belong essentially to a former era.They were the
ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first
took form on the 4th day of July, 1776.Our era properly commences with
the downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected
therewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in
the epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period.Ages
hence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of
the nineteenth century:

  "The normal state of Christendom was peace.The age of steel that
  immediately went before it had passed."Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility
  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths
  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly
  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_.The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against
  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new
  trial granted.The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg
  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew
  before the bar of public opinion.The head of Oliver Cromwell was
  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the
  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII
  against the'starry Galileo' reversed forever.Aristotle was
  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In
  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and
  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.Germany led the van, and
  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times."Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present
time, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,
shall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of
bygone generations.Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and
test its accuracy by exemplifications.I. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_?Locke has been
completely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all
speculative moral philosophy exploded.The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr.Wayland in their
discourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,
inquisitively demand, "_Cui bono_?"How can
we apply it to the every-day concerns of life?We ask you for bread and
you have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is
valueless, except for its glitter.No philosopher can speculate
successfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every
turn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who
clips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an
offer of copartnership to "speculate," it may be, in the price of pork.Hence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any
theory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment.Each school
rises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in
toss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its
crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.As with its
predecessor, so with itself."The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages."But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_.It is
true that more books are written and published, more newspapers and
periodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected
and incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any
former period of the world's history.In looking about us we are
forcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--

    "That those who cannot write, and those who can,
     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,
all the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his
eyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and
his years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual
product of the press of Christendom at the present day.It is no figure
of rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its
labors.Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak
out, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to
which they would solemnly respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"A recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating
to the book trade in our own country: "Books have multiplied to such an
extent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000
engines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and
night, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers.These
tireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.It
requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus
340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year.There
are about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000
book-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum
to the public."It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is
declining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful
extent.Byron wrote:

    "'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."True enough; but books are not always literature.A man may become an
author without ceasing to be an ignoramus.His name may adorn a
title-page without being recorded _in aere perenne_.He may attempt to
write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst good master Slender
may be busily engaged "in writing him down an ass."Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand
wreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up
into the region of the immortals.Tell me, ye who prate about the
_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists?Whose
are

    "The great, the immortal names
     That were not born to die?"I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold
hundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals.They
jostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush
onward and upward.One, it may be two, of the million who started out,
stand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for
admittance.One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the
other, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he
enters, is transformed into imperishable stone.Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and
select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen
as it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall
drink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the
sceptre?--who wears the crown?America, England, France and Germany can
boast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single
poet.The _poeta nascitur_ is not here.He may be on his way--and I have
heard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives.Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his "Dove"?Is it Bryant,
with his "Thanatopsis," or Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"?Perhaps it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow, with his
"Idyls."is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is
utterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find
him?True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,
in abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the
everlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the
pet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and
harmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into
sublimity like the storm-swept sea.Beranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere
song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and
lyrist.Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor
Hugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,
Burke or Patrick Henry?I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor
Lamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.But Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a
mere debater, and the spokesman of a party.He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last
century.And in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of
that burly old bully, Dr.and yet Johnson, with all his
learning, was a third-rate philosopher.In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist.Beyond all
controversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of
our times.With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;
with a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a
standard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a
learning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still lacks the giant
grasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest
enthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and
identify them with the eras they adorn.As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the
_Fine Arts_.The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,
or composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua
Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been
superseded by <DW64> minstrelsy and senseless pantomime.The greatest
architect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a
cobbler of French farces.But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has
been left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next
highest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has
been stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact.Within its
chosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have
preceded it.It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors.It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood.It
disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the
manufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an
agricultural experiment.It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no
appreciation of the sublime.It stands upon the ocean shore, but with
its eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold.It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an
ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!"Having no
soul to save, it has no religion to save it.It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,
after all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,
his fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else.It does not
believe in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible.It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the
chronology of the third.It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;
it must "touch and handle" before it will believe.It questions the
existence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;
it questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.It does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the
evaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the
heels of the lightnings.It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find
out) through all its voices, moods and tenses.It invents everything;
from a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through
all the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope
that spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus
in its inventions.It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for
a pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of
oil.From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a
columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it
oscillates like a pendulum.Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in
science.Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life."I
want to know," is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,
the crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it
is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."Our age has inherited the
chief failing of our first mother, and passing by the "Tree of Life in
the midst of the Garden," we are all busily engaged in mercilessly
plundering the Tree of Knowledge of all its fruit.The time is rapidly
approaching when no man will be considered a gentleman who has not filed
his _caveat_ in the Patent Office.The inevitable result of this spirit of the age begins already to be
seen.The philosophy of a cold, blank, calculating materialism has taken
possession of all the avenues of learning.Epicurus is worshiped instead
of Christ.Mammon is considered as the only true savior._Dum Vivimus
Vivamus_, is the maxim we live by, and the creed we die by.Peter has
surrendered his keys to that great incarnate representative of this age,

XXIV._THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._


    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,
      The sword in its scabbard lay still,
    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit
      That crimson-dyed river and rill,
    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,
      To gladden the world with her smile,
    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,
      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,
      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--
    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece
      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;
    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod
      In virginal beauty below;
    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,
      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,
      Remembering the footprints of old
    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,
      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told."I am naked," she cried; "I am homeless on earth;
      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,
    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,
      And condemned to the region of snows."hail"--our fathers exclaim--
      "To the glorious land of the West!With a diadem bright we will honor thy name,
      And enthrone thee America's guest;
    We will found a great nation and call it thine own,
      And erect here an altar to thee,
    Where millions shall kneel at the foot of thy throne
      And swear to forever be free!"Then each brought a vestment her form to enrobe,
      And screen her fair face from the sun,
    And thus she stood forth as the Queen of the globe
      When the work of our Fathers was done.A circlet of stars round her temples they wove,
      That gleamed like Orion's bright band,
    And an emblem of power, the eagle of Jove,
      They perched like a bolt in her hand;
    On her forehead, a scroll that contained but a line
      Was written in letters of light,
    That our great "Constitution" forever might shine,
      A sun to illumine the night.Her feet were incased in broad sandals of gold,
      That riches might spring in her train;
    While a warrior's casque, with its visor uproll'd,
      Protected her tresses and brain;
    Round her waist a bright girdle of satin was bound,
      Formed of colors so blended and true,
    That when as a banner the scarf was unwound,
      It floated the "Red, White and Blue."Then Liberty calm, leant on Washington's arm,
      And spoke in prophetical strain:
    "Columbia's proud hills I will shelter from ills,
      Whilst her valleys and mountains remain;
    But palsied the hand that would pillage the band
      Of sisterhood stars in my crown,
    And death to the knave whose sword would enslave,
      By striking your great charter down."Your eagle shall soar this western world o'er,
      And carry the sound of my name,
    Till monarchs shall quake and its confines forsake,
      If true to your ancestral fame!Your banner shall gleam like the polar star's beam,
      To guide through rebellion's Red sea,
    And in battle 'twill wave, both to conquer and save,
      If borne by the hands of the free!"[Decoration]

XXV._A CAKE OF SOAP._


    I stood at my washstand, one bright sunny morn,
    And gazed through the blinds at the upbringing corn,
    And mourn'd that my summers were passing away,
    Like the dew on the meadow that morning in May.I seized, for an instant, the Iris-hued soap,
    That glowed in the dish, like an emblem of hope,
    And said to myself, as I melted its snows,
    "The longer I use it, the lesser it grows."For life, in its morn, is full freighted and gay,
    And fair as the rainbow when clouds float away;
    Sweet-scented and useful, it sheds its perfume,
    Till wasted or blasted, it melts in the tomb.Thus day after day, whilst we lather and scrub,
    Time wasteth and blasteth with many a rub,
    Till thinner and thinner, the soap wears away,
    And age hands us over to dust and decay.as I dream of thee now,
    With the spice in thy breath, and the bloom on thy brow,
    To a cake of pure Lubin thy life I compare,
    So fragrant, so fragile, and so debonair!But fortune was fickle, and labor was vain,
    And want overtook us, with grief in its train,
    Till, worn out by troubles, death came in the blast;
    But _thy_ kisses, like Lubin's, were sweet to the last!_THE SUMMERFIELD CASE._


The following additional particulars, as sequel to the Summerfield
homicide, have been furnished by an Auburn correspondent:

  MR.EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,
  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to
  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic
  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
  in California.Before proceeding to relate in detail the late
  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of
  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most
  profound and contradictory character.I, for one, halted between
  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent
  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific
  authenticity of the facts related.The doubt with which the story was at first received in this
  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an
  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has
  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that
  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate.Too
  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the
  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the
  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has
  been issued.--P.PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.=$10,000 REWARD!=

                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the
    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the
    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
    familiarly known as Black Bart.Said Graham is accused of the
    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on
    the 14th ultimo.He is five feet ten inches and a half in
    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,
    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in
    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the
    Confederate army.He may be lurking in some of the
    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster
    during the Comstock excitement.The above reward will be paid
    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an
    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield.By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,
                                            Secretary of State.Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.Our correspondent continues:

  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in
  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but
  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of
  the editor above alluded to.But I am detaining you from more
  important matters.Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the
  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on
  the same errand, but without any previous conference.Two of these
  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
  or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."Gillson kept a saloon
  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and
  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the
  Norfolk livery stable.Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his
  untimely end.As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his
  antecedents.It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of
  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an
  habitual gambler.Only one thing about him is certainly well
  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served
  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.He was a man
  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;
  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and
  left him but a wreck of himself.But he was not incapable of
  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of
  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies
  from the flames.In so doing he scorched his left hand so
  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very
  scar may lead to his apprehension.There is no doubt about his
  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will
  probably be not alive.So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses
  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of
  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:


                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My
    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife
    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North
    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's
    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin
    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at
    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from
    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain
    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for
    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one
    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning
    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place
    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered
    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),
    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so
    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan
    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his
    eyes, and begged me, "For God's sake, give me a drop of
    water!"I asked him, "What is the matter?"He replied, "I am
    shot in the back."Without waiting to question him further, I returned
    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and
    sent her off on a run for the men.Taking with me a gourd of
    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman
    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back
    to his side, where I remained until "father"--as we all call
    my husband--came with the men.We removed him as gently as we
    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr.Liebner, and nursed him
    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken
    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A.Q. Did you see him sign it?--A.Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A.(Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name
    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams
    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my
    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last
    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a
    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must
    go for father and the boys immediately.I ran as fast as my
    legs would carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they
    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the
    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday
    sundown, when he died.A. He did
    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more
    audibly and intelligibly.A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the
    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;
    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of
    all sent for the doctor.A. Only myself; he had
    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to
    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and
    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!or he'll set
    the world afire!His tone of voice
    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he
    cried "fire!"his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his
    body convulsed, and before Mrs.Gillson could reach his
    bedside he fell back stone dead.(Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of
  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of
  his demoniac ravings.He would taste nothing from a glass or
  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
  eyes.In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,
  tumblers, and even the castors.At times he spoke rationally, but
  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the
  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his
  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:


    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and
    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the
    most part flighty and in a comatose condition.The wound was
    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball
    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces.It
    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,
    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the
    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the
    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,
    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the
    xiphoid portion of the sternum.Necessarily fatal, there was
    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a
    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect
    of the wound he ultimately died.I witnessed the execution of
    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his
    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his
    perfect senses.It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,
    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read
    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature.I was
    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away
    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his
    bedside shortly afterward.In my judgment, no amount of care
    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a
    few days.(Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.


  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as
  follows:


    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }
                  _vs._               }
            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }_Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken
    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._

    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left
    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the
    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,
    since deceased.It was not fully light when I reached the
    track of the Central Pacific Railroad.Having mined at an
    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky
    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the
    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.One was
    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the
    canyon below.I chose the latter, as being the freest from the
    chance of observation.It required the greatest caution to
    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky
    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the
    railroad.It was now broad daylight, and I commenced
    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.There is quite a
    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the
    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision
    even at a short distance.Brushing aside a thick manzanita
    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that
    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot.It
    was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black Bart."We suddenly
    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying
    exactly between us.Graham
    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we
    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse
    whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that
    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly
    as I bid you, as long as you live!"Fate sat there, cold and
    remorseless as stone.I hesitated; with his left hand he
    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
    handle of a navy revolver.As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his
    brow darkened into a scowl."As your confederate," I answered,
    "never as your slave."The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.The
    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of
    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty.Snow and ice
    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed
    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the
    entrails.But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to
    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of
    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory
    Summerfield.But they did
    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost
    froze my blood.In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,
    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed
    vial which was the object of our mutual visit.Graham fell
    upon his knees, and attempted to withdraw the prize from the
    grasp of its dead possessor.But the bones were firm, and when
    he finally succeeded in securing the bottle, by a sudden
    wrench, I heard the skeleton fingers snap like pipe-stems."Hold this a moment, whilst I search the pockets," he
    commanded.He then turned over the corpse, and thrusting his hand into
    the inner breast-pocket, dragged out a roll of MSS., matted
    closely together and stained by the winter's rains.A further
    search eventuated in finding a roll of small gold coin, a set
    of deringer pistols, a mated double-edged dirk, and a pair of
    silver-mounted spectacles.Hastily covering over the body with
    leaves and branches cut from the embowering shrubs, we
    shudderingly left the spot.We slowly descended the gorge toward the banks of the American
    River, until we arrived in a small but sequestered thicket,
    where we threw ourselves upon the ground.Neither had spoken a
    word since we left the scene above described.Graham was the
    first to break the silence which to me had become oppressive."Let us examine the vial and see if the contents are safe."I drew it forth from my pocket and handed it to him."Sealed hermetically, and perfectly secure," he added.Saying
    this he deliberately wrapped it up in a handkerchief and
    placed it in his bosom.As he said this he laughed derisively, and cut
    a most scornful and threatening glance toward me."Yes," I rejoined firmly; "_our_ prize!""Gillson," retorted Graham, "you must regard me as a
    consummate simpleton, or yourself a Goliah.This bottle is
    mine, and _mine_ only.It is a great fortune for _one_, but of
    less value than a toadstool for _two_.I am willing to divide
    fairly.This secret would be of no service to a coward.He
    would not dare to use it.Your share of the robbery of the
    body shall be these MSS.; you can sell them to some poor devil
    of a printer, and pay yourself for your day's work."Saying this he threw the bundle of MSS.at my feet; but I
    disdained to touch them.Observing this, he gathered them up
    safely and replaced them in his pocket."As you are unarmed,"
    he said, "it would not be safe for you to be seen in this
    neighborhood during daylight.We will both spend the night
    here, and just before morning return to Auburn.I will
    accompany you part of the distance."With the _sangfroid_ of a perfect desperado, he then stretched
    himself out in the shadow of a small tree, drank deeply from a
    whisky flagon which he produced, and pulling his hat over his
    eyes, was soon asleep and snoring.It was a long time before I
    could believe the evidence of my own senses.Finally, I
    approached the ruffian, and placed my hand on his shoulder.He
    did not stir a muscle.I listened; I heard only the deep, slow
    breathing of profound slumber.Resolved not to be balked and
    defrauded by such a scoundrel, I stealthily withdrew the vial
    from his pocket, and sprang to my feet, just in time to hear
    the click of a revolver behind me.I remember
    only a dash and an explosion--a deathly sensation, a whirl of
    the rocks and trees about me, a hideous imprecation from the
    lips of my murderer, and I fell senseless to the earth.When I
    awoke to consciousness it was past midnight.I looked up at
    the stars, and recognized Lyra shining full in my face.That
    constellation I knew passed the meridian at this season of the
    year after twelve o'clock, and its slow march told me that
    many weary hours would intervene before daylight.My right arm
    was paralyzed, but I put forth my left, and it rested in a
    pool of my own blood.I
    exclaimed, faintly; but only the low sighing of the night
    blast responded.Shortly after daylight I
    revived, and crawled to the spot where I was discovered on the
    next day by the kind mistress of this cabin.I accuse Bartholomew Graham of my assassination.I do
    this in the perfect possession of my senses, and with a full
    sense of my responsibility to Almighty God.(Signed)                        C. P. GILLSON.GEORGE SIMPSON, Notary Public.KARL LIEBNER,}

  of MSS.which had been thrown in at the transom over the door,
  labeled, "The Summerfield MSS."Attached to them was an unsealed
  note from one Bartholomew Graham, in these words:

    DEAR SIR: These are yours: you have earned them.I commend
    to your especial notice the one styled "_De Mundo Comburendo_."At a future time you may hear again from

                                            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.A casual glance at the papers convinces me that they are of great
  literary value.Summerfield's fame never burned so brightly as it
  does over this grave.[Decoration]

XXVII._THE AVITOR._


    Hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the nerves that never quail;
    For the heart that beats in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      Where the eagle's breath would fail!As the genii bore Aladdin away,
      In search of his palace fair,
    On his magical wings to the land of Cathay,
    So here I will spread out my pinions to-day
      On the cloud-borne billows of air.to its home on the mountain crag,
      Where the condor builds its nest,
    I mount far fleeter than hunted stag,
    I float far higher than Switzer flag--
      Hurrah for the lightning's guest!Away, over steeple and cross and tower--
      Away, over river and sea;
    I spurn at my feet the tempests that lower,
    Like minions base of a vanquished power,
      And mutter their thunders at me!Diablo frowns, as above him I pass,
      Still loftier heights to attain;
    Calaveras' groves are but blades of grass--
    Yosemite's sentinel peaks a mass
      Of ant-hills dotting a plain!Sierra Nevada's shroud of snow,
      And Utah's desert of sand,
    Shall never again turn backward the flow
    Of that human tide which may come and go
      To the vales of the sunset land!Wherever the coy earth veils her face
      With tresses of forest hair;
    Where polar pallors her blushes efface,
    Or tropical blooms lend her beauty and grace--
      I can flutter my plumage there!Where the Amazon rolls through a mystical land--
      Where Chiapas buried her dead--
    Where Central Australian deserts expand--
    Where Africa seethes in saharas of sand--
      Even there shall my pinions spread!No longer shall earth with her secrets beguile,
      For I, with undazzled eyes,
    Will trace to their sources the Niger and Nile,
    And stand without dread on the boreal isle,
      The Colon of the skies!Then hurrah for the wings that never tire--
      For the sinews that never quail;
    For the heart that throbs in a bosom of fire--
    For the lungs whose cast-iron lobes respire
      When the eagle's breath would fail![Decoration]


XXVIII._LOST AND FOUND._


    'Twas eventide in Eden.The mortals stood,
    Watchful and solemn, in speechless sorrow bound.He was erect, defiant, and unblenched.Tho' fallen, free--deceived, but not undone.She leaned on him, and drooped her pensive brow
    In token of the character she bore--
    _The world's first penitent_.Tears, gushing fast,
    Streamed from her azure eyes; and as they fled
    Beyond the eastern gate, where gleamed the swords
    Of guarding Cherubim, the flowers themselves
    Bent their sad heads, surcharged with dewy tears,
    Wept by the stare o'er man's immortal woe.Far had they wandered, slow had been the pace,
    Grief at his heart and ruin on her face,
    Ere Adam turned to contemplate the spot
    Where Earth began, where Heaven was forgot.He gazed in silence, till the crystal wall
    Of Eden trembled, as though doomed to fall:
    Then bidding Eve direct her tear-dimmed eye
    To where the foliage kissed the western sky,
    They saw, with horror mingled with surprise,
    The wall, the garden, and the foliage rise!Slowly it mounted to the vaulted dome,
    And paused as if to beckon mortals home;
    Then, like a cloud when winds are all at rest,
    It floated gently to the distant west,
    And left behind a crimson path of light,
    By which to track the Garden in its flight!Day after day, the exiles wandered on,
    With eyes still fixed, where Eden's smile last shone;
    Forlorn and friendless through the wilds they trod,
    Remembering Eden, but forgetting God,
    Till far across the sea-washed, arid plain,
    The billows thundered that the search was vain!who can tell how oft at eventide,
    When the gay west was blushing like a bride,
    Fair Eve hath whispered in her children's ear,
    "Beyond yon cloud will Eden reappear!"And thus, as slow millenniums rolled away,
    Each generation, ere it turned to clay,
    Has with prophetic lore, by nature blest,
    In search of Eden wandered to the West.I cast my thoughts far up the stream of time,
    And catch its murmurs in my careless rhyme.I hear a footstep tripping o'er the down:
    Behold!In fancy now her splendors reappear;
    Her fleets and phalanxes, her shield and spear;
    Her battle-fields, blest ever by the free,--
    Proud Marathon, and sad Thermopylae!Her poet, foremost in the ranks of fame,
    Homer!a god--but with a mortal's name;
    Historians, richest in primeval lore;
    Orations, sounding yet from shore to shore!Heroes and statesmen throng the enraptured gaze,
    Till glory totters 'neath her load of praise.Surely a clime so rich in old renown
    Could build an Eden, if not woo one down!Plato comes, with wisdom's scroll unfurl'd,
    The proudest gift of Athens to the world!Wisest of mortals, say, for thou can'st tell,
    Thou, whose sweet lips the Muses loved so well,
    Was Greece the Garden that our fathers trod;
    When men, like angels, walked the earth with God?the great Philosopher replied,
    "Though I love Athens better than a bride,
    Her laws are bloody and her children slaves;
    Her sages slumber in empoisoned graves;
    Her soil is sterile, barren are her seas;
    Eden still blooms in the Hesperides,
    Beyond the pillars of far Hercules!Westward, amid the ocean's blandest smile,
    Atlantis blossoms, a perennial Isle;
    A vast Republic stretching far and wide,
    Greater than Greece and Macedon beside!"Across the mental screen
    A mightier spirit stalks upon the scene;
    His tread shakes empires ancient as the sun;
    His voice resounds, and nations are undone;
    War in his tone and battle in his eye,
    The world in arms, a Roman dare defy!Throned on the summit of the seven hills,
    He bathes his gory heel in Tiber's rills;
    Stretches his arms across a triple zone,
    And dares be master of mankind, alone!All peoples send their tribute to his store;
    Wherever rivers glide or surges roar,
    Or mountains rise or desert plains expand,
    His minions sack and pillage every land.But not alone for rapine and for war
    The Roman eagle spreads his pinions far;
    He bears a sceptre in his talons strong,
    To guard the right, to rectify the wrong,
    And carries high, in his imperial beak,
    A shield armored to protect the weak.Justice and law are dropping from his wing,
    Equal alike for consul, serf or king;
    Daggers for tyrants, for patriot-heroes fame,
    Attend like menials on the Roman name!Was Rome the Eden of our ancient state,
    Just in her laws, in her dominion great,
    Wise in her counsels, matchless in her worth,
    Acknowledged great proconsul of the earth?An eye prophetic that has read the leaves
    The sibyls scattered from their loosened sheaves,
    A bard that sang at Rome in all her pride,
    Shall give response;--let Seneca decide!"Beyond the rocks where Shetland's breakers roar,
    And clothe in foam the wailing, ice-bound shore,
    Within the bosom of a tranquil sea,
    Where Earth has reared her _Ultima Thule_,
    The gorgeous West conceals a golden clime,
    The petted child, the paragon of Time!In distant years, when Ocean's mountain wave
    Shall rock a cradle, not upheave a grave,
    When men shall walk the pathway of the brine,
    With feet as safe as Terra watches mine,
    Then shall the barriers of the Western Sea
    Despised and broken down forever be;
    Then man shall spurn old Ocean's loftiest crest,
    And tear the secret from his stormy breast!"Night settles down
    And shrouds the world in black Plutonian frown;
    Earth staggers on, like mourners to a tomb,
    Wrapt in one long millennium of gloom.That past, the light breaks through the clouds of war,
    And drives the mists of Bigotry afar;
    Amalfi sees her burial tomes unfurl'd,
    And dead Justinian rules again the world.The torch of Science is illumed once more;
    Adventure gazes from the surf-beat shore,
    Lifts in his arms the wave-worn Genoese,
    And hails Iberia, Mistress of the Seas!What cry resounds along the Western main,
    Mounts to the stars, is echoed back again,
    And wakes the voices of the startled sea,
    Dumb until now, from past eternity?is chanted from the Pinta's deck;
    Smiling afar, a minute glory-speck,
    But grandly rising from the convex sea,
    To crown Colon with immortality,
    The Western World emerges from the wave,
    God's last asylum for the free and brave!But where within this ocean-bounded clime,
    This fairest offspring of the womb of time,--
    Plato's Atlantis, risen from the sea,
    Utopia's realm, beyond old Rome's Thule,--
    Where shall we find, within this giant land,
    By blood redeemed, with Freedom's rainbow spann'd,
    The spot first trod by mortals on the earth,
    Where Adam's race was cradled into birth?'Twas sought by Cortez with his warrior band,
    In realms once ruled by Montezuma's hand;
    Where the old Aztec, 'neath his hills of snow,
    Built the bright domes of silver Mexico.Pizarro sought it where the Inca's rod
    Proclaimed the prince half-mortal, demi-god,
    When the mild children of unblest Peru
    Before the bloodhounds of the conqueror flew,
    And saw their country and their race undone,
    And perish 'neath the Temple of the Sun!De Soto sought it, with his tawny bride,
    Near where the Mississippi's waters glide,
    Beneath the ripples of whose yellow wave
    He found at last both monument and grave.Old Ponce de Leon, in the land of flowers,
    Searched long for Eden'midst her groves and bowers,
    Whilst brave La Salle, where Texan prairies smile,
    Roamed westward still, to reach the happy isle.The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower's deck,
    Fleeing beyond a tyrant's haughty beck,
    In quest of Eden, trod the rock-bound shore,
    Where bleak New England's wintry surges roar;
    Raleigh, with glory in his eagle eye,
    Chased the lost realm beneath a Southern sky;
    Whilst Boone believed that Paradise was found
    In old Kentucky's "dark and bloody ground!"In vain their labors, all in vain their toil;
    Doomed ne'er to breathe that air nor tread that soil.Heaven had reserved it till a race sublime
    Should launch its heroes on the wave of time!Go with me now, ye Californian band,
    And gaze with wonder at your glorious land;
    Ascend the summit of yon middle chain,
    When Mount Diablo rises from the plain,
    And cast your eyes with telescopic power,
    O'er hill and forest, over field and flower.how free the hand of God hath roll'd
    A wave of wealth across your Land of Gold!The mountains ooze it from their swelling breast,
    The milk-white quartz displays it in her crest;
    Each tiny brook that warbles to the sea,
    Harps on its strings a golden melody;
    Whilst the young waves are cradled on the shore
    On spangling pillows, stuffed with golden ore!See the Sacramento glide
    Through valleys blooming like a royal bride,
    And bearing onward to the ocean's shore
    A richer freight than Arno ever bore!also fanned by cool refreshing gales,
    Fair Petaluma and her sister vales,
    Whose fields and orchards ornament the plain
    And deluge earth with one vast sea of grain!Santa Clara smiles afar,
    As in the fields of heaven, a radiant star;
    Los Angeles is laughing through her vines;
    Old Monterey sits moody midst her pines;
    Far San Diego flames her golden bow,
    And Santa Barbara sheds her fleece of snow,
    Whilst Bernardino's ever-vernal down
    Gleams like an emerald in a monarch's crown!On the plains of San Joaquin
    Ten thousand herds in dense array are seen.Aloft like columns propping up the skies
    The cloud-kissed groves of Calaveras rise;
    Whilst dashing downward from their dizzy home
    The thundering falls of Yo Semite foam!Opening on an ocean great,
    Behold the portal of the Golden Gate!Pillared on granite, destined e'er to stand
    The iron rampart of the sunset land!With rosy cheeks, fanned by the fresh sea-breeze,
    The petted child of the Pacific seas,
    See San Francisco smile!Majestic heir
    Of all that's brave, or bountiful, or fair,
    Pride of our land, by every wave carest,
    And hailed by nations, Venice of the West!why should I tell,
    What every eye and bosom know so well?Why thy name the land all other lands have blest,
    And traced for ages to the distant West?Why search in vain throughout th' historic page
    For Eden's garden and the Golden Age?NO FURTHER LET US ROAM;
    THIS IS THE GARDEN![Decoration]

Printer Corrections and Notes:

p."THE TELESCOPIC EYE" changed
from p."THE EMERALD EYE from p.and "Secondly", to conform with remaining
recitations on succeeding page 202.

p.227, "The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?"Wherever the printer used a row of asterisks as a separator, the number
of asterisks used has been standardized to 5.Wherever the printer used blank space as a separator, a row of five
number signs (#) appears.And this fitness must be of two kinds: moral and intellectual.The candidate must "have come to years of discretion,"
i.e.he must "know to refuse the evil and choose the good".[7]  This
"age of discretion," or _competent age_, as the Catechism Rubric calls
it, is not a question of years, but of character.Our present Prayer
Book makes no allusion to any definite span of years whatever, and to
make the magic age of fifteen the minimum universal age for Candidates
is wholly illegal.At the Reformation, the English Church fixed seven
as the age for Confirmation, but our 1662 Prayer Book is more
primitive, and, taking a common-sense view, {102} leaves each case of
moral fitness to be decided on its own merits.The moral standard must
be an individual standard, and must be left, first, to the parent, who
presents the child to the Priest to be prepared; then, to the Priest
who prepares the child for Confirmation, and presents him to the
Bishop; and, lastly, to the Bishop, who must finally decide, upon the
combined testimony of the Priest and parent--and, if in doubt, upon his
own personal examination.The _intellectual_ standard is laid down in the Service for the "Public
Baptism of Infants": "So soon as he can say the Creed, the Lord's
Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, in the vulgar (i.e.his native)
tongue, and be further instructed, etc."Here, the words "can say"
obviously mean can say _intelligently_.The mere saying of the words
by rote is comparatively unimportant, though it has its use; but if
this were all, it would degrade the Candidate's intellectual status to
the capacities of a parrot.But, "as soon as" he can intelligently
comply with the Church's requirements, as soon as he has reached "a
competent age," any child may "be presented to the Bishop to be
confirmed by him".{103}

And, in the majority of cases, in these days, "the sooner, the better".It is, speaking generally, far safer to have the "child" prepared at
home--if it is a Christian home--and confirmed from home, than to risk
the preparation to the chance teaching of a Public School.With
splendid exceptions, School Confirmation is apt to get confused with
the school curriculum and school lessons.It is a sort of "extra
tuition," which, not infrequently, interferes with games or work,
without any compensating advantages in Church teaching.(IV) WHAT IS ESSENTIAL."The Laying on of Hands"--and nothing else.This act of ritual (so
familiar to the Early Church, from Christ's act in blessing little
children) was used by the Apostles,[8] and is still used by their
successors, the Bishops.It is the only act essential to a valid
Confirmation.Other, and suggestive, ceremonies have been in use in different ages,
and in different parts of the Church: but they are supplementary, not
essential.Thus, in the sub-apostolic age, ritual {104} acts expressed
very beautifully the early names for Confirmation, just as "the laying
on of Hands" still expresses the name which in the English Church
proclaims the essence of the Sacrament.For instance, Confirmation is called _The Anointing_,[9] and _The
Sealing_, and in some parts of the Church, the Priest dips his finger
in oil blessed by the Bishop, and signs or seals the child upon the
forehead with the sign of the Cross, thus symbolizing the meaning of
such names.But neither the sealing, nor the anointing, is necessary
for a valid Sacrament.Confirmation, then, "rightly and duly" administered, completes the
grace given to a child at the outset of its Christian career.It
admits the child to full membership and to full privileges in the
Christian Church.It is the ordained Channel by which the Bishop is
commissioned to convey and guarantee the special grace attached {105}
to, and only to, the Lesser Sacrament of Confirmation.[10]



[1] "Ratifying and _confirming_ the same in your own persons."[2] The word was "confess" in 1549.[3] The Greek Catechism of Plato, Metropolitan of Moscow, puts it very
clearly: "Through this holy Ordinance _the Holy Ghost descendeth upon
the person Baptized_, and confirmeth him in the grace which he received
in his Baptism according to the example of His descending upon the
disciples of Jesus Christ, and in imitation of the disciples
themselves, who after Baptism laid their hands upon the believers; by
which laying on of hands the Holy Ghost was conferred".[5] Minutes of Wesleyan Conference, 1889, p.[6] In the first ages, and, indeed, until the fifteenth century,
Confirmation followed immediately after Baptism, both in East and West,
as it still does in the East.[9] In an old seventh century Service, used in the Church of England
down to the Reformation, the Priest is directed: "Here he is to put the
Chrism (oil) on the forehead of the man, and say, 'Receive the sign of
the Holy Cross, by the Chrism of Salvation in Jesus Christ unto Eternal
Life.[10] The teaching of our Church of England, passing on the teaching of
the Church Universal, is very happily summed up in an ancient Homily of
the Church of England.It runs thus: "In Baptism the Christian was
born again spiritually, to live; in Confirmation he is made bold to
fight.There he received remission of sin; here he receiveth increase
of grace....  In Baptism he was chosen to be God's son; in Confirmation
God shall give him His Holy Spirit to... perfect him.In Baptism he
was called and chosen to be one of God's soldiers, and had his white
coat of innocency given him, and also his badge, which was the red
cross set upon his forehead...; in Confirmation he is encouraged to
fight, and to take the armour of God put upon him, which be able to
bear off the fiery darts of the devil."We have called Holy Matrimony the "_Sacrament of Perpetuation_," for it
is the ordained way in which the human race is to be perpetuated.Matrimony is the legal union between two persons,--a union which is
created by mutual consent: Holy Matrimony is that union sanctioned and
sanctified by the Church.There are three familiar names given to this union: Matrimony,
Marriage, Wedlock.Matrimony, derived from _mater_, a mother, tells of the woman's (i.e.wife-man's) "joy that a man is born into the world".Marriage, derived
from _maritus_, a husband (or house-dweller[1]), tells of the man's
place in the "hus" or house.Wedlock, derived from _weddian_, a
pledge, reminds both man and woman of the life-long pledge which each
has made "either to other".{107}

It is this Sacrament of Matrimony, Marriage, or Wedlock, that we are
now to consider.We will think of it under four headings:--

  (I) What is it for?Marriage is, as we have seen, God's method of propagating the human
race.It does this in two ways--by expansion, and by limitation.This
is seen in the New Testament ordinance, "one man for one woman".It
expands the race, but within due and disciplined limitations.Expansion, without limitation, would produce quantity without quality,
and would wreck the human race; limitation without expansion might
produce quality without quantity, but would extinguish the human race.Like every other gift of God, marriage is to be treated "soberly,
wisely, discretely," and, like every other gift, it must be used with a
due combination of freedom and restraint.Hence, among other reasons, the marriage union between one man and one
woman is {108} indissoluble.For marriage is not a mere union of
sentiment; it is not a mere terminable contract between two persons,
who have agreed to live together as long as they suit each other.It
is an _organic_ not an emotional union; "They twain shall be one
flesh," which nothing but death can divide.No law in Church or State
can unmarry the legally married.A State may _declare_ the
non-existence of the marriage union, just as it may _declare_ the
non-existence of God: but such a declaration does not affect the fact,
either in one case or the other.In England the State does, in certain cases, declare that the life-long
union is a temporary contract, and does permit "this man" or "this
woman" to live with another man, or with another woman, and, if they
choose, even to exchange husbands or wives.This is allowed by the
Divorce Act of 1857,[2] "when," writes Bishop Stubbs, "the calamitous
legislation of 1857 inflicted on English Society and English morals
{109} the most cruel blow that any conjunction of unrighteous influence
could possibly have contrived".[3]

The Church has made no such declaration.It rigidly forbids a husband
or wife to marry again during the lifetime of either party.The Law of
the Church remains the Law of the Church, overridden--but not repealed.This has led to a conflict between Church and State in a country where
they are, in theory though not in fact, united.But this is the fault
of the State, not of the Church.It is a case in which a junior
partner has acted without the consent of, or rather in direct
opposition to, the senior partner.Historically and chronologically
speaking, the Church (the senior partner) took the State (the junior
partner) into partnership, and the State, in spite of all the benefits
it has received from the Church, has taken all it could get, and has
thrown the Church over to legalize sin.It has ignored its senior
partner, and loosened the old historical bond between the two.This
the Church cannot help, and this the State fully admits, legally
absolving the Church from taking any part in its mock re-marriages.{110}

(II) WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE?The essence of matrimony is "mutual consent".The essential part of
the Sacrament consists in the words: "I, M., take thee, N.," etc.Nothing else is essential, though much else is desirable.Thus,
marriage in a church, however historical and desirable, is not
_essential_ to the validity of a marriage.Marriage at a Registry
Office (i.e.mutual consent in the presence of the Registrar) is every
bit as legally indissoluble as marriage in a church.The not uncommon
argument: "I was only married in a Registry Office, and can therefore
take advantage of the Divorce Act," is fallacious _ab initio_.[4]

Why, then, be married in, and by the Church?Apart from the history
and sentiment, for this reason.The Church is the ordained channel
through which grace to keep the marriage vow is bestowed.A special
and _guaranteed_ grace is {111} attached to a marriage sanctioned and
blest by the Church.The Church, in the name of God, "consecrates
matrimony," and from the earliest times has given its sanction and
blessing to the mutual consent.We are reminded of this in the
question: "Who _giveth_ this woman to be married to this man?"In
answer to the question, the Parent, or Guardian, presents the Bride to
the Priest (the Church's representative), who, in turn, presents her to
the Bridegroom, and blesses their union.In the Primitive Church,
notice of marriage had to be given to the Bishop of the Diocese, or his
representative,[5] in order that due inquiries might be made as to the
fitness of the persons, and the Church's sanction given or withheld.After this notice, a special service of _Betrothal_ (as well as the
actual marriage service) was solemnized.These two separate services are still marked off from each other in
(though both forming a part of) our present marriage service.The
first part of the service is held outside the chancel gates, and
corresponds to the old service of _Betrothal_.Here, too, the actual
ceremony of "mutual consent" now takes place--that part of {112} the
ceremony which would be equally valid in a Registry Office.Then
follows the second part of the service, in which the Church gives her
blessing upon the marriage.And because this part is, properly
speaking, part of the Eucharistic Office, the Bride and Bridegroom now
go to the Altar with the Priest, and there receive the Church's
Benediction, and--ideally--their first Communion after marriage.So
does the Church provide grace for her children that they may "perform
the vows they have made unto the King".The late hour for modern
weddings, and the consequent postponement[6] of Communion, has obscured
much of the meaning of the service; but a nine o'clock wedding, in
which the married couple receive the Holy Communion, followed by the
wedding breakfast, is, happily, becoming more common, and is restoring
to us one of the best of old English customs.It is easy enough to
slight old religious forms and ceremonies; but is anyone one atom
better, or happier for having neglected them?{113}

(III) WHOM IS IT FOR?Marriage is for three classes:--

(1) The unmarried--i.e.those who have never been married, or whose
marriage is (legally) dissolved by death.(2) The non-related--i.e.either by consanguinity (by blood), or
affinity (by marriage).But, is not this very
hard upon those whose marriage has been a mistake, and who have been
divorced by the State?And, above all, is it not very hard upon the
innocent party, who has been granted a divorce?It is very hard, so
hard, so terribly hard, that only those who have to deal personally,
and practically, with concrete cases, can guess how hard--hard enough
often on the guilty party, and harder still on the innocent."God
knows" it is hard, and will make it as easy as God Himself can make it,
if only self-surrender is placed before self-indulgence.We sometimes forget that legislation for
the individual may bear even harder {114} on the masses, than
legislation for the masses may bear upon the individual.And, after
all, this is not a question of "hard _versus_ easy," but of "right
_versus_ wrong".Moreover, as we are finding out, that which seems
easiest at the moment, often turns out hardest in the long run.It is
no longer contended that re-marriage after a State-divorce is that
universal Elysium which it has always been confidently assumed to be.There is, too, a positively absurd side to the present conflict between
Church and State.Some time ago, a young
girl married a man about whom she knew next to nothing, the man telling
her that marriage was only a temporary affair, and that, if it did not
answer, the State would divorce them.Wrong-doing
ensued, and a divorce was obtained.Then the girl entered into a
State-marriage with another man.A
divorce was again applied for, but this time was refused.Eventually,
the girl left her State-made husband, and ran away with her real
husband.In other words, she eloped with her own husband.But what is
her position to-day?In the eyes of the State, she is now living with
a man who is not {115} her husband.Her State-husband is still alive,
and can apply, at any moment, for an order for the restitution of
conjugal rights--however unlikely he is to get it.Further, if in the
future she has any children by her real husband (unless she has been
married again to him, after divorce from her State-husband) these
children will be illegitimate.This is the sort of muddle the Divorce
Act has got us into.One course, and only one course, is open to the
Church--to disentangle itself from all question of extending the powers
of the Act on grounds of inequality, or any other real (and sometimes
very real) or fancied hardship, and to consistently fight for the
repeal of the Act.This, it will be said, is _Utopian_.It
is the business of the Church to aim at the Utopian.Her whole history
shows that she is safest, as well as most successful, when aiming at
what the world derides.One question remains: Is not the present Divorce Law "one law for the
rich and another for the poor"?This is its sole
merit, if merit it can have.It does, at least, partially protect the
poor from sin-made-easy--a condition which money has bought for the
rich.If the State abrogated the Sixth {116} Commandment for the rich,
and made it lawful for a rich man to commit murder, it would at least
be no demerit if it refused to extend the permit to the poor.But, secondly, marriage is for the non-related--non-related, that is,
in two ways, by Consanguinity, and Affinity.(_a_) By _Consanguinity_.Consanguinity is of two kinds, lineal and
collateral._Lineal_ Consanguinity[7] is blood relationship "in a
_direct_ line," i.e._Collateral_
Consanguinity is blood relationship from a common ancestor, but not in
a direct line.The law of Consanguinity has not, at the present moment, been attacked,
and is still the law of the land.Affinity[8] is near relationship by marriage.It
is of three kinds: (1) _Direct_, i.e.between a husband and his wife's
blood relations, and between a wife and her husband's blood relations;
(2) _Secondary_, i.e.between a husband {117} and his wife's relations
by marriage; (3) _Collateral_, i.e.between a husband and the relations
of his wife's relations.In case of Affinity, the State has broken
faith with the Church without scruple, and the _Deceased Wife's Sister
Bill_[9] is the result.So has it

  brought confusion to the Table round.The question is sometimes asked, whether the State can alter the
Church's law without her consent.An affirmative answer would reduce
whatever union still remains between them to its lowest possible term,
and would place the Church in a position which no Nonconformist body
would tolerate for a day.The further question, as to whether the
State can order the Church to Communicate persons who have openly and
deliberately broken her laws, needs no discussion.No thinking person
seriously contends that it can.(3) _For the Full-Aged_.No boy under 14, and no girl under 12, can contract a legal marriage
either with, or without the consent of Parents or Guardians.No man
{118} or woman under 21 can do so against the consent of Parents or
Guardians.(IV) WHAT ARE ITS SAFEGUARDS?These are, mainly, two: _Banns_ and _Licences_--both intended to secure
the best safeguard of all, _publicity_.This publicity is secured,
first, by Banns.The word is the plural form of _Ban_, "a proclamation".The object of
this proclamation is to "ban" an improper marriage.In the case of marriage after Banns, in order to secure publicity:--

(1) Each party must reside[10] for twenty-one days in the parish where
the Banns are being published.(2) The marriage must be celebrated in one of the two parishes in which
the Banns have been published.{119}

(3) Seven days' previous notice of publication must be given to the
clergy by whom the Banns are to be published--though the clergy may
remit this length of notice if they choose.(4) The Banns must be published on three separate (though not
necessarily successive) Sundays.(5) Before the marriage, a certificate of publication must be presented
to the officiating clergyman, from the clergyman of the other parish in
which the Banns were published.(6) Banns only hold good for three months.After this period, they
must be again published three times before the marriage can take place.(7) Banns may be forbidden on four grounds: If either party is married
already; or is related by consanguinity or affinity; or is under age;
or is insane.(8) Banns published in false names invalidate a marriage, if both
parties are cognisant of the fact before the marriage takes place, i.e.if they wilfully intend to defeat the law, but not otherwise.There are two kinds of Marriage Licence, an Ordinary, or Common
Licence, and a Special Licence.{120}

An _Ordinary Licence_, costing about L2, is granted by the Bishop, or
Ordinary, in lieu of Banns, either through his Chancellor, or a
"Surrogate," i.e.In marriage by Licence, three points may
be noticed:--

(1) One (though only one) of the parties must reside in the parish
where the marriage is to be celebrated, for fifteen days previous to
the marriage.(2) One of the parties must apply for the Licence in person, not in
writing.(3) A licence only holds good for three months.A _Special Licence_, costing about L30, can only be obtained from the
Archbishop of Canterbury,[11] and is only granted after special and
minute inquiry.The points here to notice are:--

(1) Neither party need reside in the parish where the marriage is to be
solemnized.(2) The marriage may be celebrated in any Church, whether licensed or
unlicensed[12] for marriages.(3) It may be celebrated at any time of the day.It may be added that
if any clergyman {121} celebrates a marriage without either Banns or
Licence (or upon a Registrar's Certificate), he commits a felony, and
is liable to fourteen years' penal servitude.[13]

Other safeguards there are, such as:--

_The Time for Marriages_.--Marriages must not be celebrated before 8
A.M., or after 3 P.M., so as to provide a reasonable chance of
publicity._The Witnesses to a Marriage_.--Two witnesses, at least, must be
present, in addition to the officiating clergyman._The Marriage Registers_.--The officiating clergyman must enter the
marriage in two Registers provided by the State._The Signing of the Registers_.--The bride and bridegroom must sign
their names in the said Registers immediately after the ceremony, as
well as the two witnesses and the officiating clergyman.If either
party wilfully makes any false statement with regard to age, condition,
etc., he or she is guilty of perjury.Such are some of the wise safeguards provided by both Church and State
for the Sacrament of Marriage.Their object is to prevent the {122}
marriage state being entered into "lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly,"
to secure such publicity as will prevent clandestine marriages,[14] and
will give parents, and others with legal status, an opportunity to
lodge legal objections.Great is the solemnity of the Sacrament in which is "signified and
represented the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and His Church".[1] Husband--from _hus_, a house, and _buan_, to dwell.[2] Until fifty-three years ago an Act of Parliament was necessary for
a divorce.In 1857 _The Matrimonial Causes Act_ established the
Divorce Court.In 1873 the _Indicature Act_ transferred it to a
division of the High Court--the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
Division.[3] "Visitation Charges," p.[4] It is a common legal error that seven years effective separation
between husband and wife entitles either to remarry, and hundreds of
women who have lost sight of their husbands for seven years innocently
commit bigamy.Probably the mistake comes from the fact that
_prosecution_ for bigamy does not hold good in such a case.But this
does not legalize the bigamous marriage or legitimize the children.[5] The origin of Banns.[6] The Rubric says: "It is convenient that the new-married persons
receive the Holy Communion _at the time of their marriage_, or at the
first opportunity after their marriage," thus retaining, though
releasing, the old rule.[7] Consanguinity--from _cum_, together, and _sanguineus_, relating to
blood.[8] Affinity--from _ad_, near, and _finis_, a boundary.[9] See a most helpful paper read by Father Puller at the E.C.U.Anniversary Meeting, and reported in "The Church Times" of 17 June,
1910.[10] There seems to be no legal definition of the word "reside".The
law would probably require more than leaving a bag in a room, hired for
twenty-one days, as is often done.It must be remembered that the
object of the law is _publicity_--that is, the avoidance of a
clandestine marriage, which marriage at a Registry Office now
frequently makes so fatally easy.[12] Such as, for example, Royal Chapels, St.Paul's Cathedral, Eton
College Chapel, etc.[14] It will be remembered that runaway marriages were, in former days,
frequently celebrated at Gretna Green, a Scotch village in
Dumfriesshire, near the English border.{123}

CHAPTER X.

HOLY ORDER.The Second Sacrament of Perpetuation is Holy Order.As the Sacrament
of Marriage perpetuates the human race, so the Sacrament of Order
perpetuates the Priesthood.Holy Order, indeed, perpetuates the
Sacraments themselves.It is the ordained channel through which the
Sacramental life of the Church is continued.Holy Order, then, was instituted for the perpetuation of those
Sacraments which depend upon Apostolic Succession.It makes it
possible for the Christian laity to be Confirmed, Communicated,
Absolved.Thus, the Christian Ministry is a great deal more than a
body of men, chosen as officers might be chosen in the army or navy.It is the Church's media for the administration of the Sacraments of
Salvation.To say this does not assert that God cannot, and does not,
save and sanctify souls in any other way; but it does assert, as
Scripture does, that the {124} Christian Ministry is the authorized and
ordained way.In this Ministry, there are three orders, or degrees: Bishops, Priests,
and Deacons.In the words of the Prayer Book: "It is evident unto all
men, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that, from
the Apostles' time, there have been these Orders of Ministers in
Christ's Church; Bishops, Priests, and Deacons".[1]



(I) BISHOPS.Jesus Christ, "the Shepherd and Bishop of
our souls".When, and where, was the first Ordination?In the Upper
Chamber, when He, the Universal Bishop, Himself ordained the first
Apostles.When was {125} the second Ordination?When these Apostles
ordained Matthias to succeed Judas.This was the first link in the
chain of Apostolic Succession.In apostolic days,
Timothy was ordained, with episcopal jurisdiction over Ephesus; Titus,
over Crete; Polycarp (the friend of St.John), over Smyrna; and then,
later on, Linus, over Rome.And so the great College of Bishops
expands until, in the second century, we read in a well-known writer,
St.Irenaeus: "We can reckon up lists of Bishops ordained in the
Churches from the Apostles to our time".Link after link, the chain of
succession lengthens "throughout all the world," until it reaches the
Early British Church, and then, in 597, the English Church, through the
consecration of Augustine,[2] first Archbishop of Canterbury, and in
1903 of Randall Davidson his ninety-fourth successor.And this is the history of every ordination in the Church to-day."It
is through the Apostolic Succession," said the late Bishop Stubbs to
his ordination Candidates, "that I am empowered, through the long line
of mission and Commission {126} from the Upper Chamber at Jerusalem, to
lay my hands upon you and send you."[3]

How does a Priest become a Bishop?In the Church of England he goes
through four stages:--

  (1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop.(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.(1) He is _nominated_ by the Crown.This is in accordance with the
immemorial custom of this realm.In these days, the Prime Minister
(representing the people) proposes the name of a Priest to the King,
who accepts or rejects the recommendation.If he accepts it, the King
nominates the selected Priest to the Church for election, and
authorizes the issue of legal documents for such election.This is
called _Conge d'elire_, "leave to elect".(2) He is _elected_ by the Church.The King's {127} nominee now comes
before the Dean and Chapter (representing the Church), and the Church
either elects or rejects him.If the
nominee is elected, what is called his "Confirmation" follows--that
is:--

(3) His election is _confirmed_ by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
according to a right reserved to him by _Magna Charta_.Before
confirming the election, the Archbishop, or his representative, sits in
public, generally at Bow Church, Cheapside, to hear legal objections
from qualified laity against the election.Objections were of late, it
will be remembered, made, and overruled, in the cases of Dr.Then, if duly nominated, elected, and confirmed,--

(4) He is _consecrated_ by the Episcopate.To safeguard the
Succession, three Bishops, at least, are required for the Consecration
of another Bishop, though one would secure a valid Consecration.No
Priest can be Consecrated Bishop under the age of thirty.Very
carefully does the Church safeguard admission to the Episcopate.{128}

_Homage._

After Consecration, the Bishop "does homage,"[4] i.e.he says that he,
like any other subject (ecclesiastic or layman), is the King's
"_homo_".He does homage, not for any
spiritual gift, but for "all the possessions, and profette spirituall
and temporall belongyng to the said...[5]  The
_temporal_ possessions include such things as his house, revenue, etc.But what is meant by doing homage for _spiritual_ possessions?Does
not this admit the claim that the King can, as Queen Elizabeth is
reported to have said, make or unmake a Bishop?Spiritual
_possessions_ do not here mean spiritual _powers_,--powers which can be
conferred by the Episcopate alone.{129} The "spiritual possessions"
for which a Bishop "does homage" refer to fees connected with spiritual
things, such as Episcopal Licences, Institutions to Benefices, Trials
in the Ecclesiastical Court, Visitations--fees, by the way, which, with
very rare exceptions, do not go into the Bishop's own pocket!_Jurisdiction._

What is meant by Episcopal Jurisdiction?Jurisdiction is of two kinds,
_Habitual_ and _Actual_.Habitual Jurisdiction is the Jurisdiction given to a Bishop to exercise
his office in the Church at large.It is conveyed with Consecration,
and is given to the Bishop as a Bishop of the Catholic Church.Thus an
Episcopal act, duly performed, would be valid, however irregular,
outside the Bishop's own Diocese, and in any part of the Church._Actual Jurisdiction_ is this universal Jurisdiction limited to a
particular area, called a Diocese.To this area, a Bishop's right to
exercise his Habitual Jurisdiction is, for purposes of order and
business, confined.The next order in the Ministry is the Priesthood.{130}

(II) PRIESTS.No one can read the Prayer-Book Office for the _Ordering of Priests_
without being struck by its contrast to the ordinary conception of
Priesthood by the average Englishman.The Bishop's words in the
Ordination Service: "Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of
a Priest in the Church of God," must surely mean more than that a
Priest should try to be a good organizer, a good financier, a good
preacher, or good at games--though the better he is at all these, the
better it may be.But the gift of the Holy Ghost for "the Office and
Work of a Priest" must mean more than this.We may consider it in connexion with four familiar English clerical
titles: _Priest, Minister, Parson, Clergyman_._Priest._

According to the Prayer Book, a Priest, or Presbyter, is ordained to do
three things, which he, and he alone, can do: to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless.He, and he alone, can _Absolve_.It is the day of his
Ordination to the Priesthood.He is saying Matins as a Deacon just
_before_ his {131} Ordination, and he is forbidden to pronounce the
Absolution: he is saying Evensong just _after_ his Ordination, and he
is ordered to pronounce the Absolution.He, and he alone, can _Consecrate_.If a Deacon pretends to Consecrate
the Elements at the Blessed Sacrament, not only is his act sacrilege
and invalid, but even by the law of the land he is liable to a penalty
of L100.[6]

He, and he alone, can give the _Blessing_--i.e.The right of Benediction belongs to him as part of his
Ministerial Office.The Blessing pronounced by a Deacon might be the
personal blessing of a good and holy man, just as the blessing of a
layman--a father blessing his child--might be of value as such.In
each case it would be a personal act.But a Priest does not bless in
his own name, but in the name of the Whole Church.It is an official,
not a personal act: he conveys, not his own, but the Church's blessing
to the people.Hence, the valid Ordination of a Priest is of essential importance to
the laity.{132}

But there is another aspect of "the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God".This we see in the word



_Minister._

The Priest not only ministers before God on behalf of his people, but
he ministers to his people on behalf of God.In this aspect of the
Priesthood, he ministers God's gifts to the laity.If, as a Priest, he
pleads the One Sacrifice on behalf of the people, as a Minister he
feeds the people upon the one Sacrifice.His chief ministerial duty is
to minister to the people--to give them Baptism, Absolution, Holy
Communion; to minister to all their spiritual needs whenever, and
wherever, he is needed.It is, surely, a sad necessity that this ministerial "office and work"
should be so often confused with finance, doles, charities, begging
sermons, committees, etc.In all such things he is, indeed, truly
serving and ministering; but he is often obliged to place them in the
wrong order of importance, and so dim the sight of the laity to his
real position, and not infrequently make his spiritual ministrations
unacceptable.A well-known and London-wide respected Priest said {133}
shortly before he died, that he had almost scattered his congregation
by the constant "begging sermons" which he hated, but which necessity
made imperative.The laity are claiming (and rightly claiming) the
privilege of being Church workers, and are preaching (and rightly
preaching) that "the Clergy are not the Church".If only they would
practise what they preach, and relieve the Clergy of all Church
finance, they need never listen to another "begging sermon" again.So
doing, they would rejoice the heart of the Clergy, and fulfil one of
their true functions as laity.This is one of the most beautiful of all the clerical names, only it
has become smirched by common use.The word Parson is derived from _Persona_, a _person_.The Parson is
_the_ Person--the Person who represents God in the Parish.It is not
his own person, or position, that he stands for, but the position and
Person of his Master.Paul, he can say, "I magnify mine
office," and probably the best way to magnify his office will be to
minimize himself.The outward marks of {134} respect still shown to
"the Parson" in some places, are not necessarily shown to the person
himself (though often, thank God, they may be), but are meant, however
unconsciously, to honour the Person he represents--just as the lifting
of the hat to a woman is not, of necessity, a mark of respect to the
individual woman, but a tribute to the Womanhood she represents.The Parson, then, is, or should be, the official person, the standing
element in the parish, who reminds men of God._Clergyman._

The word is derived from the Greek _kleros_,[7] "a lot," and conveys
its own meaning.According to some, it takes us back in thought to the
first Apostolic Ordination, when "they cast _lots_, and the _lot_ fell
upon Matthias".It reminds us that, as Matthias "was numbered with the
eleven," so a "Clergyman" is, at his Ordination, numbered with that
long list of "Clergy" who trace their spiritual pedigree to Apostolic
days.{135}

_Ordination Safeguards._

"Seeing then," run the words of the Ordination Service, "into how high
a dignity, and how weighty an Office and Charge" a Priest is called,
certain safeguards surround his Ordination, both for his own sake, and
for the sake of his people._Age._

No Deacon can, save under very exceptional circumstances, be ordained
Priest before he is 24, and has served at least a year in the Diaconate._Fitness._

This fitness, as in Confirmation, will be intellectual and moral.His
_intellectual_ fitness is tested by the Bishop's Examining Chaplain
some time before the Ordination to the Priesthood, and, in doubtful
cases, by the Bishop himself.His _moral_ fitness is tested by the Publication during Service, in the
Church where he is Deacon, of his intention to offer himself as a
Candidate for the Priesthood.To certify that this has been done, this
Publication must be signed by the Churchwarden, representing the {136}
laity, and by the Incumbent, representing the Clergy and responsible to
the Bishop.Further safeguard is secured by letters of Testimony from three
Beneficed Clergy, who have known the Candidate well either for the past
three years, or during the term of his Diaconate.Finally, at the very last moment, in the Ordination Service itself, the
Bishop invites the laity, if they know "any impediment or notable
crime" disqualifying the Candidate from being ordained Priest, to "come
forth in the Name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is".For many obvious reasons, but specially for
one._The Indelibility of Orders._

Once a Priest, always a Priest.When once the Bishop has ordained a
Deacon to the Priesthood, there is no going back.The law,
ecclesiastical or civil, may deprive him of the right to _exercise_ his
Office, but no power can deprive him of the Office itself.For instance, to safeguard the Church, and for {137} the sake of the
laity, a Priest may, for various offences, be what is commonly called
"unfrocked".He may be degraded, temporarily suspended, or permanently
forbidden to _officiate_ in any part of the Church; but he does not
cease to be a Priest.Any Priestly act, rightly and duly performed,
would be valid, though irregular.It would be for the people's good,
though it would be to his own hurt.Again: by _The Clerical Disabilities Act_ of 1870, a Priest may, by the
law of the land, execute a "Deed of Relinquishment," and, as far as the
law is concerned, return to lay life.This would enable him legally to
undertake lay work which the law forbids to the Clergy.[8]

He may, in consequence, regain his legal rights as a layman, and lose
his legal rights as a Priest; but he does not cease to be a Priest.The law can only touch his civil status, and cannot touch his priestly
"character".Hence, no securities can be superfluous to safeguard the irrevocable.{138}

_Jurisdiction._

As in the case of the Bishops, a Priest's jurisdiction is
twofold--_habitual_ and _actual_.Ordination confers on him _habitual_
jurisdiction, i.e.the power to exercise his office, to Absolve, to
Consecrate, to Bless, in the "Holy Church throughout the world".And,
as in the case of Bishops, for purposes of ecclesiastical order and
discipline, this Habitual Jurisdiction is limited to the sphere in
which the Bishop licenses him."Take thou authority," says the Bishop,
"to preach the word of God, and to minister the Sacraments _in the
congregation where thou shalt be lawfully appointed thereunto_."This
is called _Actual_ Jurisdiction._The Essence of the Sacrament._

The absolutely essential part of Ordination is the Laying on of Hands
(1 Tim.Various other and beautiful
ceremonies have, at different times, and in different places,
accompanied the essential Rite.Sometimes, and in some parts of the
Church, Unction, or anointing the Candidate with oil, has been used:
sometimes Ordination has been accompanied with the delivery of a Ring,
the Paten {139} and Chalice, the Bible, or the Gospels, the Pastoral
Staff (to a Bishop),--all edifying ceremonies, but not essentials.The word comes from the Greek _diakonos_, a
servant, and exactly describes the Office.Originally, a permanent
Order in the Church, the Diaconate is now, in the Church of England,
generally regarded as a step to the Priesthood.But
it is as this step, or preparatory stage, that we have to consider it.Considering the importance of this first step in the Ministry, both to
the man himself, and to the people, it is well that the laity should
know what safeguards are taken by the Bishop to secure "fit persons to
serve in the sacred ministry of the Church"[9]--and should realize
their own great responsibility in the matter.(1) _The Age._

No layman can be made a Deacon under 23.{140}

(2) The Preliminaries.The chief preliminary is the selection of the Candidate.The burden of
selection is shared by the Bishop, Clergy and Laity.The Bishop must,
of course, be the final judge of the Candidate's fitness, but _the
evidence upon which he bases his judgment_ must very largely be
supplied by the Laity.We pray in the Ember Collect that he "may lay hands suddenly on no man,
but make choice of _fit persons_".It is well that the Laity should
remember that they share with the Bishop and Clergy in the
responsibility of choice.For this fitness will, as in the case of the Priest, be moral and
intellectual.It will be _moral_--and it is here that the responsibility of the laity
begins.For, in addition to private inquiries made by the Bishop, the
laity are publicly asked, in the church of the parish where the
Candidate resides, to bear testimony to the integrity of his character.This publication is called the _Si quis_, from the Latin of the first
two words of publication ("if any..."), and it is repeated by the
Bishop in open church in the Ordination Service.The {141} absence of
any legal objection by the laity is the testimony of the people to the
Candidate's fitness.This throws upon the laity a full share of
responsibility in the choice of the Candidate.Their responsibility in
giving evidence is only second to that of the Bishop, whose decision
rests upon the evidence they give.Then, there is the testimony of the Clergy.No layman is accepted by
the Bishop for Ordination without _Letters Testimonial_--i.e.the
testimony of three beneficed Clergymen, to whom he is well known.These Clergy must certify that "we have had opportunity of observing
his conduct, and we do believe him, in our consciences, and as to his
moral conduct, a fit person to be admitted to the Sacred Ministry".Each signature must be countersigned by the signatory's own Bishop, who
thus guarantees the Clergyman's moral fitness to certify.Lastly, comes the Bishop himself, who, from first to last, is in close
touch with the Candidate, and who almost invariably helps to prepare
him personally in his own house during the week before his Ordination.In addition to University testimony,
evidence of the Candidate's {142} intellectual fitness is given to the
Bishop, as in the case of Priests, by his Examining Chaplains.Some
months before the Ordination, the Candidate is examined, and the
Examiner's Report sent in to the Bishop.The standard of intellectual
fitness has differed at various ages, in different parts of the Church,
and no one standard can be laid down.Assuming that the average
proportion of people in a parish will be (on a generous calculation) as
twelve Jurymen to one Judge, the layman called to the Diaconate should,
at least, be equal in intellectual attainment to "the layman" called to
the Bar.It does sometimes happen that evidence is given by Clergy, or laity,
which leads the Bishop to reject the Candidate on moral grounds.It
does sometimes happen that the Candidate is rejected or postponed on
intellectual grounds.It does, it must, sometimes happen that mistakes
are made: God alone is infallible.But, if due care is taken, publicly
and privately, and if the laity, as well as the Clergy, do their duty,
the Bishop's risk of a wrong judgment is reduced to a very small
minimum.A "fit" Clergy is so much the concern of the laity, that they may well
be reminded of their {143} parts and duties in the Ordination of a
Deacon.Liddon says, "the strength of the Church does not
consist in the number of pages in its 'Clerical Directory,' but in the
sum total of the moral and spiritual force which she has at her
command".[1] "The Threefold Ministry," writes Bishop Lightfoot, "can be traced
to Apostolic direction; and, short of an express statement, we can
possess no better assurance of a Divine appointment, or, at least, a
Divine Sanction."And he adds, speaking of his hearty desire for union
with the Dissenters, "we cannot surrender for any immediate advantages
the threefold Ministry which we have inherited from Apostolic times,
and which is the historic backbone of the Church" ("Ep.[2] The Welsh Bishops did not transmit Episcopacy to us, but rather
came into us.[3] In a book called _Registrum Sacrum Anglicanum_, Bishop Stubbs has
traced the name, date of Consecration, names of Consecrators, and in
most cases place of Consecration, of every Bishop in the Church of
England from the Consecration of Augustine.[4] The Bishops are one of the three Estates of the Realm--Lords
Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Commons (not, as is so often said, King,
Lords, and Commons).The Archbishop of Canterbury is the first Peer of
the Realm, and has precedency immediately after the blood royal.The
Archbishop of York has precedency over all Dukes, not being of royal
blood, and over all the great officers of State, except the Lord
Chancellor.He has the privilege of crowning the Queen Consort."Encyclopedia of the Laws of England," vol.See Phillimore's "Ecclesiastical Law,"
vol.[7] But see Skeat, whose references are to [Greek: kleros], "a lot," in
late Greek, and the Clergy whose portion is the Lord (Deut.The [Greek: kleros] is thus the portion
rather than the circumstance by which it is obtained, i.e.[8] For example: farming more than a certain number of acres, or going
into Parliament.We deal now with the two last Sacraments under consideration--Penance
and Unction.Penance is for the
healing of the soul, and indirectly of the body: Unction is for the
healing of the body, and indirectly of the soul.Thomas Aquinas, "has been instituted to
produce one special effect, although it may produce, as consequences,
other effects besides."It is so with these two Sacraments.Body and
Soul are so involved, that what directly affects the one must
indirectly affect the other.Thus, the direct effect of Penance on the
soul must indirectly affect the body, and the direct effect of Unction
on the body must indirectly affect the soul.{145}

_Penance._

The word is derived from the Latin _penitentia_, penitence, and its
root-meaning (_poena_, punishment) suggests a punitive element in all
real repentance.It is used as a comprehensive term for confession of
sin, punishment for sin, and the Absolution, or Remission of Sins.As
Baptism was designed to recover the soul from original or inherited
sin, so Penance was designed to recover the soul from actual or wilful
sin....[1]  It is not, as in the case of infant Baptism, administered
wholly irrespective of free will: it must be freely sought ("if he
humbly and heartily desire it"[2]) before it can be freely bestowed.Thus, Confession must precede Absolution, and Penitence must precede
and accompany Confession._Confession._

Here we all start on common ground.the necessity of Confession (1) _to God_ ("If we confess our sins, He
is faithful and just to forgive us our sins") {146} and (2) _to man_
("Confess your faults one to another").Further, we all agree that
confession to man is in reality confession to God ("Against Thee, _Thee
only_, have I sinned").Our only ground of difference is, not
_whether_ we ought to confess, but _how_ we ought to confess.It is a
difference of method rather than of principle.There are two ways of confessing sins (whether to God, or to man), the
informal, and the formal.Most of us use one way; some the other; many
both._Informal Confession_.--Thank God, I can use this way at any, and at
every, moment of my life.If I have sinned, I need wait for no formal
act of Confession; but, as I am, and where I am, I can make my
Confession.Then, and there, I can claim the Divine response to the
soul's three-fold _Kyrie_: "Lord, have mercy upon me; Christ, have
mercy upon me; Lord, have mercy upon me".But do I never want--does
God never want--anything more than this?The soul is not always
satisfied with such an easy method of going to Confession.It needs at
times something more impressive, something perhaps less superficial,
less easy going.It demands more time for {147} deepening thought, and
greater knowledge of what it has done, before sin's deadly hurt cuts
deep enough to produce real repentance, and to prevent repetition.At
such times, it cries for something more formal, more solemn, than
instantaneous confession.It needs, what the Prayer Book calls, "a
special Confession of sins"._Formal Confession_.--Hence our Prayer Book provides two formal Acts of
Confession, and suggests a third.Two of these are for public use, the
third for private.In Matins and Evensong, and in the Eucharistic Office, a form of
"_general_ confession" is provided.Both forms are in the first person
plural throughout.Clearly, their primary intention is, not to make us
merely think of, or confess, our own personal sins, but the sins of the
Church,--and our own sins, as members of the Church.It is "we" have
sinned, rather than "I" have sinned.Such formal language might,
otherwise, at times be distressingly unreal,--when, e.g., not honestly
feeling that the "burden" of our own personal sin "is intolerable," or
when making a public Confession in church directly after a personal
Confession in private.In the Visitation of the Sick, the third mode of {148} formal
Confession is suggested, though the actual words are naturally left to
the individual penitent.The Prayer Book no longer speaks in the
plural, or of "a _general_ Confession," but it closes, as it were, with
the soul, and gets into private, personal touch with it: "Here shall
the sick man be moved to make a _special_ Confession of his sins, if he
feel his conscience troubled with any weighty matter; after which
Confession, the Priest shall absolve him (if he humbly and heartily
desire it) after this sort".This Confession is to be both free and
formal: formal, for it is to be made before the Priest in his
"_ministerial_" capacity; free, for the penitent is to be "moved" (not
"compelled") to confess.Notice, he _is_ to be moved; but then (though
not till then) he is free to accept, or reject, the preferred means of
grace.Sacraments are open to all;
they are forced on none.They are love-tokens of the Sacred Heart;
free-will offerings of His Royal Bounty.These, then, are the two methods of Confession at our disposal.God is
"the Father of an infinite Majesty".In _informal_ Confession, the
sinner goes to God as his _Father_,--as the Prodigal, after doing
penance in the far country, went {149} to his father with "_Father_, I
have sinned".In _formal_ Confession, the sinner goes to God as to the
Father of an _infinite Majesty_,--as David went to God through Nathan,
God's ambassador.It is a fearful responsibility to hinder any soul from using either
method; it is a daring risk to say: "Because one method alone appeals
to me, therefore no other method shall be used by you".God multiplies
His methods, as He expands His love: and if any "David" is drawn to say
"I have sinned" before the appointed "Nathan," and, through prejudice
or ignorance, such an one is hindered from so laying his sins on Jesus,
God will require that soul at the hinderer's hands._Absolution._

It is the same with Absolution as with Confession.Here, too, we start
on common ground.All agree that "_God only_ can forgive sins," and
half our differences come because this is not recognized.Whatever
form Confession takes, the penitent exclaims: "_To Thee only it
appertaineth to forgive sins_".Pardon through the Precious Blood is
the one, and only, source of {150} forgiveness.Our only difference,
then, is as to God's _methods_ of forgiveness.Some seem to limit His love, to tie forgiveness down to one, and
only one, method of absolution--direct, personal, instantaneous,
without any ordained Channel such as Christ left.Direct, God's pardon
certainly is; personal and instantaneous, it certainly can be; without
any sacramental _media_, it certainly may be.But we dare not limit
what God has not limited; we dare not deny the existence of ordained
channels, because God can, and does, act without such channels.He has
opened an ordained fountain for sin and uncleanness as a superadded
gift of love, and in the Ministry of reconciliation He conveys pardon
through this channel.At the most solemn moment of his life, when a Deacon is ordained
Priest, the formal terms of his Commission to the Priesthood run thus:
"Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Imposition of our hands.Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou
dost retain, they are retained."No
Priest dare hide his commission, play with {151} the plain meaning of
the words, or conceal from others a "means of grace" which they have a
blessed right to know of, and to use.But what is the good of this Absolution, if God can forgive without it?There must, therefore, be some
superadded grace attached to this particular ordinance.It is not left merely to comfort the penitent (though that it
does), nor to let him hear from a fellow-sinner that his sins are
forgiven him (though that he does); but it is left, like any other
Sacrament, as a special means of grace.It is the ordained Channel
whereby God's pardon is conveyed to (and only to) the penitent sinner."No penitence, no pardon," is the law of Sacramental Absolution.The Prayer Book, therefore, preaches the power of formal, as well as
informal, Absolution.There are in it three forms of Absolution,
varying in words but the same in power.The appropriating power of the
penitent may, and does, vary, according to the sincerity of his
confession: Absolution is in each case the same.It is man's capacity
to receive it, not God's power in giving it, that varies.Thus, all
three Absolutions in the {152} Prayer Book are of the same force,
though our appropriating capacity in receiving them may differ.This
capacity will probably be less marked at Matins and Evensong than at
Holy Communion, and at Holy Communion than in private Confession,
because it will be less personal, less thorough.The words of
Absolution seem to suggest this.The first two forms are in the plural
("pardon and deliver _you_"), and are thrown, as it were, broadcast
over the Church: the third is special ("forgive _thee_ thine offences")
and is administered to the individual.But the formal act is the same
in each case; and to stroll late into church, as if the Absolution in
Matins and Evensong does not matter, may be to incur a very distinct
loss.When, and how often, formal "special Confession" is to be used, and
formal Absolution to be sought, is left to each soul to decide.The
two special occasions which the Church of England emphasizes (without
limiting) are before receiving the Holy Communion, and when sick.Before Communion, the Prayer Book counsels its use for any disquieted
conscience; and the {153} Rubric which directs intending Communicants
to send in their names to the Parish Priest the day before making their
Communion, still bears witness to its framers' intention--that known
sinners might not be communicated without first being brought to a
state of repentance.The sick, also, after being directed to make their wills,[3] and
arrange their temporal affairs, are further urged to examine their
spiritual state; to make a special confession; and to obtain the
special grace, in the special way provided for them.And, adds the
Rubric, "men should often be put in remembrance to take order for the
settling of their temporal estates, while they are in health"--and if
of the temporal, how much more of their spiritual estate._Direction._

But, say some, is not all this very weakening to the soul?They are,
probably, mixing up two things,--the Divine Sacrament of forgiveness
which (rightly used) must be strengthening, and the human appeal for
direction which (wrongly used) may be weakening.{154}

But "direction" is not necessarily part of Penance.The Prayer Book
lays great stress upon it, and calls it "ghostly counsel and advice,"
but it is neither Confession nor Absolution.It has its own place in
the Prayer Book;[4] but it has not, necessarily, anything whatever to
do with the administration of the Sacrament.Direction may, or may
not, be good for the soul.It largely depends upon the character of
the penitent, and the wisdom of the Director.It is quite possible for
the priest to over-direct, and it is fatally possible for the penitent
to think more of direction than of Absolution.It is quite possible to
obscure the Sacramental side of Penance with a human craving for
"ghostly counsel and advice".Satan would not be Satan if it were not
so.But this "ghostly," or spiritual, "counsel and advice" has saved
many a lad, and many a man, from many a fall; and when rightly sought,
and wisely given is, as the Prayer Book teaches, a most helpful adjunct
to Absolution.Only, it is not, necessarily, a part of "going to
Confession".{155}

_Indulgences._

The abuse of the Sacrament is another, and not unnatural objection to
its use; and it often gets mixed up with Mediaeval teaching about
Indulgences.An _Indulgence_ is exactly what the word suggests--the act of
indulging, or granting a favour.In Roman theology, an Indulgence is
the remission of temporal punishment due to sin after Absolution.It
is either "plenary," i.e.when the whole punishment is remitted, or
"partial," when some of it is remitted.At corrupt periods of Church
history, these Indulgences have been bought for money,[5] thus making
one law for the rich, and another for the poor.Very naturally, the
scandals connected with such buying and selling raised suspicions
against the Sacrament with which Indulgences were associated.[6]  But
Indulgences have nothing in the world to do with the right use of the
lesser Sacrament of Penance.{156}

_Amendment._

The promise of Amendment is an essential part of Penance.It is a
necessary element in all true contrition.Thus, the penitent promises
"true amendment" before he receives Absolution.If he allowed a priest
to give him Absolution without firmly purposing to amend, he would not
only invalidate the Absolution, but would commit an additional sin.The promise to amend may, like any other promise, be made and broken;
but the deliberate purpose must be there.No better description of true repentance can be found than in
Tennyson's "Guinevere":--

  _For what is true repentance but in thought--_
  _Not ev'n in inmost thought to think again_
  _The sins that made the past so pleasant to us._


Such has been the teaching of the Catholic Church always, everywhere,
and at all times: such is the teaching of the Church of England, as
part of that Church, and as authoritatively laid down in the Book of
Common Prayer.Absolution is the conveyance of God's
pardon to the penitent sinner by God's ordained Minister, through the
ordained Ministry of Reconciliation.{157}

  Lamb of God, the world's transgression
    Thou alone canst take away;
  Hear!hear our heart's confession,
    And Thy pardoning grace convey.Thine availing intercession
    We but echo when we pray.[2] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[3] Rubric in the Order for the Visitation of the Sick.[4] See the First Exhortation in the Order of the Administration of the
Holy Communion.Peter's at Rome was largely built out of funds gained by the
sale of indulgences.[6] The Council of Trent orders that Indulgences must be granted by
Pope and Prelate _gratis_.The second Sacrament of Recovery is _Unction_, or, in more familiar
language, "the Anointing of the Sick".It is called by Origen "the
complement of Penance".The meaning of the Sacrament is found in St.let him call for the elders of the Church; and let them
pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;
and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."Here the Bible states that the "Prayer of Faith" with Unction is more
effective than the "Prayer of Faith" without Unction.It can (1) recover the body, and (2) restore the
soul.Its primary {159} object seems to be to recover the body; but it
also, according to the teaching of St.First, he says, Anointing with the Prayer of Faith heals the body; and
then, because of the inseparable union between body and soul, it
cleanses the soul.Thus, as the object of Penance is primarily to heal the soul, and
indirectly to heal the body; so the object of Unction is primarily to
heal the body, and indirectly to heal the soul.The story of Unction may be summarized very shortly.It was instituted
in Apostolic days, when the Apostles "anointed with oil many that were
sick and healed them" (St.It was continued in the Early
Church, and perpetuated during the Middle Ages, when its use (by a
"_corrupt_[1] following of the Apostles") was practically limited to
the preparation of the dying instead of (by a _correct_ "following of
the Apostles") being used for the recovery of the living.In our 1549
Prayer Book an authorized Office was appointed for its use, but this,
lest it should be misused, was omitted in 1552.And although, as
Bishop Forbes says, "everything of that earlier Liturgy was praised by
those who {160} removed it," it has not yet been restored.It is "one
of the lost Pleiads" of our present Prayer Book.But, as Bishop Forbes
adds, "there is nothing to hinder the revival of the Apostolic and
Scriptural Custom of Anointing the Sick whenever any devout person
desires it".[2]



_Extreme Unction._

An unhistoric use of the name partly explains the unhistoric use of the
Sacrament._Extreme_, or last (_extrema_) Unction has been taken to
mean the anointing of the sick when _in extremis_.This, as we have
seen, is a "corrupt," and not a correct, "following of the Apostles".The phrase _Extreme_ Unction means the extreme, or last, of a series of
ritual Unctions, or anointings, once used in the Church.The first
Unction was in Holy Baptism, when the Baptized were anointed with Holy
Oil: then came the anointing in Confirmation: then in Ordination; and,
last of all, the anointing of the sick.Of this last anointing, it is
written: "All Christian men should account, and repute the said manner
of anointing among the other Sacraments, forasmuch as it is a visible
sign of an invisible grace".[3]

{161}

_Its Administration._

It must be administered under the Scriptural conditions laid down in
St.The first condition refers to:--

(1) _The Minister_.--The Minister is _the Church_, in her corporate
capacity.Scripture says to the sick: "Let him call for the Elders,"
or Presbyters, "of the Church".The word is in the plural; it is to be
the united act of the whole Church.And, further, there must be
nothing secret about it, as if it were either a charm, or something to
be ashamed of, or apologized for.It may have to be done in a private
house, but it is to be done by no private person.[4]  "Let him call for
the elders."(2) _The Manner_.--The Elders are to administer Sacrament not in their
own name (any more than the Priest gives Absolution in his own name),
but "in the Name of the Lord".(3) _The Method_.--The sick man is to be anointed (either on the
afflicted part, or in other ways), _with prayer_: "Let them pray over
him".{162}

(4) _The Matter_.--Oil--"anointing him with oil".As in Baptism,
sanctified water is the ordained matter by which "Jesus Christ
cleanseth us from all sin"; so in Unction, consecrated oil is the
ordained matter used by the Holy Ghost to cleanse us from all
sickness--bodily, and (adds St."And if he have
committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."For this latter purpose, there are two Scriptural requirements:
_Confession_ and _Intercession_.For it follows: "Confess your faults
one to another, and pray for one another that ye may be healed".Thus
it is with Unction as with other Sacraments; with the "last" as with
the first--special grace is attached to special means.The Bible says
that, under certain conditions, oil and prayer together will effect
more than either oil or prayer apart; that oil without prayer cannot,
and prayer without oil will not, win the special grace of healing
guaranteed to the use of oil and prayer together.In our days, the use of anointing with prayer is (in alliance with, and
in addition to, Medical Science) being more fully recognized."The
Prayer of Faith" is coming into its own, and is being placed once more
in proper position in the {163} sphere of healing; _anointing_ is being
more and more used "according to the Scriptures".Both are being used
together in a simple belief in revealed truth.It often happens that
"the elders of the Church" are sent for by the sick; a simple service
is used; the sick man is anointed; the united "Prayer of Faith" (it
_must_ be "of Faith") is offered; and, if it be good for his spiritual
health, the sick man is "made whole of whatsoever disease he had".God give us in this, as in every other Sacrament, a braver, quieter,
more loving faith in His promises.The need still exists: the grace is
still to be had._If our love were but more simple,_
    _We should take Him at His word;_
  _And our lives would be all sunshine_
    _In the sweetness of our Lord._

possessed by a demoniac obduracy, and his apparent indifference is but
a part of a fell design to which I should be afraid to give a name.'"The priest was impressed by this view of the matter, which could not
but appeal successfully to a man's calm reason.'If a man is determined not to speak, I
have no power to compel him.'"'It is in your power,' I said, 'to prevent bloodshed.'"'Nothing less, I fear,' I said.'Lay an injunction upon the villagers
not to lend that man a boat, and not, under any pretext, to row him to
the lighthouse.'"'I am not at liberty to say more at the present moment,' I said.'I
shall not leave the village to-day.I myself will see that man's
brother, and will obtain permission from him to reveal all I know.Meanwhile give not that soul-tossed wretch the opportunity of carrying
out a scheme of ruthless vengeance which he has harboured for years.'"'Tell me explicitly what you wish me to do.'That man, with the connivance or assistance
of any person in this village, must not be enabled to get to the
lighthouse.'"And he mixed with the villagers, men and women, and laid upon them
the injunction I desired.With my mind thus set at ease for at least a
few hours, I engaged a couple of boatmen to row me to Silvain.I half
expected that Kristel would come forward with a request, made if not
in speech in dumb show, to be allowed to accompany me, and I had
resolved what action to take; but he made no step towards me.He gave
no indication even of a knowledge of what was taking place within a
dozen yards of him, although it was not possible that the putting off
of the boat from the shore could have escaped his observation."'If he is not deaf and dumb,' said one of the rowers, 'he must have
gone clean out of his senses.'"'Neither one nor the other,' thought I; 'he is nursing his vengeance,
and has decided upon some plan of action.'"Silvain and Avicia were on the outer gallery, and when I joined them
Silvain drew me aside."'You have news of Kristel,' he said.I nodded, and he continued: 'I
know without the telling."'No human,' he replied, with a sad smile.'I see him standing upon
the beach, looking towards us.'"In truth that was a physical impossibility, but I needed no further
proof of the mysterious insight with which Silvain was gifted.I
related to him all that had passed between me and Kristel and the
priest, and of the precautions taken to keep from Kristel the means of
reaching the lighthouse."'That will not prevent him from coming, said Silvain; 'he is a fine
swimmer.I myself, were I desperately pushed to it, would undertake to
swim to the village.You hold to your
promise, Louis, with respect to Avicia?'"'It is binding upon me,' I replied;'my word is given.'Neither will my child be left without a counsellor.Louis, I shall never see the face of my child--I shall never feel his
little hands about my neck!'"'Were it not for the tender sympathy I have for you,' I said in a
tone of reproof, 'I should feel inclined to be angry.Did you not
confess to me in former days that you could not see into the future?And here you are, raising up ghosts to make the present more bitter
than it is.Black as things appear, there are bright
years yet in store for you.'"'I cannot help my forebodings, Louis.True, I cannot, nor can any
man, see into the future, but what can I do to turn my brother's hate
from me?'It was a cry of anguish wrung from his suffering heart.'I
think of the days of our childhood, when we strolled in the woods with
our arms round each other's necks, I think of the dreams we mapped of
the future.Running water by the side of which we sat, bending over to
see our faces, and making our lips meet in a shadowed kiss, flowers we
picked in field and meadow, errands of mercy we went upon together,
twilight communings, the little sweethearts we had--all these innocent
ways of childhood rise before me, and fill me with anguish.What can I
do?--what can I do to bring him back to me in brotherly love?Louis, I
have a fear that I have never whispered to living soul.It is that
Avicia may have twin children, as Kristel and I are, and they should
grow up to be as we are now!Would it not be better that they should
be born dead, or die young, when their souls are not stained with
hatred of each other and with evil thoughts that render existence a
curse?'"We were alone when he gave expression to his agonised feelings;
Avicia had left us to attend to domestic duties.I could say nothing
to comfort him; to harp upon one string of intended consolation to a
man who is in no mood to accept it becomes, after a time, an
oppression.He paced up and down, twining his fingers convulsively,
and presently said,

"'It would be too much, Louis, to ask you to remain with me a little
while?'"'No,' I replied, 'it would not.Indeed, it was partly in my mind to
suggest it.The crisis you have dreaded for many years has come, and
if you wish me to stop with you a day or two I will willingly do so.It may be--I do not know how--that I can be of service to you.The
boatmen are waiting in the boat below.I will write a letter to my
wife, and they shall post it, informing her that I shall be absent
from home perhaps until the end of the week, by which time I hope the
cloud will have passed away.No thanks, Silvain; friendship would be a
poor and valueless thing if one shrank from a sacrifice so slight.'"I wrote my letter, and despatched it by the boatmen.Then we waited
for events; it was all that it was in our power to do."Avicia was very glad when she heard of my intention to remain with
them a while."'Your companionship will do him good,' she said.'He has no one but
me to talk to, and he speaks of but one subject.If this continues
long he will lose his reason.'"The day passed, and night came on.There was but scanty living
accommodation in the lighthouse, but a mattress was spread for me upon
the floor of the tiny kitchen; and there I was to sleep.Avicia and
Silvain wished me to occupy their bed, but I would not have it so.Before retiring to rest, Silvain and I passed two or three hours in
converse; I purposely led the conversation into foreign channels, and
when I wished him good-night I was rejoiced to perceive that I had
succeeded for a brief space in diverting his mind from the fears which
weighed so heavily upon him."Nothing occurred during the night to disturb us; I awoke early, and
lay waiting for sunrise; but no light came, and when, aroused by
Silvain, I left my bed and went to the outer gallery, I was surprised
to see that all surrounding space was wrapt in a thick mist."'A great storm will soon be upon us,' said Silvain."He was right; before noon the storm burst, and the sea was lashed
into fury.It was a relief to see the play of lightning upon the angry
waters, but it was terrible too, and I thought how awful and joyless a
lone life must be when spent in such a home.This second day seemed as
if it would never end, and it was only by my watch that I knew of the
approach of night.With the sounds of the storm in my ears I lay down
upon my mattress and fell asleep."I know not at what time of the night I awoke, but with black darkness
upon and around me, I found myself sitting up, listening to sounds
without which did not proceed from the conflict of the elements.At
first I could not decide whether they were real or but the refrain of
a dream by which I had been disturbed; soon, however, I received
indisputable evidence that they were not the creations of my fancy."The voice was Silvain's, and the words were uttered in outer space.When I retired to rest I had lain down in my clothes, removing only my
coat, and using it as a covering.I quickly put it on, and lit a lamp,
to which a chain was attached, by which means it could be held over
the walls of the lighthouse.The lamp was scarcely lighted, when
Avicia, but half dressed, rushed into the little room."Her eyes wandered round the room, seeking him.At that moment the
voice from without pierced the air."I threw my arms round Avicia, and held her fast.'Are you, too, leagued against
us?"It needed all my strength to restrain her from rushing out in her
wild delirium, perhaps to her destruction.I whispered to her
hurriedly that I intended to go to the outer gallery, and that she
should accompany me; and also that if she truly wished to be of
assistance to her husband she must be calm.She ceased instantly to
struggle, and said in a tone of suppressed excitement,

"'Come, then.'"I did not quit my hold of her, but I used now only one hand, which I
clasped firmly round her wrist, my other being required for the
lantern.The next moment we were standing upon the gallery, bending
over.It was pitch dark, and we could see nothing; even the white
spray of the waves, as they dashed against the stone walls, was not
visible to us; but we heard Silvain's voice, at intervals, appealing
in frenzied tones to Kristel, who, it needed not the evidence of sight
to know, was holding on to the chains and struggling with his brother.How the two came into that awful position was never discovered, and I
could only judge by inference that Kristel, in the dead of this deadly
night, had made his way by some means to the lighthouse, and was
endeavouring to effect an entrance, when Silvain, awakened by his
attempts, had gone out to him, and was instantly seized and dragged
down."So fearful and confused were the minutes that immediately followed
that I have but an indistinct impression of the occurrences of the
time, which will live ever within me as the most awful in my life.I
know that I never lost my grasp of Avicia, and that but for me she
would have flung herself over the walls; I know that the brothers were
engaged in a struggle for life and death, and that Silvain continued
to make the most pathetic appeals to Kristel to listen to him, and not
to stain his soul with blood; I know that in those appeals there were
the tenderest references to their boyhood's days, to the love which
had existed between them, each for the other, to trivial incidents in
their childhood, to their mother who worshipped them and was now
looking down upon them, to the hopes in which they had indulged of a
life of harmony and affection; I know that it struck me then as most
terrible that during the whole of the struggle no word issued from
Kristel's lips; I know that there were heartrending appeals from
Avicia to Kristel to spare her husband, and that there were tender
cries from her to Silvain, and from Silvain to her; I know that,
finding a loose chain on the gallery, I lowered it to the combatants,
and called out to Silvain--foolishly enough, in so far as he could
avail himself of it--to release himself from his brother's arms and
seize it, and that I and Avicia would draw him up to safety; I know
that in one vivid flash of lightning I saw the struggling forms and
the beautiful white spray of the waves; I know that Silvain's voice
grew fainter and fainter until it was heard no more; I know that there
was the sound of a heavy body or bodies falling into the sea, that a
shriek of woe and despair clove my heart like a knife, and that Avicia
lay in my arms moaning and trembling.I bore her tenderly into her
room, and laid her on her bed."The storm ceased; no sound was heard without.The rising sun filled
the eastern horizon with loveliest hues of saffron and crimson.The
sea was calm; there was no trace of tempest and human agony.By that
time Avicia was a mother, and lay with her babes pressed to her bosom.Silvain's fear was realised: he was the dead father of twin brothers."The assistant whom Avicia's father had engaged rowed me to the
village, and there I enlisted the services of a woman, who accompanied
me back to the lighthouse, and attended to Avicia.The mother lived
but two days after the birth of her babes.Until her last hour she was
delirious, but then she recovered her senses and recognised me."'My dear Silvain told me,' she said, in a weak, faint voice, 'that
you would be a friend to our children.Bless the few moments remaining
to me by assuring me that you will not desert them.'"I gave her the assurance for which she yearned, and she desired me to
call them by the names of Eric and Emilius.It rejoiced me that she
passed away in peace; strange as it may seem, it was an inexpressible
relief to her bruised heart that the long agony was over.Her last
words were,

"'I trust you."And so, with her nerveless hand in mine, her spirit went out to her
lover and husband."We buried her in the village churchyard, and the day was observed as
a day of mourning in that village by the sea."I thought I could not do better than leave the twin babes for a time
in the charge of the woman I had engaged, and it occurred to me that
it might not be unprofitable to have some inquiries and investigation
made with respect to the inheritance left by their grandfather to his
sons Kristel and Silvain.I placed the matter in the hands of a shrewd
lawyer, and he was enabled to recover a portion of what was due to
their father.This was a great satisfaction to me, as it to some
extent provided for the future of Eric and Emilius, and supplied the
wherewithal for their education.It was my intention, when they
arrived at a certain age, to bring them to my home in Nerac, and treat
them as children of my own, but a difficulty cropped up for which I
was not prepared and which I could not surmount.Avicia's father,
learning that I had recovered a portion of Silvain's inheritance,
demanded from me an account of it, and asserted his rights as the
natural guardian of his grandchildren.There was no gainsaying the
demand, and I was compelled reluctantly to leave Eric and Emilius in
his charge.I succeeded, however, in prevailing upon him to allow them
to pay me regular visits of long duration, so that a close intimacy of
affectionate friendship has been established between them and the
members of my family.Here ends my story--a strange and eventful one,
you will admit.I often think of it in wonder, and this is the first
time a full recital of it has passed my lips."Such a story, which Doctor Louis truly described as strange and
eventful, could not have failed to leave a deep impression upon me.During its recital I had, as it were, been charmed out of myself.My
instinctive distrust of the twin brothers Eric and Emilius, the growth
of a groundless jealousy, was for a while forgotten, and at the
conclusion of the recital I was lost in the contemplation of the
tragic pictures which had been presented to my mind's eye.Singularly
enough, the most startling bit of colour in these pictures, that of
the two brothers in their life and death struggle on the outer walls
of the lighthouse, was not to me the dominant feature of the
remarkable story.The awful, unnatural contest, Avicias agony,
Silvain's soul-moving appeals, and the dread silence of Kristel--all
this was as nought in comparison with the figure of a solitary man
standing on the seashore, gazing in the direction of his lost
happiness.I traced his life back through the years during which he
was engaged in his relentless pursuit of the brother who had brought
desolation into his life.In him, and in him alone, was centred the
true pathos of the story; it was he who had been robbed, it was he who
had been wronged.No deliberate act of treachery lay at his door; he
loved, and had been deceived.Those in whom he placed his trust had
deliberately betrayed him.The vengeance he sought and consummated was
just.I did not make Doctor Louis acquainted with my views on the subject,
knowing that he would not agree with me, and that all his sympathies
were bestowed upon Silvain.There was something of cowardice in this
concealment of my feelings, but although I experienced twinges of
conscience for my want of courage, it was not difficult for me to
justify myself in my own eyes.Doctor Louis was the father of the
woman I loved, and in his hands lay my happiness.On no account must I
instil doubt into his mind; he was a man of decided opinions,
dogmatic, and strong-willed.No act or word of mine must cause him to
have the least distrust of me.Therefore I played the cunning part,
and was silent with respect to those threads in the story which
possessed the firmest hold upon his affections.This enforced silence accentuated and strengthened my view.Silvain
and Avicia were weak, feeble creatures.The man of great heart and
resolute will, the man whose sufferings and wrongs made him a martyr,
was Kristel.Trustful, heroic,
unflinching.But he and his brother, and the woman
who had been the instrument of their fate, belonged to the past.They
were dead and gone, and in the presence of Doctor Louis I put them
aside a while.Time enough to think of them when I was alone.They lived, and between their
lives and mine there was a link.Of this I entertained no doubt, nor
did I doubt that, in this connection, the future would not be
colourless for us.To be prepared for the course which events might
take: this was now my task and my duty."As Kristel acted, so would I act, in love and hate."I observed Doctor Louis's eyes fixed earnestly upon my face."Is not such a story," I said evasively, "enough to agitate one?Its
movements are as the movements of a sublime tragedy.""True," mused Doctor Louis; "even in obscure lives may be found such
elements.""You have told me little," I said, "of Eric and Emilius.Do they
reside permanently in the lighthouse in which their mother died?""They have a house in the village by the sea," replied Doctor Louis,
"and they are in a certain sense fishermen on a large scale.The place
has possessed for them a fascination, and it seemed as if they would
never be able to tear themselves away from it.But their intimate
association with it will soon be at an end.""They have sold their house and boats, and are coming to reside in
Nerac for a time."I started and turned aside, for I did not wish Doctor Louis to see the
cloud upon my face."It depends upon circumstances," said Doctor Louis."If they are happy
and contented in the present and in their prospects in the future,
they will remain.We have talked of it
often, and I have urged them not to waste their lives in a village so
small and primitive as that in which they were born.""Somewhat destructive of your own theories of happiness, doctor," I
observed."Yourself, for instance, wasting your life in a small place
like Nerac, when by your gifts you are so well fitted to play your
part in a large city.""I am selfish, I am afraid," he said with a deprecatory smile, "and am
too much wrapped up in my own ease and comfort.At the same time you
must bear in mind that mine is an exceptional case.It is a regretful
thing to be compelled to say that the majority of lives and homes are
less happy than my own.Often there is love, and poverty stands at the
bright door which opens but on a scene of privation and ill-requited
toil.Often there is wealth, in the use of which there has been an
endeavour to purchase love, which, my friend, is not a marketable
commodity.Often there are sorrow and sickness, and neither faith nor
patience to lighten the load.It is my good fortune to have none of
these ills.We have love and good health, and a sufficient share of
worldly prosperity to provide for our days.Therefore I will leave
myself out of the question.he cried, interrupting himself in a
tone at once light and earnest; "am I entirely useless in Nerac?"You do much," I said, "and also do Eric and Emilius in their village.You have admitted that they are fishermen on a large scale, and
possess boats.Consequently they employ labour, and the wages they pay
support the homes of those who serve them.""With some young men," said Doctor Louis, with a good-humoured laugh,
"there is no arguing.They are so keen in defence that they have a
formidable parry for every thrust.To the point, then, without
argument.Eric and Emilius have in them certain qualities which render
me doubtful whether, as middle-aged men, they would be in their proper
sphere in their village by the sea.The maidens there find no serious
favour in their eyes.""Do they look," I asked, with a torturing pang of jealousy, "with a
more appreciative eye upon the maidens in Nerac?""Tush, tush," said Doctor Louis, in a kind tone, laying his hand upon
my shoulder; "vex not yourself unnecessarily.Youth's hot blood is a
torrent, restless by day and night, never satisfied, never content,
for ever seeking cause to fret and fume.You have given evidence of
wisdom, Gabriel--exercise it when it is most needed."Of all the maidens in Nerac," I said, striving to speak with
calmness, "Lauretta is the fairest and sweetest."I, her father, will not gainsay you.""Is it because she is fairer and sweeter than any Eric and Emilius
have seen in the village by the sea that they quit their home there,
and come to live in Nerac?"Were I simply an ordinary friend of yours, and not
Lauretta's father, I might feel inclined to play with you; but as
it is, my happiness here is too largely at stake.Viewing with a selfish eye--a human failing, common
enough--your own immediate affairs, forget not that I, Lauretta's
father, am as deeply concerned in them as yourself.Never would I be
guilty of the crime of forcing my child's affections.Do you think I
love her less than you do?If it should be your happy fate to be a
father, you will learn how much purer and higher is the love of a
father than that which a young man, after an hour's acquaintance,
bears for the maiden whom he would wed.""It cannot be said to be more," responded Doctor Louis gravely,
"compared with my knowledge of my child."The retort was well-merited, and I murmured, "Forgive me!"The
consistently sweet accents of Doctor Louis's voice produced in me, at
this moment, a feeling of self-reproach, and a true sense of my
petulance and imperiousness forced itself upon me."There is little need to ask forgiveness," said Doctor Louis; "I can
make full allowance for the impetuous passions of youth, and if I wish
you to place a curb upon them it is for your welfare and that of my
child.Indulgence in such extravagances leads to injustice.Gabriel, I
will be entirely frank with you.Before your arrival in Nerac I had a
slight suspicion that one of the brothers--towards both of whom I feel
as a father--had an affection for Lauretta which might have ripened
into love.It is in the nature of things that a beautiful girl should
inspire a sentiment in the breasts of more than one man, but she can
belong only to one, to him to whom her heart is drawn.What passed
between us when you spoke to me as a lover of my daughter was honest
and outspoken.The encouragement you received from me would have been
withheld had it not been that I saw you occupied a place in Lauretta's
heart, and that the one end and aim I have in view is her happiness.""Is it too much to ask," I said, "to which of the brothers you
referred?""Altogether too much," replied Doctor Louis."It is an unrevealed
secret, and the right is not mine to say more than I have said."I did not speak for a little while; I was the slave of conflicting
passions.One moment I believed entirely in Doctor Louis; another
moment I doubted him; and through all I was oppressed by a
consciousness that I was doing him an injustice."Nothing special, sir," was my
reply, "but in a general way.""Born under such singular circumstances, and of such a father as
Silvain, it would not be unnatural to suppose that they might inherit
some touch of his strangely sympathetic nature.""They have inherited it," said Doctor Louis; "there exists between
them a sympathy as strange as that which existed in Silvain.I am at
liberty to say nothing more."He spoke in a firm tone, and I did not question him further.As I
accompanied him home we conversed upon general subjects, and I took
pains to convey to him an assurance that there was nothing really
serious in the ungracious temper I had displayed.He was relieved at
this, and we fell into our old confidential manner with each other.I passed the evening, as usual, in the society of his wife and
Lauretta.Peace descended upon me, and in the sweet presence of these
pure women I was tranquil and happy.How lovely, how beautiful was
this home of love and tender thought!The wild storms of life died
away, and strains of soft, angelic music melted the heart, and made
themselves heard even in the midst of the silences.Doctor Louis's
gaiety returned to him; he smiled upon me, and indulged in many a
harmless jest.I was charmed out of my moody humour, and contributed
to the innocent enjoyment of the home circle.The hours passed till it
was near bed-time, and then it was that a change came over me.Sitting
by Lauretta's side, turning the pages of an illustrated book of
travel, I heard the names of Eric and Emilius spoken by Doctor Louis.He was telling his wife of the impending change in their mode of life,
and there was an affectionate note in his voice, and also in hers,
which jarred upon me.I started to my feet, and they all turned to me
in surprise.I recovered myself in a moment, and explained that I had
suddenly thought of something which rendered it necessary that I
should go at once to the house I had taken, and of which Martin Hartog
was at present the sole custodian."But you were not to leave us till the end of the week," expostulated
Lauretta's mother."Indeed it is," I replied, "and should have been attended to earlier."You need have no anxiety; everything is prepared, and I
shall be quite comfortable.""My wife is thinking of the sheets," observed Doctor Louis jocosely;
"whether they are properly aired.""I have seen to that," she said, "and there is a fire in every room.""Then we can safely let him go," rejoined Doctor Louis."He is old
enough to take care of himself, and, besides, he is now a householder,
and has duties.We shall see you to-morrow, Gabriel?""Yes, I shall be here in the morning."So I wished them good-night, and presently was out in the open,
walking through dark shadows.In solitude I reviewed with amazement the occurrences of the last few
moments.It seemed to me that I had been impelled to do what I had
done by an occult agency outside myself.Not that I did not approve of
it.It was in accordance with my intense wish and desire--which had
lain dormant in the sweet society of Lauretta--to be alone, in order
that I might, without interruption, think over the story I had heard
from Doctor Louis's lips.And now that this wish and desire were
gratified, the one figure which still rose vividly before me was the
figure of Kristel.As I walked onward I followed the hapless man
mentally in his just pursuit of the brother who had snatched the cup
of happiness from his lips.Yes, it was just and right, and what he
did I would have done under similar circumstances.Of all who had
taken part in the tragic drama he, and he alone, commanded my
sympathy.The distance from Doctor Louis's house to mine was under two miles,
but I prolonged it by a _detour_ which brought me, without
premeditation, to the inn known as the Three Black Crows.I had no
intention of going there or of entering the inn, and yet, finding
myself at the door, I pushed it open, and walked into the room in
which the customers took their wine.This room was furnished with
rough tables and benches, and I seated myself, and in response to the
landlord's inquiry, ordered a bottle of his best, and invited him to
share it with me.He, nothing loth, accepted the invitation, and sat
at the table, emptying his glass, which I continued to fill for him,
while my own remained untasted.I had been inside the Three Black
Crows on only one occasion, in the company of Doctor Louis, and the
landlord now expressed his gratitude for the honour I did him by
paying him another visit.It was only the sense of his words which
reached my ears, my attention being almost entirely drawn to two men
who were seated at a table at the end of the room, drinking bad wine
and whispering to each other.Observing my eyes upon them, the
landlord said in a low tone, "Strangers."Their backs were towards me, and I could not see their faces, but I
noticed that one was humpbacked, and that, to judge from their attire,
they were poor peasants."I asked them," said the landlord, "whether they wanted a bed, and
they answered no, that they were going further.If they had stopped
here the night I should have kept watch on them!""I don't like their looks, and my wife's a timorous creature.Then
there's the children--you've seen my little ones, I think, sir?"Surely those men would do them no harm!""Perhaps not, sir; but a man, loving those near to him, thinks of the
possibilities of things.I've got a bit of money in the house, to pay
my rent that's due to-morrow, and one or two other accounts."Do you think they have come to Nerac on a robbing expedition?"Roguery has a plain face, and the signs are in
theirs, or my name's not what it is.When they said they were going
further on I asked them where, and they said it was no business of
mine.They gave me the same answer when I asked them where they came
from.They're up to no good, that's certain, and the sooner they're
out of the village the better for all of us."The more the worthy landlord talked the more settled became his
instinctive conviction that the strangers were rogues."If robbery is their errand," I said thoughtfully, "there are houses
in Nerac which would yield them a better harvest than yours.""Of course there is," was his response.He
has generally some money about him, and his silver plate would be a
prize.Are you going back there to-night, sir?""No; I am on my road to my own house, and I came out of the way a
little for the sake of the walk.""That's my profit, sir," said the landlord cheerfully."I would offer
to keep you company if it were not that I don't like to leave my
place.""There's nothing to fear," I said; "if they molest me I shall be a
match for them.""Still," urged the landlord, "I should leave before they do.It's as
well to avoid a difficulty when we have the opportunity."I took the hint, and paid my score.To all appearance there was no
reason for alarm on my part; during the time the landlord and I were
conversing the strangers had not turned in our direction, and as we
spoke in low tones they could not have heard what we said.They
remained in the same position, with their backs towards us, now
drinking in silence, now speaking in whispers to each other.Outside the Three Black Crows I walked slowly on, but I had not gone
fifty yards before I stopped.What was in my mind was the reference
made by the landlord to Doctor Louis's house and to its being worth
the plundering.The doctor's house contained what was dearer to me
than life or fortune.Should I leave her at the
mercy of these scoundrels who might possibly have planned a robbery of
the doctor's money and plate?In that case Lauretta would be in
danger.I would return to the Three
Black Crows, and look through the window of the room in which I had
left the men, to ascertain whether they were still there.If they
were, I would wait for them till they left the inn, and then would set
a watch upon their movements.If they were gone I would hasten to the
doctor's house, to render assistance, should any be needed.I had no
weapon, with the exception of a small knife; could I not provide
myself with something more formidable?A few paces from where I stood
were some trees with stout branches.I detached one of these branches,
and with my small knife fashioned it into a weapon which would serve
my purpose.It was about four feet in length, thick at the striking
end and tapering towards the other, so that it could be held with ease
and used to good purpose.I tried it on the air, swinging it round and
bringing it down with sufficient force to kill a man, or with
certainty to knock the senses out of him in one blow.Then I returned
to the inn, and looked through the window.In the settlement of my
proceedings I had remembered there was a red blind over the window
which did not entirely cover it, and through the uncovered space I now
saw the strangers sitting at the table as I had left them.Taking care to make no noise I stepped away from the window, and took
up a position from which I could see the door of the inn, which was
closed.I myself was in complete darkness, and there was no moon to
betray me; all that was needed from me was caution.I watched fully half an hour before the door of the inn was opened.No
person had entered during my watch, the inhabitants of Nerac being
early folk for rest and work.The two strangers lingered for a moment
upon the threshold, peering out into the night; behind them was the
landlord, with a candle in his hand.I did not observe that any words
passed between them and the landlord; they stepped into the road, and
the door was closed upon them.Then came the sounds of locking and
bolting doors and windows.I saw the faces of the men as they stood upon the threshold; they were
evil-looking fellows enough, and their clothes were of the commonest.For two or three minutes they did not stir; there had been nothing in
their manner to arouse suspicion, and the fact of their lingering on
the roadway seemed to denote that they were uncertain of the route
they should take.That they raised their faces to the sky was not
against them; it was a natural seeking for light to guide them.To the left lay the little nest of buildings amongst which were Father
Daniel's chapel and modest house, and the more pretentious dwelling of
Doctor Louis; to the right were the woods, at the entrance of which my
own house was situated.The left,
and it was part evidence of a guilty design.The right, and it would
be part proof that the landlord's suspicions were baseless.They exchanged a few words which did not reach my ears.Then they
moved onwards to the left.I grasped my weapon, and crept after them.But they walked only a dozen steps, and paused.In my mind
was the thought, "Continue the route you have commenced, and you are
dead men.The direction of the village was the more tempting to men who
had no roof to shelter them, for the reason that in Father Daniel's
chapel--which, built on an eminence, overlooked the village--lights
were visible from the spot upon which I and they were standing.There
was the chance of a straw bed and charity's helping hand, never
withheld by the good priest from the poor and wretched.On their right
was dense darkness; not a glimmer of light.Nevertheless, after the exchange of a few more words which, like the
others, were unheard by me, they seemed to resolve to seek the
gloomier way.They turned from the village, and facing me, walked past
me in the direction of the woods.I breathed more freely, and fell into a curious mental consideration
of the relief I experienced.Was it because, walking as they were from
the village in which Lauretta was sleeping, I was spared the taking of
these men's lives?It was because of the indication they afforded
me that Lauretta was not in peril.In her defence I could have
justified the taking of a hundred lives.No feeling of guilt would
have haunted me; there would have been not only no remorse but no pity
in my soul.The violation of the most sacred of human laws would be
justified where Lauretta was concerned.She was mine, to cherish, to
protect, to love--mine, inalienably.She belonged to no other man, and
none should step between her and me--neither he whose ruffianly design
threatened her with possible harm, nor he, in a higher and more
polished grade, who strove to win her affections and wrest them from
me.In an equal way both were equally my enemies, and I should be
justified in acting by them as Kristel had acted to Silvain.Ah, but he had left it too late.Not so would I. Let but the faintest
breath of certainty wait upon suspicion, and I would scotch it
effectually for once and all.Had Kristel possessed the strange power
in his hours of dreaming which Silvain possessed, he would not have
been robbed of the happiness which was his by right.He would have
been forewarned, and Avicia would have been his wife.In every step in
life he took there would have been the fragrance of flowers around
him, and a heavenly light.Did I, then, admit that there was any resemblance in the characters of
Avicia and Lauretta?No; one was a weed, the other a rose.Here low desire and cunning; there
angelic purity and goodness.But immeasurably beneath Lauretta as
Avicia was, Kristel's love for the girl would have made her radiant
and spotless.All this time I was stealthily following the strangers to the woods.The sound arrested them; they clutched each other in
fear.I stood motionless, and they stood without movement for many moments.Then they simultaneously emitted a deep-drawn sigh."It was the wind," said the man who had already spoken.I smiled in contempt; not a breath of wind was stirring; there was not
the flutter of a leaf, not the waving of the lightest branch.They resumed their course, and I crept after them noiselessly.They
entered the wood; the trees grew more thickly clustered."This will do," I heard one say; and upon the words they threw
themselves to the ground, and fell into slumber.I bent over them and was
satisfied.The landlord of the Three Black Crows was mistaken.I moved
softly away, and when I was at a safe distance from them I lit a match
and looked at my watch; it was twenty minutes to eleven, and before
the minute-hand had passed the hour I arrived at my house.The door
was fast, but I saw a light in the lower room of the gardener's
cottage, which I had given to Martin Hartog as a residence for him and
his daughter."Hartog is awake," I thought; "expecting me perhaps."I knocked at the door of the cottage, and received no answer; I
knocked again with the same result.The door had fastenings of lock and latch.I put my hand to the latch,
and finding that the key had not been turned in the lock, opened the
door and entered.The room, however, was not without an occupant.At the table sat a
young girl, the gardener's daughter, asleep.She lay back in her
chair, and the light shone upon her face.I had seen her when she was
awake, and knew that she was beautiful, but as I gazed now upon her
sleeping form I was surprised to discover that she was even fairer
than I had supposed.She had hair of dark brown, which curled most
gracefully about her brow and head; her face, in its repose, was sweet
to look upon; she was not dressed as the daughter of a labouring man,
but with a certain daintiness and taste which deepened my surprise;
there was lace at her sleeves and around her white neck.Had I not
known her station I should have taken her for a lady.She was young,
not more than eighteen or nineteen I judged, and life's springtime lay
sweetly upon her.There was a smile of wistful tenderness on her lips.Her left arm was extended over the table, and her hand rested upon the
portrait of a man, almost concealing the features.Her right hand,
which was on her lap, enfolded a letter, and that and the
portrait--which, without curious prying, I saw was not that of her
father--doubtless were the motive of a pleasant dream.I took in all this in a momentary glance, and quickly left the room,
closing the door behind me.Then I knocked loudly and roughly, and
heard the hurried movements of a sudden awaking.She came to the door
and cried softly, "Is that you, father?She opened the door, and fell back a step in confusion."I should have let your father know," I said, "that I intended to
sleep here to-night--but indeed it was a hasty decision."Oh, no, sir," she said.Father is away on
business; I expected him home earlier, and waiting for him I fell
asleep.The servants are not coming till to-morrow morning."She gave them to me, and asked if she could do anything for me.I
answered no, that there was nothing required.As I wished her
good-night a man's firm steps were heard, and Martin Hartog appeared.He cast swift glances at his daughter and me, and it struck me that
they were not devoid of suspicion.I explained matters, and he
appeared contented with my explanation; then bidding his daughter go
indoors he accompanied me to the house.There was a fire in my bedroom, almost burnt out, and the handiwork of
an affectionate and capable housewife was everywhere apparent.Martin
Hartog showed an inclination then and there to enter into particulars
of the work he had done in the grounds during my absence, but I told
him I was tired, and dismissed him.I listened to his retreating
footsteps, and when I heard the front door closed I blew out the
candle and sat before the dying embers in the grate.Darkness was best
suited to my mood, and I sat and mused upon the events of the last
forty-eight hours.Gradually my thoughts became fixed upon the figures
of the two strangers I had left sleeping in the woods, in connection
with the suspicion of their designs which the landlord had imparted to
me.So concentrated was my attention that I re-enacted all the
incidents of which they were the inspirers--the fashioning of the
branch into a weapon, the watch I had set upon them, their issuing
from the inn, the landlord standing behind with the candle in his
hand, their lingering in the road, the first steps they took towards
the village, their turning back, and my stealthy pursuit after
them--not the smallest detail was omitted.I do not remember
undressing and going to bed.Encompassed by silence and darkness I was
only spiritually awake.I was aroused at about eight o'clock in the morning by the arrival of
the servants of the household whom Lauretta's mother had engaged for
me, They comprised a housekeeper, who was to cook and generally
superintend, and two stout wenches to do the rougher work.In such a
village as Nerac these, in addition to Martin Hartog, constituted an
establishment of importance.They had been so well schooled by Lauretta's mother before commencing
the active duties of their service, that when I rose I found the
breakfast-table spread, and the housekeeper in attendance to receive
my orders.This augured well, and I experienced a feeling of
satisfaction at the prospect of the happy life before me.Lauretta would be not only a sweet and loving
companion, but the same order and regularity would reign in our home
as in the home of her childhood.I blessed the chance, if chance it
was, which had led me to Nerac, and as I paced the room and thought of
Lauretta, I said audibly, "Thank God!"Breakfast over, I strolled into the grounds, and made a careful
inspection of the work which Martin Hartog had performed.The
conspicuous conscientiousness of his labours added to my satisfaction,
and I gave expression to it.He received my approval in manly fashion,
and said he would be glad if I always spoke my mind, "as I always
speak mine," he added.It pleased me that he was not subservient; in
all conditions of life a man owes it to himself to maintain, within
proper bounds, a spirit of independence.While he was pointing out to
me this and that, and urging me to make any suggestions which occurred
to me, his daughter came up to us and said that a man wished to speak
to me.I asked who the man was, and she replied, "The landlord of the
Three Black Crows."Curious as to his purpose in making so early a
call, and settling it with myself that his errand was on business, in
connection, perhaps, with some wine he wished to dispose of, I told
the young woman to send him to me, and presently he appeared.There
was an expression of awkwardness, I thought, in his face as he stood
before me, cap in hand."Well, landlord," I said smiling; "you wish to see me?""Go on," I said, wondering somewhat at his hesitation."Can I speak to you alone, sir?"Hartog, I will see you again presently."Martin Hartog took the hint, and left us together."It's about those two men, sir, you saw in my place last night."I said, pondering, and then a light broke upon me,
and I thought it singular--as indeed it was--that no recollection,
either of the men or the incidents in association with them should
have occurred to me since my awaking."_You_ are quite safe, sir," said the landlord, "I am glad to find.""Quite safe, landlord; but why should you be so specially glad?""That's what brought me round so early this morning, for one thing; I
was afraid something _might_ have happened.""Kindly explain yourself," I said, not at all impatient, but amused
rather."Well, sir, they might have found out, somehow or other, that you were
sleeping in the house alone last night"--and here he broke off and
asked, "You _did_ sleep here alone last night?""Certainly I did, and a capital night's rest I had."As I was saying, if they had found out that
you were sleeping here alone, they might have taken it into their
heads to trouble you.""They might, landlord, but facts are stubborn things."I understand that now, sir, but I had my fears, and that's what
brought me round for one thing.""An expression you have used once before, landlord.I
infer there must be another thing in your mind.""As yet I have heard nothing but a number of very enigmatical
observations from you with respect to those men.Ah, yes, I remember;
you had your doubts of them when I visited you on my road home?""I had sir; I told you I didn't like the looks of them, and that I was
not easy in my mind about my own family, and the bit of money I had in
my place to pay my rent with, and one or two other accounts.""That is so; you are bringing the whole affair back to me.I saw the
men after I left the Three Black Crows.""To tell you would be to interrupt what you have come here to say."Well, sir, this is the way of it.I suspected them from the first,
and you will bear witness of it before the magistrate.They were
strangers in Nerac, but that is no reason why I should have refused to
sell them a bottle of red wine when they asked for it.It's my trade
to supply customers, and the wine was the worst I had, consequently
the cheapest.I had no right to ask their business, and if they chose
to answer me uncivilly, it was their affair.I wouldn't tell everybody
mine on the asking.They paid for the wine, and there was an end of
it.They called for another bottle, and when I brought it I did not
draw the cork till I had the money for it, and as they wouldn't pay
the price--not having it about 'em--the cork wasn't drawn, and the
bottle went back.I had trouble to get rid of them, but they stumbled
out at last, and I saw no more of them.Now, sir, you will remember
that when we were speaking of them Doctor Louis's house was mentioned
as a likely house for rogues to break into and rob.""The villains couldn't hear what we said, no more than we could hear
what they were whispering about.But they had laid their plans, and
tried to hatch them--worse luck for one, if not for both the
scoundrels; but the other will be caught and made to pay for it.What
they did between the time they left the Three Black Crows and the time
they made an attempt to break into Doctor Louis's is at present a
mystery.Don't be alarmed, sir; I see that my news has stirred you,
but they have only done harm to themselves.No one else is a bit the
worse for their roguery.Doctor Louis and his good wife and daughter
slept through the night undisturbed; nothing occurred to rouse or
alarm them.They got up as usual, the doctor being the first--he is
known as an early riser.As it happened, it was fortunate that he was
outside his house before his lady, for although we in Nerac have an
idea that she is as brave as she is good, a woman, after all, is only
a woman, and the sight of blood is what few of them can stand."But that I was assured that
Lauretta was safe and well, I should not have wasted a moment on the
landlord, eager as I was to learn what he had come to tell.My mind,
however, was quite at ease with respect to my dear girl, and the next
few minutes were not so precious that I could not spare them to hear
the landlord's strange story."That," he resumed, "is what the doctor saw when he went to the back
of his house.Blood on the ground--and what is more, what would have
given the ladies a greater shock, there before him was the body of a
man--dead.""That I can't for a certainty say, sir, because I haven't seen him as
yet.I'm telling the story second-hand, as it was told to me a while
ago by one who had come straight from the doctor's house.There was
the blood, and there the man; and from the description I should say it
was one of the men who were drinking in my place last night.It is not
ascertained at what time of the night he and his mate tried to break
into the doctor's house, but the attempt was made.They commenced to bore a hole in one of the shutters
at the back; the hole made, it would have been easy to enlargen it,
and so to draw the fastenings.However, they did not get so far as
that.They could scarcely have been at their scoundrelly work a minute
or two before it came to an end.""How and by whom were they interrupted, landlord?"It is not known, sir, and it's just at this point that the mystery
commences.There they are at their work, and likely to be successful.A dark night, and not a watchman in the village.Never a need for one,
sir.Plenty of time before them, and desperate men they.Only one man
in the house, the good doctor; all the others women, easily dealt
with.Robbery first--if interfered with, murder afterwards.They
wouldn't have stuck at it, not they!But there it was, sir, as God
willed.Not a minute at work, and something occurs.The man lies dead on the ground, with a gimlet in his hand, and
Doctor Louis, in full sunlight, stands looking down on the strange
sight.""The man lies dead on the ground," I said, repeating the landlord's
words; "but there were two.""No sign of the other, sir; he's a vanished body."He will be found," I said----

"It's to be hoped," interrupted the landlord."And then what you call a mystery will be solved.""It's beyond me, sir," said the landlord, with a puzzled air.These two scoundrels, would-be murderers, plan a
robbery, and proceed to execute it.They are ill-conditioned
creatures, no better than savages, swayed by their passions, in which
there is no show of reason.They quarrel, perhaps, about the share of
the spoil which each shall take, and are not wise enough to put aside
their quarrel till they are in possession of the booty.They continue
their dispute, and in such savages their brutal passions once roused,
swell and grow to a fitting climax of violence.Probably the disagreement commenced on their way to the house, and had
reached an angry point when one began to bore a hole in the shutter.The proof was in his hand--the
gimlet with which he was working.""Well conceived, sir," said the landlord, following with approval my
speculative explanation."This man's face," I continued, "would be turned toward the shutter,
his back to his comrade.Into this comrade's mind darts, like a
lightning flash, the idea of committing the robbery alone, and so
becoming the sole possessor of the treasure.""Good, sir, good," said the landlord, rubbing his hands.Out comes his knife, or perhaps he
has it ready in his hand, opened.""No; such men carry clasp-knives.They are safest, and never attract
notice.""You miss nothing, sir," said the landlord admiringly."What a
magistrate you would have made!""He plunges it into his fellow-scoundrel's back, who falls dead, with
the gimlet in his hand.The landlord nodded excitedly, and continued to rub his hands; then
suddenly stood quite still, with an incredulous expression on his
face."But the robbery is not committed," he exclaimed; "the house is not
broken into, and the scoundrel gets nothing for his pains."With superior wisdom I laid a patronising hand upon his shoulder."The deed done," I said, "the murderer, gazing upon his dead comrade,
is overcome with fear.He has been rash--he may be caught red-handed;
the execution of the robbery will take time.He is not familiar with
the habits of the village, and does not know it has no guardians of
the night.He has not only committed murder, he has robbed himself.Better
to have waited till they had possession of the treasure; but this kind
of logic always comes afterwards to ill-regulated minds.Under the
influence of his newly-born fears he recognises that every moment is
precious; he dare not linger; he dare not carry out the scheme.Shuddering, he flies from the spot, with rage and despair in his
heart.The landlord, who was profuse in the expressions of his admiration at
the light I had thrown upon the case, so far as it was known to us,
accompanied me to the house of Doctor Louis.It was natural that I
should find Lauretta and her mother in a state of agitation, and it
was sweet to me to learn that it was partly caused by their anxieties
for my safety.Doctor Louis was not at home, but had sent a messenger
to my house to inquire after me, and to give me some brief account of
the occurrences of the night.We did not meet this messenger on our
way to the doctor's; he must have taken a different route from ours."You did wrong to leave us last night," said Lauretta's mother
chidingly.I shook my head, and answered that it was but anticipating the date of
my removal by a few days, and that my presence in her house would not
have altered matters."Everything was right at home," I said.What inexpressible
sweetness there was in the word!"Martin Hartog showed me to my room,
and the servants you engaged came early this morning, and attended to
me as though they had known my ways and tastes for years.""A dreamless night," I replied; "but had I suspected what was going on
here, I should not have been able to rest.""I am glad you had no suspicion, Gabriel; you would have been in
danger.Dreadful as it all is, it is a comfort to know that the
misguided men do not belong to our village."Her merciful heart could find no harsher term than this to apply to
the monsters, and it pained her to hear me say, "One has met his
deserved fate; it is a pity the other has escaped."But I could not
keep back the words.Doctor Louis had left a message for me to follow him to the office of
the village magistrate, where the affair was being investigated, but
previous to going thither, I went to the back of the premises to make
an inspection.The village boasted of one constable, and he was now on
duty, in a state of stupefaction.His orders were to allow nothing to
be disturbed, but his bewilderment was such that it would have been
easy for an interested person to do as he pleased in the way of
alteration.A stupid lout, with as much intelligence as a vegetable.However, I saw at once that nothing had been disturbed.The shutter in
which a hole had been bored was closed; there were blood stains on the
stones, and I was surprised that they were so few; the gate by which
the villains had effected an entrance into the garden was open; I
observed some particles of sawdust on the window-ledge just below
where the hole had been bored.All that had been removed was the body
of the man who had been murdered by his comrade.I put two or three questions to the constable, and he managed to
answer in monosyllables, yes and no, at random."A valuable
assistant," I thought, "in unravelling a mysterious case!"And then I
reproached myself for the sneer.Happy was a village like Nerac in
which crime was so rare, and in which an official so stupid was
sufficient for the execution of the law.The first few stains of blood I noticed were close to the window, and
the stones thereabout had been disturbed, as though by the falling of
a heavy body."Was the man's body," I inquired of the constable, "lifted from this
spot?"He looked down vacantly and said, "Yes.""Sure," he said after a pause, but whether the word was spoken in
reply to my question, or as a question he put to himself, I could not
determine.From the open gate to the
window was a distance of forty-eight yards; I stepped exactly a yard,
and I counted my steps.The path from gate to window was shaped like
the letter S, and was for the most part defined by tall shrubs on
either side, of a height varying from six to nine feet.Through this
path the villains had made their way to the window; through this path
the murderer, leaving his comrade dead, had made his escape.Their
operations, for their own safety's sake, must undoubtedly have been
conducted while the night was still dark.Reasonable also to conclude
that, being strangers in the village (although by some means they must
have known beforehand that Doctor Louis's house was worth the
plundering), they could not have been acquainted with the devious
turns in the path from the gate to the window.Therefore they must
have felt their way through, touching the shrubs with their hands,
most likely breaking some of the slender stalks, until they arrived at
the open space at the back of the building.These reflections impelled me to make a careful inspection of the
shrubs, and I was very soon startled by a discovery.Here and there
some stalks were broken and torn away, and here and there were
indisputable evidences that the shrubs had been grasped by human
hands.It was not this that startled me, for it was in accordance with
my own train of reasoning, but it was that there were stains of blood
on the broken stalks, especially upon those which had been roughly
torn from the parent tree.I seemed to see a man, with blood about
him, staggering blindly through the path, snatching at the shrubs both
for support and guidance, and the loose stalks falling from his hands
as he went.Two men entered the grounds, only one left--that one, the
murderer.Between
the victim and the perpetrator of the deed?In that case, what became
of the theory of action I had so elaborately described to the landlord
of the Three Black Crows?I had imagined an instantaneous impulse of
crime and its instantaneous execution.I had imagined a death as
sudden as it was violent, a deed from which the murderer had escaped
without the least injury to himself; and here, on both sides of me,
were the clearest proofs that the man who had fled must have been
grievously wounded.My ingenuity was at fault in the endeavour to
bring these signs into harmony with the course of events I had
invented in my interview with the landlord.I went straight to the office of the magistrate, a small building of
four rooms on the ground floor, the two in front being used as the
magistrate's private room and court, the two in the rear as cells, not
at all uncomfortable, for aggressors of the law.It was but rarely
that they were occupied.At the door of the court I encountered Father
Daniel.During his lifetime no such
crime had been perpetrated in the village, and his only comfort was
that the actors in it were strangers.But that did not lessen his
horror of the deed, and his large heart overflowed with pity both for
the guilty man and the victim.he said, in a voice broken by tears.Thrust before the Eternal Presence weighed down by sin!I
have been praying by his side for mercy, and for mercy upon his
murderer.I could not sympathise with his sentiments, and I told him so sternly.He made no attempt to convert me to his views, but simply said, "All
men should pray that they may never be tempted."And so he left me, and turned in the direction of his little chapel to
offer up prayers for the dead and the living sinners.Doctor Louis was with the magistrate; they had been discussing
theories, and had heard from the landlord of the Three Black Crows my
own ideas of the movements of the strangers on the previous night."In certain respects you may be right in your speculations," the
magistrate said; "but on one important point you are in error.""I have already discovered," I said, "that my theory is wrong, and not
in accordance with fact; but we will speak of that presently."As to the weapon with which the murder was done," replied the
magistrate, a shrewd man, whose judicial perceptions fitted him for a
larger sphere of duties than he was called upon to perform in Nerac."A club of some sort," said the magistrate, "with which the dead man
was suddenly attacked from behind.""No, but a search is being made for it and also for the murderer."There is no shadow of doubt that the
missing man is guilty.""There can be none," said the magistrate."And yet," urged Doctor Louis, in a gentle tone, "to condemn a man
unheard is repugnant to justice.""There are circumstances," said the magistrate, "which point so surely
to guilt that it would be inimical to justice to dispute them.By the
way," he continued, addressing me, "did not the landlord of the Three
Black Crows mention something to the effect that you were at his inn
last night after you left Dr.Louis's house, and that you and he had a
conversation respecting the strangers, who were at that time in the
same room as yourselves?""If he did," I said, "he stated what is correct.I was there, and saw
the strangers, of whom the landlord entertained suspicions which have
been proved to be well founded.""Then you will be able to identify the body, already," added the
magistrate, "identified by the landlord.Confirmatory evidence
strengthens a case.""I shall be able to identify it," I said.We went to the inner room, and I saw at a glance that it was one of
the strangers who had spent the evening at the Three Black Crows, and
whom I had afterwards watched and followed."The man who has escaped," I observed, "was hump backed.""That tallies with the landlord's statement," said the magistrate."I have something to relate," I said, upon our return to the court,
"of my own movements last night after I quitted the inn."I then gave the magistrate and Doctor Louis a circumstantial account
of my movements, without, however, entering into a description of my
thoughts, only in so far as they affected my determination to protect
the doctor and his family from evil designs.They listened with great interest, and Doctor Louis pressed my hand.He understood and approved of the solicitude I had experienced for the
safety of his household; it was a guarantee that I would watch over
his daughter with love and firmness and protect her from harm."But you ran a great risk, Gabriel," he said affectionately."I did not consider that," I said.The magistrate looked on and smiled; a father himself, he divined the
undivulged ties by which I and Doctor Louis were bound."At what time," he asked, "do you say you left the rogues asleep in
the woods?""It was twenty minutes to eleven," I replied, "and at eleven o'clock I
reached my house, and was received by Martin Hartog's daughter.Hartog
was absent, on business his daughter said, and while we were talking,
and I was taking the keys from her hands, Hartog came home, and
accompanied me to my bedroom.""Were you at all disturbed in your mind for the safety of your friends
in consequence of what had passed?"The men I left slumbering in the woods appeared to
me to be but ordinary tramps, without any special evil intent, and I
was satisfied and relieved.I could not have slept else; it is seldom
that I have enjoyed a better night."May not their slumbers have been feigned?"They were in a profound sleep; I made sure of that.No,
I could not have been mistaken.""It is strange," mused Doctor Louis, "how guilt can sleep, and can
forget the present and the future!"I then entered into an account of the inspection I had made of the
path from the gate to the window; it was the magistrate's opinion,
from the position in which the body was found, that there had been no
struggle between the two men, and here he and I were in agreement.What I now narrated materially weakened his opinion, as it had
materially weakened mine, and he was greatly perplexed.He was annoyed
also that the signs I had discovered, which confirmed the notion that
a struggle must have taken place, had escaped the attention of his
assistants.He himself had made but a cursory examination of the
grounds, his presence being necessary in the court to take the
evidence of witnesses, to receive reports, and to issue instructions."There are so many things to be considered," said Doctor Louis, "in a
case like this, resting as it does at present entirely upon
circumstantial evidence, that it is scarcely possible some should not
be lost sight of.Often those that are omitted are of greater weight
than those which are argued out laboriously and with infinite
patience.Justice is blind, but the law must be Argus-eyed.You
believe, Gabriel, that there must have been a struggle in my garden?""Such is now my belief," I replied."Such signs as you have brought before our notice," continued the
doctor, "are to you an indication that the man who escaped must have
met with severe treatment?""Therefore, that the struggle was a violent one?""Such a struggle could not have taken place without considerable
disarrangement about the spot in which it occurred.On an even
pavement you would not look for any displacement of the stones; the
utmost you could hope to discover would be the scratches made by iron
heels.But the path from the gate of my house to the back garden, and
all the walking spaces in the garden itself, are formed of loose
stones and gravel.No such struggle could take place there without
conspicuous displacement of the materials of which the ground is
composed.If it took place amongst the flowers, the beds would bear
evidence."Then did you observe such a disarrangement of the stones and gravel
as I consider would be necessary evidence of the struggle in which you
suppose these men to have been engaged?"I was compelled to admit--but I admitted it grudgingly and
reluctantly--that such a disarrangement had not come within my
observation."That is partially destructive of your theory," pursued the doctor."There is still something further of moment which I consider it my duty
to say.You are a sound sleeper ordinarily, and last night you slept
more soundly than usual.I, unfortunately, am a light sleeper, and it
is really a fact that last night I slept more lightly than usual.I
think, Gabriel, you were to some extent the cause of this.I am
affected by changes in my domestic arrangements; during many pleasant
weeks you have resided in our house, and last night was the first, for
a long time past, that you slept away from us.It had an influence
upon me; then, apart from your absence, I was thinking a great deal of
you."(Here I observed the magistrate smile again, a fatherly
benignant smile.)"As a rule I am awakened by the least noise--the
dripping of water, the fall of an inconsiderable object, the mewing of
a cat, the barking of a dog.Now, last night I was not disturbed,
unusually wakeful as I was.The wonder is that I was not aroused by
the boring of the hole in the shutter; the unfortunate wretch must
have used his gimlet very softly and warily, and under any
circumstances the sound produced by such a tool is of a light nature.But had any desperate struggle taken place in the garden it would have
aroused me to a certainty, and I should have hastened down to
ascertain the cause."Then," said the magistrate, "how do you account for the injuries the
man who escaped must have undoubtedly received?"The words were barely uttered when we all started to our feet.There
was a great scuffling outside, and cries and loud voices.The door was
pushed open and half-a-dozen men rushed into the room, guarding one
whose arms were bound by ropes.He was in a dreadful condition, and so
weak that, without support, he could not have kept his feet.I
recognised him instantly; he was the hump backed man I had seen in the
Three Black Crows.He lifted his eyes and they fell on the magistrate; from him they
wandered to Doctor Louis; from him they wandered to me.I was gazing
steadfastly and sternly upon him, and as his eyes met mine his head
drooped to his breast and hung there, while a strong shuddering ran
through him.The examination of the prisoner by the magistrate lasted but a very
short time, for the reason that no replies of any kind could be
obtained to the questions put to him.He maintained a dogged silence,
and although the magistrate impressed upon him that this silence was
in itself a strong proof of his guilt, and that if he had anything to
say in his defence it would be to his advantage to say it at once, not
a word could be extracted from him, and he was taken to his cell,
instructions being given that he should not be unbound and that a
strict watch should be kept over him.While the unsuccessful
examination was proceeding I observed the man two or three times raise
his eyes furtively to mine, or rather endeavour to raise them, for he
could not, for the hundredth part of a second, meet my stern gaze, and
each time he made the attempt it ended in his drooping his head with a
shudder.On other occasions I observed his eyes wandering round the
room in a wild, disordered way, and these proceedings, which to my
mind were the result of a low, premeditated cunning, led me to the
conclusion that he wished to convey the impression that he was not in
his right senses, and therefore not entirely responsible for his
crime.When the monster was taken away I spoke of this, and the
magistrate fell in with my views, and said that the assumption of
pretended insanity was not an uncommon trick on the part of criminals.I then asked him and Doctor Louis whether they would accompany me in a
search for the weapon with which the dreadful deed was committed (for
none had been found on the prisoner), and in a further examination of
the ground the man had traversed after he had killed his comrade in
guilt.Doctor Louis expressed his willingness, but the magistrate said
he had certain duties to attend to which would occupy him half an hour
or so, and that he would join us later on.So Doctor Louis and I
departed alone to continue the investigation I had already commenced.We began at the window at the back of the doctor's house, and I again
propounded to Doctor Louis my theory of the course of events, to which
he listened attentively, but was no more convinced than he had been
before that a struggle had taken place."But," he said, "whether a struggle for life did or did not take place
there is not the slightest doubt of the man's guilt, I have always
viewed circumstantial evidence with the greatest suspicion, but in
this instance I should have no hesitation, were I the monster's judge,
to mete out to him the punishment for his crime."Shortly afterwards we were joined by the magistrate who had news to
communicate to us."I have had," he said, "another interview with the prisoner, and have
succeeded in unlocking his tongue.I went to his cell, unaccompanied,
and again questioned him.To my surprise he asked me if I was alone.I
moved back a pace or two, having the idea that he had managed to
loosen the ropes by which he was bound, and that he wished to know if
I was alone for the purpose of attacking me.In a moment, however, the
fear was dispelled, for I saw that his arms were tightly and closely
bound to his side, and that it was out of his power to injure me.He
repeated his question, and I answered that I was quite alone, and that
his question was a foolish one, for he had the evidence of his senses
to convince him.He shook his head at this, and said in a strange
voice that the evidence of his senses was sufficient in the case of
men and women, but not in the case of spirits and demons.I smiled
inwardly at this--for it does not do for a magistrate to allow a
prisoner from whom he wishes to extract evidence to detect any signs
of levity in his judge--and I thought of the view you had presented to
me that the man wished to convey an impression that he was a madman,
in order to escape to some extent the consequences of the crime he had
committed.'Put spirits and demons,' I said to him, 'out of the
question.If you have anything to say or confess, speak at once; and
if you wish to convince yourself that there are no witnesses either in
this cell--though that is plainly evident--or outside, here is the
proof.'I threw open the door, and showed him that no one was
listening to our speech.'I cannot put spirits or demons out of the
question,' he said, 'because I am haunted by one, who has brought me
to this.'He looked down at his ropes and imprisoned limbs.'Are you
guilty or not guilty?''I am not guilty,' he replied; 'I did
not kill him.''Yes,' he replied, 'he is
murdered.''If you did not kill him,' I continued, 'who did?''A demon killed him,' he said, 'and would have
killed me, if I had not fled and played him a trick.'I gazed at him
in thought, wondering whether he had the slightest hope that he was
imposing upon me by his lame attempt at being out of his senses.'But,' I
said, and I admit that my tone was somewhat bantering, 'demons are
more powerful than mortals.''That is where it is,' he said; 'that is
why I am here.''You are a clumsy scoundrel,' I said, 'and I will
prove it to you; then you may be induced to speak the truth--in
which,' I added, 'lies your only hope of a mitigation of punishment.Not that I hold out to you any such hope; but if you can establish,
when you are ready to confess, that what you did was done in
self-defence, it will be a point in your favour.''I cannot confess,'
he said, 'to a crime which I did not commit.I am a clumsy scoundrel
perhaps, but not in the way you mean.'You
say,' I began, 'that a demon killed your comrade.''And,' I continued, 'that he would have killed you if
you had not fled from him.''But,' I
said, 'demons are more powerful than men.Of what avail would have
been your flight?Men can only walk or run; demons can fly.The demon
you have invented could have easily overtaken you and finished you as
you say he finished the man you murdered.'He was a little staggered
at this, and I saw him pondering over it.'It isn't for me,' he said
presently, 'to pretend to know why he did not suspect the trick I
played him; he could have killed me if he wanted.'There again,' I said, wondering that
there should be in the world men with such a low order of
intelligence, 'you heard him pursuing you.Demons glide noiselessly
along.It is impossible you could have heard this one.'I have invented none,' he persisted
doggedly, and repeated, 'I have spoken the truth.'As I could get
nothing further out of him than a determined adherence to his
ridiculous defence, I left him.""Do you think," asked Doctor Louis, "that he has any, even the
remotest belief in the story?"I cannot believe it," replied the magistrate, "and yet I confess to
being slightly puzzled.There was an air of sincerity about him which
might be to his advantage had he to deal with judges who were ignorant
of the cunning of criminals.""Which means," said Doctor Louis, "that it is really not impossible
that the man's mind is diseased.""No," said the magistrate, in a positive tone, "I cannot for a moment
admit it.A tale in which a spirit or a demon is the principal actor!At that moment I made a discovery; I drew from the midst of a bush a
stick, one end of which was stained with blood.From its position it
seemed as if it had been thrown hastily away; there had certainly been
no attempt at concealment."Here is the weapon," I cried, "with which the deed was done!"The magistrate took it immediately from my hand, and examined it."Here," I said, pointing downwards, "is the direct line of flight
taken by the prisoner, and he must have flung the stick away in terror
as he ran.""It is an improvised weapon," said the magistrate, "cut but lately
from a tree, and fashioned so as to fit the hand and be used with
effect."I, in my turn, then examined the weapon, and was struck by its
resemblance to the branch I had myself cut the previous night during
the watch I kept upon the ruffians.I spoke of the resemblance, and
said that it looked to me as if it were the self-same stick I had
shaped with my knife."Do you remember," asked the magistrate, "what you did with it after
your suspicions were allayed?""No," I replied, "I have not the slightest remembrance what I did with
it.I could not have carried it home with me, or I should have seen it
this morning before I left my house.I have no doubt that, after my
mind was at ease as to the intentions of the ruffians, I flung it
aside into the woods, having no further use for it.When the men set
out to perpetrate the robbery they must have stumbled upon the branch,
and, appreciating the pains I had bestowed upon it, took it with them.There appears to be no other solution to their possession of it.""It is the only solution," said the magistrate."So that," I said with a sudden thrill of horror, "I am indirectly
responsible for the direction of the tragedy, and should have been
responsible had they used the weapon against those I love!"We have all happily been spared,
Gabriel," he said."It is only the guilty who have suffered."We continued our search for some time, without meeting with any
further evidence, and I spent the evening with Doctor Louis's family,
and was deeply grateful that Providence had frustrated the villainous
schemes of the wretches who had conspired against them.On this
evening Lauretta and I seemed to be drawn closer to each other, and
once, when I held her hand in mine for a moment or two (it was done
unconsciously), and her father's eyes were upon us, I was satisfied
that he did not deem it a breach of the obligation into which we had
entered with respect to my love for his daughter.Indeed it was not
possible that all manifestations of a love so profound and absorbing
as mine should be successfully kept out of sight; it would have been
contrary to nature.I slept that night in Doctor Louis's house, and the next morning
Lauretta and Lauretta's mother said that they had experienced a
feeling of security because of my presence.At noon I was on my way to the magistrate's office.My purpose was to obtain, by the magistrate's permission, an interview
with the prisoner.His account of the man's sincere or pretended
belief in spirits and demons had deeply interested me, and I wished to
have some conversation with him respecting this particular adventure
which had ended in murder.I obtained without difficulty the
permission I sought.I asked if the prisoner had made any further
admissions or confession, and the magistrate answered no, and that the
man persisted in a sullen adherence to the tale he had invented in his
own defence."I saw him this morning," the magistrate said, "and interrogated him
with severity, to no effect.He continues to declare himself to be
innocent, and reiterates his fable of the demon.""Have you asked him," I inquired, "to give you an account of all that
transpired within his knowledge from the moment he entered Nerac until
the moment he was arrested?""No," said the magistrate, "it did not occur to me to demand of him so
close a description of his movements; and I doubt whether I should
have been able to drag it from him.The truth he will not tell, and
his invention is not strong enough to go into minute details.He is
conscious of this, conscious that I should trip him up again and again
on minor points which would be fatal to him, and his cunning nature
warns him not to thrust his head into the trap.He belongs to the
lowest order of criminals."My idea was to obtain from the prisoner just such a circumstantial
account of his movements as I thought it likely the magistrate would
have extracted from him; and I felt that I had the power to succeed
where the magistrate had failed.I was taken into the man's cell, and left there without a word.He was
still bound; his brute face was even more brute and haggard than
before, his hair was matted, his eyes had a look in them of mingled
terror and ferocity.He spoke no word, but he raised his head and
lowered it again when the door of the cell was closed behind me.But I had to repeat the question twice
before he answered me."Why did you not reply to me at once?"But to this question, although
I repeated it also twice, he made no response."It is useless," I said sternly, "to attempt evasion with me, or to
think that I will be content with silence.I have come here to obtain
a confession from you--a true confession, Pierre--and I will force it
from you, if you do not give it willingly."I understand you," he said, keeping his face averted from me, "but I
will not speak.""Because you know all; because you are only playing with me; because
you have a design against me."His words astonished me, and made me more determined to carry out my
intention.He had made it clear to me that there was something hidden
in his mind, and I was resolved to get at it."What design can I have against you," I said, "of which you need be
afraid?You are in sufficient peril already, and there is no hope for
you.Soon you
will be as dead as the man you murdered.""I did not murder him," was the strange reply, "and you know it.""You are playing the same trick upon me that you
played upon your judge.It was unsuccessful with him; it will be as
unsuccessful with me.What further danger can threaten you
than the danger, the certain, positive danger, in which you now stand?"My body is, perhaps," he muttered, "but not my soul.""Oh," I said, in a tone of contempt, "you believe in a soul.""Yes," he replied, "do not you?"Not out of my fears, but out
of my hopes.""I have no hopes and no fears," he said."I have done wrong, but not
the wrong with which I am charged."His response to this was to hide his head closer on his breast, to
make an even stronger endeavour to avoid my glance."When I next command you," I said, "you will obey.Believing that you possess one, what worse peril can threaten it than
the pass to which you have brought it by your crime."And still he doggedly repeated, "I have committed no crime.""Because you are here to tempt me, to ensnare me.I strode to his side, and with my strong hand on his shoulder, forced
him to raise his head, forced him to look me straight in the face.His
eyes wavered for a few moments, shifted as though they would escape my
compelling power, and finally became fixed on mine.The will in me was strong, and produced its effects on the
weaker mind.Gradually what brilliancy there was in his eyes became
dimmed, and drew but a reflected, shadowy light from mine.Thus we
remained face to face for four or five minutes, and then I spoke."Relate to me," I said, "all that you know from the time you and the
man who is dead conceived the idea of coming to Nerac up to the
present moment."We were poor, both of us," Pierre commenced, "and had been poor all
our lives.That would not have mattered had we been able to obtain
meat and wine.We were neither of us honest, and had
been in prison more than once for theft.We were never innocent when
we were convicted, although we swore we were.I got tired of it;
starvation is a poor game.I would have been contented with a little,
and so would he, but we could not make sure of that little.Nothing
else was left to us but to take what we wanted.The wild beasts do;
why should not we?But we were too well known in our village, some
sixty miles from Nerac, so, talking it over, we said we would come
here and try our luck.We had heard of Doctor Louis, and that he was a
rich man.He can spare what we want, we said; we will go and take.We
had no idea of blood; we only wanted money, to buy meat and wine with.So we started, with nothing in our pockets.On the first day we had a
slice of luck.We met a man and waylaid him, and took from him all the
money he had in his pockets.It was not much, but enough to carry us
to Nerac.We did not hurt the man; a
knock on the head did not take his senses from him, but brought him to
them; so, being convinced, he gave us what he had, and we departed on
our way.We were not fast walkers, and, besides, we did not know the
straightest road to Nerac, so we were four days on the journey.When
we entered the inn of the Three Black Crows we had just enough money
left to pay for a bottle of red wine.We called for it, and sat
drinking.While we were there a spirit entered in the shape of a man.This spirit, whom I did not then know to be a demon, sat talking with
the landlord of the Three Black Crows.He looked towards the place
where we were sitting, and I wondered whether he and the landlord were
talking of us; I could not tell, because what they said did not reach
my ears.He went away, and we went away, too, some time afterwards.We
wanted another bottle of red wine, but the landlord would not give it
to us without our paying for it, and we had no money; our pockets were
bare.Before we entered the Three Black Crows we had found out
Doctor Louis's house, and knew exactly how it was situated; there
would be no difficulty in finding it later on, despite the darkness.We had decided not to make the attempt until at least two hours past
midnight, but, for all that, when we left the inn we walked in the
direction of the doctor's house.I do not know if we should have
continued our way, because, although I saw nothing and heard nothing,
I had a fancy that we were being followed; I couldn't say by what, but
the idea was in my mind.So, talking quietly together, he and I
determined to turn back to some woods on the outskirts of Nerac which
we had passed through before we reached the village, and there to
sleep an hour or two till the time arrived to put our plan into
execution.Back we turned, and as we went there came a sign to me.I
don't know how; it was through the senses, for I don't remember
hearing anything that I could not put down to the wind.My mate heard
it too, and we stopped in fear.We stood quiet a long while, and
heard nothing.Then my mate said, 'It was the wind;' and we went on
till we came to the woods, which we entered.Down upon the ground we
threw ourselves, and in a minute my mate was asleep.Not so I; but I
pretended to be.I did not move;
I even breathed regularly to put it off the scent.Presently it
departed, and I opened my eyes; nothing was near us.Then, being tired
with the long day's walk, and knowing that there was work before us
which would be better done after a little rest, I fell asleep myself.We both slept, I can't say how long, but from the appearance of the
night I judged till about the time we had resolved to do our work.I
woke first, and awoke my mate, and off we set to the doctor's house.We reached it in less than an hour, and nothing disturbed us on the
way.That made me think that I had been deceived, and that my senses
had been playing tricks with me.I told my mate of my fears, and he
laughed at me, and I laughed, too, glad to be relieved.We walked
round the doctor's house, to decide where we should commence.The
front of it faces the road, and we thought that too dangerous, so we
made our way to the back, and, talking in whispers, settled to bore a
hole through the shutters there.We were very quiet; no fear of our
being heard.The hole being bored, it was easy to cut away wood enough
to enable us to open the window and make our way into the house.We
did not intend violence, that is, not more than was necessary for our
safety.We had talked it over, and had decided that no blood was to be
shed.Our plan was to gag and tie
up any one who interfered with us.My mate and I had had no quarrel;
we were faithful partners; and I had no other thought than to remain
true to him as he had no other thought than to remain true to me.Share and share alike--that was what we both intended.So he worked
away at the shutter, while I looked on.A blow came,
from the air it seemed, and down fell my mate, struck dead!He did not
move; he did not speak; he died, unshriven.I looked down, dazed, when
I heard a swishing sound in the air behind me, as though a great club
was making a circle and about to fall upon my head.It was all in a
minute, and I turned and saw the demon.I
slanted my body aside, and the club, instead of falling upon my head,
fell upon my shoulder.I ran for my life, and down came another blow,
on my head this time, but it did not kill me.I raced like a madman,
tearing at the bushes, and the demon after me.I was struck again and
again, but not killed.Wounded and bleeding, I continued my flight,
till flat I fell like a log.Not because all my strength was gone; no,
there was still a little left; but I showed myself more cunning than
the demon, for down I went as if I was dead, and he left me, thinking
me so.Then, when he was gone, I opened my eyes, and managed to drag
myself away to the place where I was found yesterday more dead than
alive.I did not kill my mate; I never raised my hand against him.What I have said is the truth, as I hope for mercy in the next world,
if I don't get it in this!"This was the incredible story related to me by the villain who had
threatened the life of the woman I loved; for he did not deceive me;
murder was in his heart, and his low cunning only served to show him
in a blacker light.I
released him from the spell I had cast upon him, and he stood before
me, shaking and trembling, with a look in his eyes as though he had
just been awakened from sleep."You have confessed all," I said, meeting cunning with cunning.Then I told him that he had made a full confession of his crime, and
in the telling expounded my own theory, as if it had come from his
lips, of the thoughts which led to it, and of its final committal--my
hope being that he would even now admit that he was the murderer."If I have said as much," he said, "it is you who have driven me to
it, and it is you who have come here to set a snare for my
destruction.But it is not possible, because what you have told me is
false from beginning to end."So I left him, amazed at his dogged, determined obstinacy, which I
knew would not avail him.I have been reading over the record I have written of my life, which
has been made with care and a strict adherence to the truth.I am at
the present hour sitting alone in the house I have taken and
furnished, and to which I hope shortly to bring my beloved Lauretta as
my wife.The writing of this record from time to time has grown into a
kind of habit with me, and there are occasions in which I have been
greatly interested in it myself.Never until this night have I read
the record from beginning to end, and I have come to a resolution to
discontinue it.My reason is a sufficient one, and as it concerns no
man else, no man can dispute my right to make it.My resolution is, after to-morrow, to allow my new life, soon to
commence, to flow on uninterruptedly without burdening myself with the
labour of putting into writing the happy experiences awaiting me.I
shall be no longer alone; Lauretta will be by my side; I should
begrudge the hours which deprived me of her society.I must have no secrets from her; and much that here is
recorded should properly be read by no eye than mine.Lauretta's
nature is so gentle, her soul so pure, that it would distress her to
read these pages.I recognise a certain morbid vein
in myself which the continuing of this record might magnify into a
disease.It presents itself to me in the light of guarding myself
against myself, by adopting wise measures to foster cheerfulness.That
my nature is more melancholy than cheerful is doubtless to be ascribed
to the circumstances of my child-life, which was entirely devoid of
light and gaiety.This must not be in the future; I have a battle to
fight, and I shall conquer because Lauretta's happiness is on the
issue.It will, however, be as well to make the record complete in a certain
sense, and I shall therefore take note of certain things which have
occurred since my conversation with Pierre in his cell.That done, I
shall put these papers aside in a secret place, and shall endeavour to
forget them.My first thought was to destroy the record, but I was
influenced in the contrary direction by the fact that my first meeting
with Lauretta and the growth of my love for her are described in it.First impressions jotted down at the time of their occurrence have a
freshness about them which can never be imparted by the aid of memory,
and it may afford me pleasure in the future to live over again,
through these pages, the sweet days of my early intimacy with my
beloved girl.Then there is the strange story of Kristel and Silvain,
which undoubtedly is worth preserving.First, to get rid of the miserable affair of the attempt to rob Doctor
Louis's house.Pierre was tried and convicted, and has paid the
penalty of his crime.His belief in the possession of a soul could
not, after all, have had in it the spirit of sincerity; it must have
been vaunted merely in pursuance of his cunning endeavours to escape
his just punishment; otherwise he would have confessed before he died.Father Daniel, the good priest, did all he could to bring the man to
repentance, but to the last he insisted that he was innocent.It was
strange to me to hear Father Daniel express himself sympathetically
towards the criminal."He laboured, up to the supreme moment," said the good priest, in a
compassionate tone, "under the singular hallucination that he was
going before his Maker guiltless of the shedding of blood.So fervent
and apparently sincere were his protestations that I could not help
being shaken in my belief that he was guilty.""Not in the sense," said Father Daniel, "that the unhappy man would
have had me believe.Reason rejects his story as something altogether
too incredulous; and yet I pity him."I did not prolong the discussion with the good priest; it would have
been useless, and, to Father Daniel, painful.We looked at the matter
from widely different standpoints.Intolerance warps the judgment; no
less does such a life as Father Daniel has lived, for ever seeking to
find excuses for error and crime, for ever seeking to palliate a man's
misdeeds.Sweetness of disposition, carried to extremes, may
degenerate into positive mental feebleness; to my mind this is the
case with Father Daniel.He is not the kind who, in serious matters,
can be depended upon for a just estimate of human affairs.Eric and Emilius, after a longer delay than Doctor Louis anticipated,
have taken up their residence in Nerac.They paid two short visits to
the village, and I was in hopes each time upon their departure that
they had relinquished their intention of living in Nerac.I did not
give expression to my wish, for I knew it was not shared by any member
of Doctor Louis's family.It is useless to disguise that I dislike them, and that there exists
between us a certain antipathy.To be just, this appears to be more on
my side than on theirs, and it is not in my disfavour that the
feelings I entertain are nearer the surface.Doctor Louis and the
ladies entertain a high opinion of them; I do not; and I have already
some reason for looking upon them with a suspicious eye.When we were first introduced it was natural that I should regard them
with interest, an interest which sprang from the story of their
father's fateful life.They bear a wonderful resemblance to each other
they are both fair, with tawny beards, which it appears to me they
take a pride in shaping and trimming alike; their eyes are blue, and
they are of exactly the same height.Undoubtedly handsome men, having
in that respect the advantage of me, who, in point of attractive
looks, cannot compare with them.They seem to be devotedly attached to
each other, but this may or may not be.So were Silvain and Kristel
until a woman stepped between them and changed their love to hate.Before I came into personal relationship with Eric and Emilius I made
up my mind to distrust appearances and to seek for evidence upon which
to form an independent judgment.Some such evidence has already come
to me, and I shall secretly follow it up.They are on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with Doctor Louis
and his family, and both Lauretta and Lauretta's mother take pleasure
in their society; Doctor Louis, also, in a lesser degree.Women are
always more effusive than men.They are not aware of the relations which bind me to the village.That
they may have some suspicion of my feelings for Lauretta is more than
probable, for I have seen them look from her to me and then at each
other, and I have interpreted these looks.It is as if they said, "Why
is this stranger here?I have begged Doctor
Louis to allow me to speak openly to Lauretta, and he has consented to
shorten the period of silence to which I was pledged.I have his
permission to declare my love to his daughter to-morrow.There are no
doubts in my mind that she will accept me; but there _are_ doubts that
if I left it too late there would be danger that her love for me would
be weakened.Yes, although it is torture to me to admit it I cannot
rid myself of this impression.By these brothers, Eric and Emilius, and by means of misrepresentations
to my injury.I have no positive data to go upon, but I am convinced
that they have an aversion towards me, and that they are in their hearts
jealous of me.The doctor is blind to their true character; he believes
them to be generous and noble-minded, men of rectitude and high
principle.I have the evidence of my senses in proof
of it.So much have I been disturbed and unhinged by my feelings towards
these brothers--feelings which I have but imperfectly expressed--that
latterly I have frequently been unable to sleep.Impossible to lie
abed and toss about for hours in an agony of unrest; therefore I chose
the lesser evil, and resumed the nocturnal wanderings which was my
habit in Rosemullion before the death of my parents.These nightly
rambles have been taken in secret, as in the days of my boyhood, and I
mused and spoke aloud as was my custom during that period of my life.But I had new objects to occupy me now--the home in which I hoped to
enjoy a heaven of happiness, with Lauretta its guiding star, and all
the bright anticipations of the future.I strove to confine myself to
these dreams, which filled my soul with joy, but there came to me
always the figures of Eric and Emilius, dark shadows to threaten my
promised happiness.Last week it was, on a night in which I felt that sleep would not be
mine if I sought my couch; therefore, earlier than usual--it was
barely eleven o'clock--I left the house, and went into the woods.Martin Hartog and his fair daughter were in the habit of retiring
early and rising with the sun, and I stole quietly away unobserved.At
twelve o'clock I turned homewards, and when I was about a hundred
yards from my house I was surprised to hear a low murmur of voices
within a short distance of me.Since the night on which I visited the
Three Black Crows and saw the two strangers there who had come to
Nerac with evil intent, I had become very watchful, and now these
voices speaking at such an untimely hour thoroughly aroused me.I
stepped quietly in their direction, so quietly that I knew I could not
be heard, and presently I saw standing at a distance of ten or twelve
yards the figures of a man and a woman.The man was Emilius, the woman
Martin Hartog's daughter.Although I had heard their voices before I reached the spot upon which
I stood when I recognised their forms, I could not even now determine
what they said, they spoke in such low tones.So I stood still and
watched them and kept myself from their sight.I may say honestly that
I should not have been guilty of the meanness had it not been that I
entertain an unconquerable aversion against Eric and Emilius.I was
sorry to see Martin Hartog's daughter holding a secret interview with
a man at midnight, for the girl had inspired me with a respect of
which I now knew she was unworthy; but I cannot aver that I was sorry
to see Emilius in such a position, for it was an index to his
character and a justification of the unfavourable opinion I had formed
of him and Eric.Alike as they were in physical presentment, I had no
doubt that their moral natures bore the same kind of resemblance.Libertines both of them, ready for any low intrigue, and holding in
light regard a woman's good name and fame.Truly the picture before me
showed clearly the stuff of which these brothers are made.If they
hold one woman's good name so lightly, they hold all women so.Fit
associates, indeed, for a family so pure and stainless as Doctor
Louis's!This was no chance meeting--how was that possible at such an hour?Theirs was no new acquaintanceship; it must have
lasted already some time.The very secrecy of the interview was in
itself a condemnation.Should I make Doctor Louis acquainted with the true character of the
brothers who held so high a place in his esteem?This was the question
that occurred to me as I gazed upon Emilius and Martin Hartog's
daughter, and I soon answered it in the negative.Doctor Louis was a
man of settled convictions, hard to convince, hard to turn.His first
impulse, upon which he would act, would be to go straight to Emilius,
and enlighten him upon the discovery I had made.Why, then,
Emilius would invent some tale which it would not be hard to believe,
and make light of a matter I deemed so serious.I should be placed in
the position of an eavesdropper, as a man setting sly watches upon
others to whom, from causeless grounds, I had taken a dislike.Whatever the result one thing was
certain--that I was a person capable not only of unreasonable
antipathies but of small meannesses to which a gentleman would not
descend.The love which Doctor Louis bore to Silvain, and which he had
transferred to Silvain's children, was not to be easily turned; and at
the best I should be introducing doubts into his mind which would
reflect upon myself because of the part of spy I had played.No; I
decided for the present at least, to keep  the knowledge to myself.As to Martin Hartog, though I could not help feeling pity for him, it
was for him, not me, to look after his daughter.From a general point
of view these affairs were common enough.I seemed to see now in a clearer light the kind of man Silvain
was--one who would set himself deliberately to deceive where most he
was trusted.Honour, fair dealing, brotherly love, were as nought in
his eyes where a woman was concerned, and he had transmitted these
qualities to Eric and Emilius.My sympathy for Kristel was deepened by
what I was gazing on; more than ever was I convinced of the justice of
the revenge he took upon the brother who had betrayed him.These were the thoughts which passed through my mind while Emilius and
Martin Hartog's daughter stood conversing.Presently they strolled
towards me, and I shrank back in fear of being discovered.This
involuntary action on my part, being an accentuation of the meanness
of which I was guilty, confirmed me in the resolution at which I had
arrived to say nothing of my discovery to Doctor Louis.They passed me in silence, walking in the direction of my house.I did
not follow them, and did not return home for another hour.How shall I describe the occurrences of this day, the most memorable
and eventful in my life?I am
overwhelmed at the happiness which is within my grasp.As I walked
home from Doctor Louis's house through the darkness a spirit walked by
my side, illumining the gloom and filling my heart with gladness.At one o'clock I presented myself at Doctor Louis's house.He met me
at the door, expecting me, and asked me to come with him to a little
room he uses as a study.His face was
grave, and but for its kindly expression I should have feared it was
his intention to revoke the permission he had given me to speak to his
daughter on this day of the deep, the inextinguishable love I bear for
her.He motioned me to a chair, and I seated myself and waited for him
to speak."This hour," he said, "is to me most solemn.""And to me, sir," I responded."It should be," he said, "to you perhaps, more than to me; but we are
inclined ever to take the selfish view.I have been awake very nearly
the whole of the night, and so has my wife.Our conversation--well,
you can guess the object of it.""Yes, Lauretta, our only child, whom you are about to take from us."I
trembled with joy, his words betokening a certainty that Lauretta
loved me, an assurance I had yet to receive from her own sweet lips."My wife and I," he continued, "have been living over again the life
of our dear one, and the perfect happiness we have drawn from her.I
am not ashamed to say that we have committed some weaknesses during
these last few hours, weaknesses springing from our affection for our
Home Rose.In the future some such experience may be yours, and then
you will know--which now is hidden from you--what parents feel who are
asked to give their one ewe lamb into the care of a stranger.""There is no reason for alarm, Gabriel," he said, "because I
have used a true word.Until a few short months ago you were really a
stranger to us.""That has not been against me, sir," I said, "and is not, I trust.""There is no such thought in my mind, Gabriel.There is nothing
against you except--except," he repeated, with a little pitiful smile,
"that you are about to take from us our most precious possession.Until to-day our dear child was wholly and solely ours; and not only
herself, but her past was ours, her past, which has been to us a
garden of joy.Henceforth her heart will be divided, and you will have
the larger share.That is a great deal to think of, and we have
thought of it, my wife and I, and talked of it nearly all the night.Certain treasures," he said, and again the pitiful smile came on his
lips, "which in the eyes of other men and women are valueless, still
are ours."He opened a drawer, and gazed with loving eyes upon its
contents."Such as a little pair of shoes, a flower or two, a lock of
her bright hair."I asked, profoundly touched by the loving accents
of his voice."Surely," he replied, and he passed over to me a lock of golden hair,
which I pressed to my lips."The little head was once covered with
these golden curls, and to us, her parents, they were as holy as they
would have been on the head of an angel.She was all that to us,
Gabriel.It is within the scope of human love to lift one's thoughts
to heaven and God; it is within its scope to make one truly fit for
the life to come.All things are not of the world worldly; it is a
grievous error to think so, and only sceptics can so believe.In the
kiss of baby lips, in the touch of little hands, in the myriad sweet
ways of childhood, lie the breath of a pure religion which God
receives because of its power to sanctify the lowest as well as the
highest of human lives.It is good to think of that, and to feel that,
in the holiest forms of humanity, the poor stand as high as the rich.""Gabriel, it is an idle phrase
for a father holding the position towards you which I do at the
present moment, to say he has no fears for the happiness of his only
child.""If you have any, sir," I said, "question me, and let me endeavour to
set your mind at ease.In one respect I can do so with solemn
earnestness.If it be my happy lot to win your daughter, her welfare,
her honour, her peace of mind, shall be the care of my life.I love Lauretta with a pure heart;
no other woman has ever possessed my love; to no other woman have I
been drawn; nor is it possible that I could be.She is to me part of
my spiritual life.I am not as other men, in the ordinary acceptation.In my childhood's life there was but little joy, and the common
pleasures of childhood were not mine.From almost my earliest
remembrances there was but little light in my parents' house, and in
looking back upon it I can scarcely call it a home.The fault was not
mine, as you will admit.May I claim some small merit--not of my own
purposed earning, but because it was in me, for which I may have
reason to be grateful--from the fact that the circumstances of my
early life did not corrupt me, did not drive me to a searching for low
pleasures, and did not debase me?It seemed to me, sir, that I was
ever seeking for something in the heights and not in the depths.Books
and study were my comforters, and I derived real pleasures from them.They served to satisfy a want, and, although I contracted a melancholy
mood, I was not unhappy.I know that this mood is in me, but when I
think of Lauretta it is dispelled.I seem to hear the singing of
birds, to see flowers around me, to bathe in sunshine.Perhaps it
springs from the fervour of my love for her; but a kind of belief is
mine that I have been drawn hither to her, that my way of life was
measured to her heart."You have said much," said Doctor Louis, "to comfort and assure me,
and have, without being asked, answered questions which were in my
mind.Do you remember a conversation you had with my wife in the first
days of your convalescence, commenced I think by you in saying that
the happiest dream of your life was drawing to a close?"Even in those early days I felt that I
loved her.""I understand that now," said Doctor Louis."My wife replied that life
must not be dreamt away, that it has duties.""My wife said that one's ease and pleasures are rewards, only
enjoyable when they have been worthily earned; and when you asked,
'Earned in what way?'she answered, 'In accomplishing one's work in
the world.'""Yes, sir, her words come back to me.""There is something more," said Doctor Louis, with sad sweetness,
"which I should not recall did I not hold duty before me as my chief
beacon.Inclination and selfish desire must often be sacrificed for
it.You will understand how sadly significant this is to me when I
recall what followed.Though, to be sure," he added, in a slightly
gayer tone, "we could visit you and our daughter, wherever your abode
happened to be.Continuing your conversation with my wife, you said,
'How to discover what one's work really is, and where it should be
properly performed?'My wife answered, 'In one's native land.'""Those were the words we spoke to one another, sir.""It was my wife who recalled them to me, and I wish you--in the event
of your hopes being realised--to bear them in mind.It would be
painful to me to see you lead an idle life, and it would be injurious
to you.This quiet village opens out no opportunities to you; it is
too narrow, too confined.I have found my place here as an active
worker, but I doubt if you would do so.""There is time to think of it, sir."And now, if you like, we will join my wife and
daughter.""Have you said anything to Lauretta, sir?"I thought it best, and so did her mother, that her heart should
be left to speak for itself."Lauretta's mother received me with tender, wistful solicitude, and I
observed nothing in Lauretta to denote that she had been prepared for
the declaration I had come to make.After lunch I proposed to Lauretta
to go out into the garden, and she turned to her mother and asked if
she would accompany us."No, my child," said the mother, "I have things in the house to attend
to."It was a lovely day, and Lauretta had thrown a light lace scarf over
her head.She was in gay spirits, not boisterous, for she is ever
gentle, and she endeavoured to entertain me with innocent prattle, to
which I found it difficult to respond.In a little while this forced
itself upon her observation, and she asked me if I was not well."I am quite well, Lauretta," I replied."Then something has annoyed you," she said.No, I answered, nothing had annoyed me."But there _is_ something," she said."Yes," I said, "there _is_ something."We were standing by a rosebush, and I plucked one absently, and
absently plucked the leaves.She looked at me in silence for a moment
or two and said, "This is the first time I have ever seen you destroy
a flower.""I was not thinking of it," I said; and was about to throw it away
when an impulse, born purely of love for what was graceful and sweet,
restrained me, and I put it into my pocket.In this the most
impressive epoch in my life no sentiment but that of tenderness could
hold a place in my heart and mind."Lauretta," I said, taking her hand, which she left willingly in mine,
"will you listen to the story of my life?""You have already told me much," she said."You have heard only a part," I said, and I gently urged her to a
seat."I wish you to know all; I wish you to know me as I really am.""I know you as you really are," she said, and then a faint colour came
to her cheeks, and she trembled slightly, seeing a new meaning in my
earnest glances."Yes," she said, and gently withdrew her hand from mine.I told her all, withholding only from her those mysterious promptings
of my lonely hours which I knew would distress her, and to which I was
convinced, with her as my companion through life, there would be for
ever an end.Of even those promptings I gave her some insight, but so
toned down--for her sweet sake, not for mine--as to excite only her
sympathy.Apart from this, I was at sincere pains that she should see
my life as it had really been, a life stripped of the joys of
childhood; a life stripped of the light of home; a life dependent upon
itself for comfort and support.Then, unconsciously, and out of the
suffering of my soul--for as I spoke it seemed to me that a cruel
wrong had been perpetrated upon me in the past--I contrasted the young
life I had been condemned to live with that of a child who was blessed
with parents whose hearts were animated by a love the evidences of
which would endure all through his after life as a sweet and purifying
influence.The tears ran down her cheeks as I dwelt upon this part of
my story.Then I spoke of the happy chance which had conducted me to
her home, and of the happiness I had experienced in my association
with her and hers."Whatever fate may be mine," I said, "I shall never reflect upon these
experiences, I shall never think of your dear parents, without
gratitude and affection.Lauretta, it is with their permission I am
here now by your side.It is with their permission that I am opening
my heart to you.I love you, Lauretta,
and if you will bless me with your love, and place your hand in mine,
all my life shall be devoted to your happiness.You can bring a
blessing into my days; I will strive to bring a blessing into yours."My arm stole round her waist; her head drooped to my shoulder, so that
her face was hidden from my ardent gaze; the hand I clasped was not
withdrawn."Lauretta," I whispered, "say 'I love you, Gabriel.'""I love you, Gabriel," she whispered; and heaven itself opened out to
me.Half an hour later we went in to her mother, and the noble woman held
out her arms to her daughter.As the maiden nestled to her breast, she
said, holding out a hand to me, which I reverently kissed, "God in His
mercy keep guard over you!*   *   *   *   *

These are my last written words in the record I have kept.From this
day I commence a new life.IN WHICH THE SECRET OF THE INHERITANCE TRANSMITTED TO GABRIEL CAREW IS
REVEALED IN A SERIES OF LETTERS FROM ABRAHAM SANDIVAL, ESQ., ENGLAND,
TO HIS FRIEND, MAXIMILIAN GALLENGA, ESQ., CONTRA COSTA CO.,
CALIFORNIA.I.


My Dear Max,--For many months past you have complained that I have
been extremely reticent upon domestic matters, and that I have said
little or nothing concerning my son Reginald, who, since you quitted
the centres of European civilisation to bury yourself in a sparsely
populated Paradise, has grown from childhood to manhood.A ripe
manhood, my dear Max, such as I, his father, approve of, and to the
future development of which, now that a grave and strange crisis in
his life has come to a happy ending, I look forward with loving
interest.It is, I know, your affection for Reginald that causes you
to be anxious for news of him.Well do I remember when you informed me
of your fixed resolution to seek not only new scenes but new modes of
life, how earnestly you strove to prevail upon me to allow him to
accompany you."He is young and plastic," you said, "and I can train him to
happiness.The fewer the wants, the more contented the lot of man."You wished to educate Reginald according to the primitive views to
which you had become so strongly wedded, and you did your best to
convert me to them, saying, I remember, that I should doubtless suffer
in parting with Reginald, but that it was a father's duty to make
sacrifices for his children.My belief was, and
is, that man is born to progress, and that to go back into
primitiveness, to commence again, as it were, the history of the world
and mankind, as though we had been living in error through all the
centuries, is a folly.I did not apply this criticism to you; I
regarded your new departure not as a folly, but as a mistake.I doubt
even now whether it has made you happier than you were, and I fancy
I detect here and there in your letters a touch of sadness and
regret--of which perhaps you are unconscious--that you should have cut
yourself away from the busy life of multitudes of people.However, it
is not my purpose now to enlarge upon this theme.The history I am
about to relate is personal to myself and to Reginald, whose destiny
it has been to come into close contact with a family, the head of
which, Gabriel Carew, affords a psychological study as strange
probably as was ever presented to the judgment of mankind.There are various reasons for my undertaking a task which will occupy
a great deal of time and entail considerable labour.The labour will
be interesting to me, and its products no less interesting to you, who
were always fond of the mystical.I have leisure to apply myself to
it.Reginald is not at present with me; he has left me for a few weeks
upon a mission of sunshine.This will sound enigmatical to you, but
you must content yourself with the gradual and intelligible unfolding
of the wonderful story I am about to narrate.Like a skilful narrator
I shall not weaken the interest by giving information and presenting
pictures to you in the wrong places.The history is one which it is my
opinion should not be lost to the world; its phases are so remarkable
that it will open up a field of inquiry which may not be without
profitable results to those who study psychological mysteries.A few
years hence I should not be able to recall events in their logical
order; I therefore do so while I possess the power and while my memory
is clear with respect to them.You will soon discover that neither I nor Reginald is the principal
character in this drama of life.Gabriel Carew, the owner of an estate in the county of Kent, known as
Rosemullion.My labours will be thrown away unless you are prepared to read what I
shall write with unquestioning faith.I shall set down nothing but the
truth, and you must accept it without a thought of casting doubt upon
it.That you will wonder and be amazed is certain; it would, indeed,
be strange otherwise; for in all your varied experiences (you led a
busy and eventful life before you left us) you met with none so
singular and weird as the events which I am about to bring to your
knowledge.You must accept also--as the best and most suitable form
through which you will be made familiar not only with the personality
of Gabriel Carew, but with the mysterious incidents of his life--the
methods I shall adopt in the unfolding of my narrative.They are such
as are frequently adopted with success by writers of fiction, and as
my material is fact, I am justified in pressing it into my service.I
am aware that objection may be taken to it on the ground that I shall
be presenting you with conversations between persons of which I was
not a witness, but I do not see in what other way I could offer you an
intelligent and intelligible account of the circumstances of the
story.All that I can therefore do is to promise that I will keep a
strict curb upon my imagination and will not allow it to encroach upon
the domains of truth.With this necessary prelude I devote myself to
my task.Before, however, myself commencing the work there is something
essential for you to do.Accompanying my own manuscript is a packet,
carefully sealed and secured, on the outer sheet of which is written,
"Not to be disturbed or opened until instructions to do so are given
by Abraham Sandival to his friend Maximilian Gallenofa."The
precaution is sufficient to whet any man's curiosity, but is not taken
to that end.It is simply in pursuance of the plan I have designed, by
which you will become possessed of all the details and particulars for
the proper understanding of what I shall impart to you.The packet, my
dear Max, is neither more nor less than a life record made by Gabriel
Carew himself up to within a few months of his marriage, which took
place twenty years ago in the village of Nerac.The lady Gabriel Carew
married was the daughter of Doctor Louis, a gentleman of rare
acquirements, and distinguished both for his learning and benevolence.There is no evidence in the record as to whether its recital was
spread over a number of years, or was begun and finished within a few
months; but that matters little.It bears the impress of absolute
truth and candour, and apart from its startling revelations you will
recognise in it a picturesqueness of description hardly to be expected
from one who had not made a study of literature.Its perusal will
perplexedly stir your mind, and in the feelings it will excite towards
Gabriel Carew there will most likely be an element of pity, the reason
for which you will find it difficult to explain."Season your
admiration for a while;" before I am at the end of my task the riddle
will be solved.As I pen these words I can realise your perplexity during your perusal
of the record as to the manner in which my son Reginald came be
associated with so strange a man as the writer.But this is a world of
mystery, and we can never hope to find a key to its spiritual
workings.With respect to this particular mystery nothing shall be
hidden from you.You will learn how I came to be mixed up in it; you
will learn how vitally interwoven it threatened to be in Reginald's
life; you will learn how Gabriel Carew's manuscript fell into my
hands; and the mystery of his life will be revealed to you.Now, my dear Max, you can unfasten the packet, and read the record.I assume that you are now familiar with the story of Gabriel Carew's
life up to the point, or within a few months, of his marriage with
Lauretta, and that you have formed some opinion of the different
persons with whom he came in contact in Nerac.Outside Nerac there was
only one person who can be said to have been interested in his fate;
this was his mother's nurse, Mrs.Fortress, and you must be deeply
impressed by the part she played in the youthful life of Gabriel
Carew.Of her I shall have to speak in due course.I transport you in fancy to Nerac, my dear Max, where I have been not
very long ago, and where I conversed with old people who to this day
remember Gabriel Carew and his sweet wife Lauretta, whom he brought
with him to England some little time after their marriage.It is not
likely that the incidents in connection with Gabriel Carew and his
wife will be forgotten during this generation or the next in that
loveliest of villages.When you laid aside Carew's manuscript he had received the sanction of
Lauretta's mother to his engagement with the sweet maid, and the good
woman had given her children her blessing.Thereafter Gabriel Carew
wrote: "These are my last written words in the record I have kept.He kept his word with respect to
his resolve not to add another word to the record.He sealed it up and
deposited it in his desk; and it is my belief that from that day he
never read a line of its contents.We are, then, my dear Max, in Nerac, you and I in spirit, in the
holiday time of the open courtship of Gabriel Carew and Lauretta.Carew is occupying the house of which it was his intention to make
Lauretta the mistress, and there are residing in it, besides the
ordinary servants, Martin Hartog, the gardener, and his daughter, with
whom, from Carew's record, Emilius was supposed to be carrying on an
intrigue of a secret and discreditable nature.It is evident, from the
manner in which Carew referred to it, that he considered it
dishonourable.There remain to be mentioned, as characters in the drama then being
played, Doctor Louis, Eric, and Father Daniel.The crimes of the two ruffians who had attempted to enter Doctor
Louis's house remained for long fresh in the memories of the
villagers.They were both dead, one murdered, the other executed for a
deed of which only one person in Nerac had an uneasy sense of his
innocence--Father Daniel.The good priest, having received from the
unfortunate man a full account of his life from childhood, journeyed
shortly afterwards to the village in which he had been born and was
best known, for the purpose of making inquiries into its truth.He
found it verified in every particular, and he learnt, moreover, that
although the hunchback had been frequently in trouble, it was rather
from sheer wretchedness and poverty than from any natural brutality of
disposition that he had drifted into crime.It stood to his credit
that Father Daniel could trace to him no acts of cruel violence;
indeed, the priest succeeded in bringing to light two or three
circumstances in the hunchback's career which spoke well for his
humanity, one of them being that he was kind to his bedridden mother.Father Daniel returned to Nerac much shaken by the reflection that in
this man's case justice had been in error.But if this were so, if the
hunchback were innocent, upon whom to fix the guilt?A sadness weighed
upon the good priest's heart as he went about his daily duties, and
gazed upon his flock with an awful suspicion in his mind that there
was a murderer among them, for whose crime an innocent man had been
executed.The gloom of his early life, which threatened
to cast dark shadows over all his days, seemed banished for ever.He
was liked and respected in the village in which he had found his
happiness; his charities caused men and women to hold him in something
like affectionate regard; he was Father Daniel's friend, and no case
of suffering or poverty was mentioned to him which he was not ready to
relieve; in Doctor Louis's home he held an honoured place; and he was
loved by a good and pure woman, who had consented to link her fate
with his.Surely in this prospect there was nothing that could be
productive of aught but good.The sweetness and harmony of the time, however, were soon to be
disturbed.After a few weeks of happiness, Gabriel Carew began to be
troubled.In his heart he had no love for the twin brothers, Eric and
Emilius; he believed them to be light-minded and unscrupulous, nay,
more, he believed them to be treacherous in their dealings with both
men and women.These evil qualities, he had decided with himself, they
had inherited from their father, Silvain, whose conduct towards his
unhappy brother Kristel had excited Gabriel Carew's strong abhorrence.As is shown in the comments he makes in his record, all his sympathy
was with Kristel, and he had contracted a passionate antipathy against
Silvain, whom he believed to be guilty of the blackest treachery in
his dealings with Avicia.This antipathy he now transferred to
Silvain's sons, Eric and Emilius, and they needed to be angels, not
men, to overcome it.Not that they tried to win Carew's good opinion.Although his feelings
for them were not openly expressed, they made themselves felt in the
consciousness of these twin brothers, who instinctively recognised
that Gabriel Carew was their enemy.Therefore they held off from him,
and repaid him quietly in kind.But this was a matter solely and
entirely between themselves and known only to themselves.The three
men knew what deep pain and grief it would cause not only Doctor Louis
and his wife, but the gentle Lauretta, to learn that they were in
enmity with each other, and one and all were animated by the same
desire to keep this antagonism from the knowledge of the family.This
was, indeed, a tacit understanding between them, and it was so
thoroughly carried out that no member of Doctor Louis's family
suspected it; and neither was it suspected in the village.To all
outward appearance Gabriel Carew and Eric and Emilius were friends.It was not the brothers but Carew who, in the first instance, was to
blame.He was the originator and the creator of the trouble, for it is
scarcely to be doubted that had he held out the hand of a frank
friendship to them, they would have accepted it, even though their
acceptance needed some sacrifice on their parts.The reason for this
qualification will be apparent to you later on in the story, and you
will then also understand why I do not reveal certain circumstances
respecting the affection of Eric and Emilius for Martin Hartog's
daughter, Patricia, and for the female members of the family of Doctor
Louis.I am relating the story in the
order in which it progressed, and, so far as my knowledge of it goes,
according to the sequence of time.Certainly the dominant cause of Gabriel Carew's hatred for the
brothers sprang from his jealousy of them with respect to Lauretta.They and she had been friends from childhood, and they were regarded
by Doctor Louis and his wife as members of their family.This in
itself was sufficient to inflame so exacting a lover as Carew.He
interpreted every innocent little familiarity to their disadvantage,
and magnified trifles inordinately.They saw his sufferings and were,
perhaps, somewhat scornful of them.He had already shown them how deep
was his hatred of them, and they not unnaturally resented it.After
all, he was a stranger in Nerac, a come-by-chance visitor, who had
usurped the place which might have been occupied by one of them had
the winds been fair.Instead of being overbearing and arrogant he
should have been gracious and conciliating.It was undoubtedly his
duty to be courteous and mannerly from the first day of their
acquaintance; instead of which he had, before he saw them, contracted
a dislike for them which he had allowed to swell to monstrous and
unjustifiable proportions.Gabriel Carew, however, justified himself to himself, and it may be
at once conceded that he had grounds for his feelings which were to
him--and would likely have been to some other men--sufficient.When a lover's suspicious and jealous nature is aroused it does not
from that moment sleep.There is no rest, no repose for it.If it
require opportunities for confirmation or for the infliction of
self-suffering, it is never difficult to find them.Imagination steps
in and supplies the place of fact.Every hour is a torture; every
innocent look and smile is brooded over in secret.A most prolific,
unreasonable, and cruel breeder of shadows is jealousy, and the evil
of it is that it breeds in secret.Gabriel Carew set himself to watch, and from the keen observance of a
nature so thorough and intense as his nothing could escape.He was an
unseen witness of other interviews between Patricia Hartog and
Emilius; and not only of interviews between her and Emilius but
between her and Eric.The brothers were
playing false to each other, and the girl was playing false with both.This was of little account; he had no more than a passing interest in
Patricia, and although at one time he had some kind of intention of
informing Martin Hartog of these secret interviews, and placing the
father on his guard--for the gardener seemed to be quite unaware that
an intrigue was going on--he relinquished the intention, saying that
it was no affair of his.But it confirmed the impressions he had
formed of the character of Eric and Emilius, and it strengthened him
in his determination to allow no intercourse between them and the
woman he loved.An additional torture was in store for him, and it fell upon him like
a thunderbolt.One day he saw Emilius and Lauretta walking in the
woods, talking earnestly and confidentially together.His blood
boiled; his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely distinguish
surrounding objects.So violent was his agitation that it was many
minutes before he recovered himself, and then Lauretta and Emilius had
passed out of sight.He went home in a wild fury of despair.He had not been near enough to hear one word of the conversation, but
their attitude was to him confirmation of his jealous suspicion that
the young man was endeavouring to supplant him in Lauretta's
affections.In the evening he saw Lauretta in her home, and she
noticed a change in him."No," he replied, "I am quite well.The bitterness in his voice surprised her, and she insisted that he
should seek repose."To get me out of the way," he thought; and then,
gazing into her solicitous and innocent eyes, he mutely reproached
himself for doubting her.No, it was not she who was to blame; she was
still his, she was still true to him; but how easy was it for a friend
so close to her as Emilius to instil into her trustful heart evil
reports against himself!"That is the first step," he thought.These men, these villains, are capable of any
treachery.Honour is a stranger to their scheming natures.To meet them openly, to accuse them openly, may be my ruin.They are too firmly fixed in the affections of Doctor Louis and his
wife--they are too firmly fixed in the affections of even Lauretta
herself--for me to hope to expose them upon evidence so slender.Not
slender to me, but to them.These treacherous brothers are conspiring
secretly against me.I will wait and watch till I have the strongest proof
against them, and then I will expose their true characters to Doctor
Louis and Lauretta."Having thus resolved, he was not the man to swerve from the plan he
laid down.The nightly vigils he had kept in his young life served him
now, and it seemed as if he could do without sleep.The stealthy
meetings between Patricia and the brothers continued, and before long
he saw Eric and Lauretta in the woods together.In his espionage he
was always careful not to approach near enough to bring discovery upon
himself.In an indirect manner, as though it was a matter which he deemed of
slight importance, he questioned Lauretta as to her walks in the woods
with Eric and Emilius."Yes," she said artlessly, "we sometimes meet there.""Not always by accident," replied Lauretta."Remember, Gabriel, Eric
and Emilius are as my brothers, and if they have a secret----" And
then she blushed, grew confused, and paused.These signs were poisoned food indeed to Carew, but he did not betray
himself."It was wrong of me to speak," said Lauretta, "after my promise to say
nothing to a single soul in the village.""And most especially," said Carew, hitting the mark, "to me.""Only," he continued, with slight persistence, "that it must be a
heart secret."She was silent, and he dropped the subject.From the interchange of these few words he extracted the most
exquisite torture.There was, then, between Lauretta and the brothers
a secret of the heart, known only to themselves, to be revealed to
none, and to him, Gabriel Carew, to whom the young girl was affianced,
least of all.It must be well understood, in this explanation of what
was occurring in the lives of these young people at that momentous
period, that Gabriel Carew never once suspected that Lauretta was
false to him.His great fear was that Eric and Emilius were working
warily against him, and were cunningly fabricating some kind of
evidence in his disfavour which would rob him of Lauretta's love.They
were conspiring to this end, to the destruction of his happiness, and
they were waiting for the hour to strike the fatal blow.Well, it was
for him to strike first.His love for Lauretta was so all-absorbing
that all other considerations--however serious the direct or indirect
consequences of them--sank into utter insignificance by the side of
it.He did not allow it to weigh against Lauretta that she appeared to
be in collusion with Eric and Emilius, and to be favouring their
schemes.Her nature was so guileless and unsuspecting that she could
be easily led and deceived by friends in whom she placed a trust.It
was this that strengthened Carew in his resolve not to rudely make the
attempt to open her eyes to the perfidy of Eric and Emilius.She would
have been incredulous, and the arguments he should use against his
enemies might be turned against himself.Therefore he adhered to the
line of action he had marked out.He waited, and watched, and
suffered.Meanwhile, the day appointed for his union with Lauretta was
approaching.Within a fortnight of that day Gabriel Carew's passions were roused to
an almost uncontrollable pitch.It was evening, and he saw Eric and Emilius in the woods.They were
conversing with more than ordinary animation, and appeared to be
discussing some question upon which they did not agree.Carew saw
signs which he could not interpret--appeals, implorings, evidences of
strong feeling on one side and of humbleness on the other, despair
from one, sorrow from the other; and then suddenly a phase which
startled the watcher and filled him with a savage joy.Eric, in a
paroxysm, laid hands furiously upon his brother, and it seemed for a
moment as if a violent struggle were about to take place.It was to the restraint and moderation of Emilius that this
unbrotherly conflict was avoided.He did not meet violence with
violence; after a pause he gently lifted Eric's hands from his
shoulders, and with a sad look turned away, Eric gazing at his
retreating figure in a kind of bewilderment.Presently Emilius was
gone, and only Eric remained.From an opposite direction to that taken by
Emilius the watcher saw approaching the form of the woman he loved,
and to whom he was shortly to be wed.That her coming was not
accidental, but in fulfilment of a promise was clear to Gabriel Carew.Eric expected her, and welcomed her without surprise.Then the two
began to converse.Carew's heart beat tumultuously; he would have given worlds to hear
what was being said, but he was at too great a distance for a word to
reach his ears.For a time Eric was the principal speaker, Lauretta,
for the most part, listening, and uttering now and then merely a word
or two.In her quiet way she appeared to be as deeply agitated as the
young man who was addressing her in an attitude of despairing appeal.Again and again it seemed as if he had finished what he had to say,
and again and again he resumed, without abatement of the excitement
under which he was labouring.At length he ceased, and then Lauretta
became the principal actor in the scene.She spoke long and forcibly,
but always with that gentleness of manner which was one of her
sweetest characteristics.In her turn she seemed to be appealing to
the young man, and to be endeavouring to impress upon him a sad and
bitter truth which he was unwilling, and not in the mood, to
recognise.For a long time she was unsuccessful; the young man walked
impatiently a few steps from her, then returned, contrite and humble,
but still with all the signs of great suffering upon him.At length
her words had upon him the effect she desired; he wavered, he held out
his hands helplessly, and presently covered his face with them and
sank to the ground.Then, after a silence, during which Lauretta gazed
compassionately upon his convulsed form, she stooped and placed her
hand upon his shoulder.He lifted his eyes, from which the tears were
flowing, and raised himself from the earth.He stood before her with
bowed head, and she continued to speak.The pitiful sweetness of her
face almost drove Carew mad; it could not be mistaken that her heart
was beating with sympathy for Eric's sufferings.A few minutes more
passed, and then it seemed as if she had prevailed.Eric accepted the
hand she held out to him, and pressed his lips upon it.Had he at that
moment been within Gabriel Carew's reach, it would have fared ill with
both these men, but Heaven alone knows whether it would have averted
what was to follow before the setting of another sun, to the
consternation and grief of the entire village.After pressing his lips
to Lauretta's hand, the pair separated, each going a different way,
and Gabriel Carew ground his teeth as he observed that there were
tears in Lauretta's eyes as well as in Eric's.A darkness fell upon
him as he walked homewards.V.


The following morning Nerac and the neighbourhood around were agitated
by news of a tragedy more thrilling and terrible than that in which
the hunchback and his companion in crime were concerned.In attendance
upon this tragedy, and preceding its discovery, was a circumstance
stirring enough in its way in the usually quiet life of the simple
villagers, but which, in the light of the mysterious tragedy, would
have paled into insignificance had it not been that it appeared to
have a direct bearing upon it.Martin Hartog's daughter, Patricia, had
fled from her home, and was nowhere to be discovered.This flight was made known to the villagers early in the morning by
the appearance among them of Martin Hartog, demanding in which house
his daughter had taken refuge.The man was distracted; his wild words
and actions excited great alarm, and when he found that he could
obtain no satisfaction from them, and that every man and woman in
Nerac professed ignorance of his daughter's movements, he called down
heaven's vengeance upon the man who had betrayed her, and left them to
search the woods for Patricia.The words he had uttered in his imprecations when he called upon a
higher power for vengeance on a villain opened the villagers' eyes.Who was the monster who had
worked this evil?While they were talking excitedly together they saw Gabriel Carew
hurrying to the house of Father Daniel.He was admitted, and in the
course of a few minutes emerged from it in the company of the good
priest, whose troubled face denoted that he had heard the sad news of
Patricia's flight from her father's home.The villagers held aloof
from Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew, seeing that they were in earnest
converse.Carew was imparting to the priest his suspicions of Eric and
Emilius in connection with this event; he did not mention Lauretta's
name, but related how on several occasions he had been an accidental
witness of meetings between Patricia and one or other of the brothers."It was not for me to place a construction upon these meetings," said
Carew, "nor did it appear to me that I was called upon to mention it
to any one.It would have been natural for me to suppose that Martin
Hartog was fully acquainted with his daughter's movements, and that,
being of an independent nature, he would have resented any
interference from me.He is Patricia's father, and it was believed by
all that he guarded her well.Had he been my equal I might have
incidentally asked whether there was anything serious between his
daughter and these brothers, but I am his master, and therefore was
precluded from inviting a confidence which can only exist between men
occupying the same social condition.There is, besides, another reason
for my silence which, if you care to hear, I will impart to you.""Nothing should be concealed from me," said Father Daniel."Although," said Gabriel Carew, "I have been a resident here now for
some time, I felt, and feel, that a larger knowledge of me is
necessary to give due and just weight to the unfavourable opinion I
have formed of two men with whom you have been acquainted from
childhood, and who hold a place in your heart of which they are
utterly unworthy.Not alone in your heart, but in the hearts of my
dearest friends, Doctor Louis and his family."You refer to Eric and Emilius," said the priest."What you have already said concerning them has deeply pained me.Their meetings with Hartog's daughter were,
I am convinced, innocent.They are incapable of an act of baseness;
they are of noble natures, and it is impossible that they should ever
have harboured a thought of treachery to a young maiden.""I am more than justified," said Gabriel Carew, "by the expression of
your opinion, in the course I took.You would have listened with
impatience to me, and what I should have said would have recoiled on
myself.Yet now I regret that I did not interfere; this calamity might
have been avoided, and a woman's honour saved.Let us seek Martin
Hartog; he may be in possession of information to guide us."From the villagers they learnt that Hartog had gone to the woods, and
they were about to proceed in that direction when another, who had
just arrived, informed them that he had seen Hartog going to Gabriel
Carew's house.Thither they proceeded, and found Hartog in his
cottage.He was on his knees, when they entered, before a box in which
his daughter kept her clothes.This he had forced open, and was
searching.He looked wildly at Father Daniel and Carew, and
immediately resumed his task, throwing the girl's clothes upon the
floor after examining the pockets.In his haste and agitation he did
not observe a portrait which he had cast aside, Carew picked it up and
handed it to Father Daniel."Who is the more
likely to be right in our estimate of these brothers, you or I?"Father Daniel, overwhelmed by the evidence, did not reply.By this
time Martin Hartog had found a letter which he was eagerly perusing."If there is justice in heaven he has
met with his deserts.If he still lives he shall die by my hands!""Vengeance is not yours to deal
out.Pray for comfort--pray for mercy."If the monster be not already smitten, Lord, give him into
my hands!The
cunning villain has not even signed his name!"Father Daniel took the letter from his unresisting hand, and as his
eyes fell upon the writing he started and trembled.It was indeed the writing of Emilius.Martin Hartog had heard Carew's
inquiry and the priest's reply.And without another word he rushed
from the cottage.Carew and the priest hastily followed him, but he
outstripped them, and was soon out of sight."There will be a deed of violence done," said Father Daniel, "if the
men meet.I must go immediately to the house of these unhappy brothers
and warn them."Carew accompanied him, but when they arrived at the house they were
informed that nothing had been seen of Eric and Emilius since the
previous night.Neither of them had been home nor slept in his bed.This seemed to complicate the mystery in Father Daniel's eyes,
although it was no mystery to Carew, who was convinced that where
Patricia was there would Emilius be found.Father Daniel's grief and
horror were clearly depicted.He looked upon the inhabitants of Nerac
as one family, and he regarded the dishonour of Martin Hartog's
daughter as dishonour to all.Carew, being anxious to see Lauretta,
left him to his inquiries.Louis and his family were already
acquainted with the agitating news."Dark clouds hang over this once happy village," said Doctor Louis to
Carew.He was greatly shocked, but he had no hesitation in declaring that,
although circumstances looked black against the twin brothers, his
faith in them was undisturbed.Lauretta shared his belief, and
Lauretta's mother also.Gabriel Carew did not combat with them; he
held quietly to his views, convinced that in a short time they would
think as he did.Lauretta was very pale, and out of consideration for
her Gabriel Carew endeavoured to avoid the all-engrossing subject.Nothing else could be thought or spoken
of.Once Carew remarked
to Lauretta, "You said that Eric and Emilius had a secret, and you
gave me to understand that you were not ignorant of it.Has it any
connection with what has occurred?""I must not answer you, Gabriel," she replied; "when we see Emilius
again all will be explained."Little did she suspect the awful import of those simple words.In
Carew's mind the remembrance of the story of Kristel and Silvain was
very vivid."Were Eric and Emilius true friends?"Lauretta looked at him piteously; her lips quivered."They are
brothers," she said.She gazed at him in tender surprise; for weeks past he had not been so
happy.The trouble by which he had been haunted took flight."And yet," he could not help saying, "you have a secret, and you keep
it from me!"His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by

      | INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME.Clery was not so fortunate as to escape the frightful spectacle.He had
gone down to dine with Tison and his wife, employed as servants in the
Temple, and says: "We were hardly seated when a head, on the end of a
pike, was presented at the window.Tison's wife gave a great cry; the
assassins fancied they recognised the Queen's voice, and responded by
savage laughter.Under the idea that his Majesty was still at table, they
placed their dreadful trophy where it must be seen.It was the head of
the Princesse de Lamballe; although bleeding, it was not disfigured, and
her light hair, still in curls, hung about the pike."At length the immense mob that surrounded the Temple gradually withdrew,
"to follow the head of the Princess de Lamballe to the Palais Royal."[The pike that bore the head was fixed before the Duc d'Orleans's window
as he was going to dinner.It is said that he looked at this horrid sight
without horror, went into the dining-room, sat down to table, and helped
his guests without saying a word.His silence and coolness left it
doubtful whether the assassins, in presenting him this bloody trophy,
intended to offer him an insult or to pay him homage.--DE MOLLEVILLE'S
"Annals of the French Revolution," vol.Meanwhile the royal family could scarcely believe that for the time their
lives were saved."My aunt and I heard the drums beating to arms all
night," says Madame Royale; "my unhappy mother did not even attempt to
sleep.In the comparative tranquillity which followed the September massacres,
the royal family resumed the regular habits they had adopted on entering
the Temple."The King usually rose at six in the morning," says Clery."He shaved himself, and I dressed his hair; he then went to his
reading-room, which, being very small, the municipal officer on duty
remained in the bedchamber with the door open, that he might always keep
the King in sight.His Majesty continued praying on his knees for some
time, and then read till nine.During that interval, after putting his
chamber to rights and preparing the breakfast, I went down to the Queen,
who never opened her door till I arrived, in order to prevent the
municipal officer from going into her apartment.At nine o'clock the
Queen, the children, and Madame Elisabeth went up to the King's chamber to
breakfast.At ten the King and his family went down to the Queen's
chamber, and there passed the day.He employed himself in educating his
son, made him recite passages from Corneille and Racine, gave him lessons
in geography, and exercised him in colouring the maps.The Queen, on her
part, was employed in the education of her daughter, and these different
lessons lasted till eleven o'clock.The remaining time till noon was
passed in needlework, knitting, or making tapestry.At one o'clock, when
the weather was fine, the royal family were conducted to the garden by
four municipal officers and the commander of a legion of the National
Guard.As there were a number of workmen in the Temple employed in pulling
down houses and building new walls, they only allowed a part of the
chestnut-tree walk for the promenade, in which I was allowed to share, and
where I also played with the young Prince at ball, quoits, or races.At
two we returned to the Tower, where I served the dinner, at which time
Santerre regularly came to the Temple, attended by two aides-de-camp.The
King sometimes spoke to him,--the Queen never."After the meal the royal family came down into the Queen's room, and
their Majesties generally played a game of piquet or tric-trac.At four
o'clock the King took a little repose, the Princesses round him, each with
a book.When the King woke the conversation was resumed, and I
gave writing lessons to his son, taking the copies, according to his
instructions, from the works of, Montesquieu and other celebrated authors.After the lesson I took the young Prince into Madame Elisabeth's room,
where we played at ball, and battledore and shuttlecock.In the evening
the family sat round a table, while the Queen read to them from books of
history, or other works proper to instruct and amuse the children.Madame
Elisabeth took the book in her turn, and in this manner they read till
eight o'clock.After that I served the supper of the young Prince, in
which the royal family shared, and the King amused the children with
charades out of a collection of French papers which he found in the
library.After the Dauphin had supped, I undressed him, and the Queen
heard him say his prayers.At nine the King went to supper, and
afterwards went for a moment to the Queen's chamber, shook hands with her
and his sister for the night, kissed his children, and then retired to the
turret-room, where he sat reading till midnight.The Queen and the
Princesses locked themselves in, and one of the municipal officers
remained in the little room which parted their chamber, where he passed
the night; the other followed his Majesty.In this manner was the time
passed as long as the King remained in the small tower."But even these harmless pursuits were too often made the means of further
insulting and thwarting the unfortunate family.Commissary Le Clerc
interrupted the Prince's writing lessons, proposing to substitute
Republican works for those from which the King selected his copies.A
smith, who was present when the Queen was reading the history of France to
her children, denounced her to the Commune for choosing the period when
the Connstable de Bourbon took arms against France, and said she wished to
inspire her son with unpatriotic feelings; a municipal officer asserted
that the multiplication table the Prince was studying would afford a means
of "speaking in cipher," so arithmetic had to be abandoned.Much the same
occurred even with the needlework, the Queen and Princess finished some
chairbacks, which they wished to send to the Duchesse de Tarente; but the
officials considered that the patterns were hieroglyphics, intended for
carrying on a correspondence, and ordered that none of the Princesses work
should leave the Temple.The short daily walk in the garden was also
embittered by the rude behaviour of the military and municipal gaolers;
sometimes, however, it afforded an opportunity for marks of sympathy to be
shown.People would station themselves at the windows of houses
overlooking the Temple gardens, and evince by gestures their loyal
affection, and some of the sentinels showed, even by tears, that their
duty was painful to them.On the 21st September the National Convention was constituted, Petion
being made president and Collot d'Herbois moving the "abolition of
royalty" amidst transports of applause.That afternoon a municipal
officer attended by gendarmes a cheval, and followed by a crowd of people,
arrived at the Temple, and, after a flourish of trumpets, proclaimed the
establishment of the French Republic.The man, says Clery, "had the voice
of a Stentor."The royal family could distinctly hear the announcement of
the King's deposition."Hebert, so well known under the title of Pere
Duchesne, and Destournelles were on guard.They were sitting near the
door, and turned to the King with meaning smiles.He had a book in his
hand, and went on reading without changing countenance.The proclamation finished, the trumpets sounded
afresh.I went to the window; the people took me for Louis XVI.and I was
overwhelmed with insults."After the new decree the prisoners were treated with increased harshness.Pens, paper, ink, and pencils were taken from them.The King and Madame
Elisabeth gave up all, but the Queen and her daughter each concealed a
pencil."In the beginning of October," says Madame Royale, "after my
father had supped, he was told to stop, that he was not to return to his
former apartments, and that he was to be separated from his family.At
this dreadful sentence the Queen lost her usual courage.We parted from
him with abundance of tears, though we expected to see him again in the
morning.[At nine o'clock, says Clery, the King asked to be taken to his family,
but the municipal officers replied that they had "no orders for that."Shortly afterwards a boy brought the King some bread and a decanter of
lemonade for his breakfast.The King gave half the bread to Clery,
saying, "It seems they have forgotten your breakfast; take this, the rest
is enough for me."Clery refused, but the King insisted."I could not
contain my tears," he adds; "the King perceived them, and his own fell
also."]They brought in our breakfast separately from his, however.The officers, alarmed at her silent and concentrated
sorrow, allowed us to see the King, but at meal-times only, and on
condition that we should not speak low, nor in any foreign language, but
loud and in 'good French.'We went down, therefore, with the greatest joy
to dine with my father.In the evening, when my brother was in bed, my
mother and my aunt alternately sat with him or went with me to sup with my
father.In the morning, after breakfast, we remained in the King's
apartments while Clery dressed our hair, as he was no longer allowed to
come to my mother's room, and this arrangement gave us the pleasure of
spending a few moments more with my father."[When the first deputation from the Council of the Commune visited the
Temple, and formally inquired whether the King had any complaint to make,
he replied, "No; while he was permitted to remain with his family he was
happy."]The royal prisoners had no comfort except their affection for each other.At that time even common necessaries were denied them.Their small stock
of linen had been lent them; by persons of the Court during the time they
spent at the Feuillans.The Princesses mended their clothes every day,
and after the King had gone to bed Madame Elisabeth mended his."With
much trouble," says Clrry, "I procured some fresh linen for them.But the
workwomen having marked it with crowned letters, the Princesses were
ordered to pick them out."The room in the great tower to which the King
had been removed contained only one bed, and no other article of
furniture.A chair was brought on which Clery spent the first night;
painters were still at work on the room, and the smell of the paint, he
says, was almost unbearable.This room was afterwards furnished by
collecting from various parts of the Temple a chest of drawers, a small
bureau, a few odd chairs, a chimney-glass, and a bed hung with green
damask, which had been used by the captain of the guard to the Comte
d'Artois.A room for the Queen was being prepared over that of the King,
and she implored the workmen to finish it quickly, but it was not ready
for her occupation for some time, and when she was allowed to remove to it
the Dauphin was taken from her and placed with his father.When their
Majesties met again in the great Tower, says Clery, there was little
change in the hours fixed for meals, reading, walking and the education of
their children.They were not allowed to have mass said in the Temple,
and therefore commissioned Clery to get them the breviary in use in the
diocese of Paris.Among the books read by the King while in the Tower
were Hume's "History of England" (in the original), Tasso, and the "De
Imitatione Christi."The jealous suspicions of the municipal officers led
to the most absurd investigations; a draught-board was taken to pieces
lest the squares should hide treasonable papers; macaroons were broken in
half to see that they did not contain letters; peaches were cut open and
the stones cracked; and Clery was compelled to drink the essence of soap
prepared for shaving the King, under the pretence that it might contain
poison.In November the King and all the family had feverish colds, and Clery had
an attack of rheumatic fever.On the first day of his illness he got up
and tried to dress his master, but the King, seeing how ill he was,
ordered him to lie down, and himself dressed the Dauphin.The little
Prince waited on Clery all day, and in the evening the King contrived to
approach his bed, and said, in a low voice, "I should like to take care of
you myself, but you know how we are watched.Take courage; tomorrow you
shall see my doctor."Madame Elisabeth brought the valet cooling
draughts, of which she deprived herself; and after Clery was able to get
up, the young Prince one night with great difficulty kept awake till
eleven o'clock in order to give him a box of lozenges when he went to make
the King's bed.On 7th December a deputation from the Commune brought an order that the
royal family should be deprived of "knives, razors, scissors, penknives,
and all other cutting instruments."The King gave up a knife, and took
from a morocco case a pair of scissors and a penknife; and the officials
then searched the room, taking away the little toilet implements of gold
and silver, and afterwards removing the Princesses' working materials.Returning to the King's room, they insisted upon seeing what remained in
his pocket-case."Are these toys which I have in my hand also cutting
instruments?"asked the King, showing them a cork-screw, a turn-screw,
and a steel for lighting.Shortly
afterwards Madame Elisabeth was mending the King's coat, and, having no
scissors, was compelled to break the thread with her teeth."You wanted
nothing in your pretty house at Montreuil.""Ah, brother," she answered, "how can I have any regret when I partake
your misfortunes?"The Queen had frequently to take on herself some of the humble duties of a
servant.when the anniversary
of some State festival brought the contrast between past and present with
unusual keenness before him."Ah, Madame," he once exclaimed, "what an employment for a Queen of
France!Who would have foreseen that, in
uniting your lot to mine, you would have descended so low?""And do you esteem as nothing," she replied, "the glory of being the wife
of one of the best and most persecuted of men?Are not such misfortunes
the noblest honours?"--[Alison's "History of Europe," vol.Meanwhile the Assembly had decided that the King should be brought to
trial.Nearly all parties, except the Girondists, no matter how bitterly
opposed to each other, could agree in making him the scapegoat; and the
first rumour of the approaching ordeal was conveyed to the Temple by
Clery's wife, who, with a friend, had permission occasionally to visit
him."I did not know how to announce this terrible news to the King," he
says; "but time was pressing, and he had forbidden my concealing anything
from him.In the evening, while undressing him, I gave him an account of
all I had learnt, and added that there were only four days to concert some
plan of corresponding with the Queen.The arrival of the municipal
officer would not allow me to say more.Next morning, when the King rose,
I could not get a moment for speaking with him.He went up with his son
to breakfast with the Princesses, and I followed.After breakfast he
talked long with the Queen, who, by a look full of trouble, made me
understand that they were discussing what I had told the King.During the
day I found an opportunity of describing to Madame Elisabeth how much it
had cost me to augment the King's distresses by informing him of his
approaching trial.She reassured me, saying that the King felt this as a
mark of attachment on my part, and added, 'That which most troubles him is
the fear of being separated from us.'In the evening the King told me how
satisfied he was at having had warning that he was to appear before the
Convention.'Continue,' he said, 'to endeavour to find out something as
to what they want to do with me.I have
agreed with my family not to seem pre-informed, in order not to compromise
you.'"On the 11th December, at five o'clock in the morning, the prisoners heard
the generale beaten throughout Paris, and cavalry and cannon entered the
Temple gardens.At nine the King and the Dauphin went as usual to
breakfast with the Queen.They were allowed to remain together for an
hour, but constantly under the eyes of their republican guardians.At
last they were obliged to part, doubtful whether they would ever see each
other again.The little Prince, who remained with his father, and was
ignorant of the new cause for anxiety, begged hard that the King would
play at ninepins with him as usual.Twice the Dauphin could not get
beyond a certain number."Each time that I get up to sixteen," he said,
with some vexation, "I lose the game."The King did not reply, but Clery
fancied the words made a painful impression on him.At eleven, while the King was giving the Dauphin a reading lesson, two
municipal officers entered and said they had come "to take young Louis to
his mother."The King inquired why, but was only told that such were the
orders of the Council.At one o'clock the Mayor of Paris, Chambon,
accompanied by Chaumette, Procureur de la Commune, Santerre, commandant of
the National Guard, and others, arrived at the Temple and read a decree to
the King, which ordered that "Louis Capet" should be brought before the
Convention."Capet is not my name," he replied, "but that of one of my
ancestors.I could have wished," he added, "that you had left my son with
me during the last two hours.But this treatment is consistent with all I
have experienced here.I follow you, not because I recognise the
authority of the Convention, but because I can be compelled to obey it."He then followed the Mayor to a carriage which waited, with a numerous
escort, at the gate of the Temple.The family left behind were
overwhelmed with grief and apprehension."It is impossible to describe
the anxiety we suffered," says Madame Royale."My mother used every
endeavour with the officer who guarded her to discover what was passing;
it was the first time she had condescended to question any of these men.Trial of the King.--Parting of the Royal Family.--Execution.The crowd was immense as, on the morning of the 11th December, 1792, Louis
XVI.was driven slowly from the Temple to the Convention, escorted by
cavalry, infantry, and artillery.Paris looked like an armed camp: all
the posts were doubled; the muster-roll of the National Guard was called
over every hour; a picket of two hundred men watched in the court of each
of the right sections; a reserve with cannon was stationed at the
Tuileries, and strong detachments patroled the streets and cleared the
road of all loiterers.The trees that lined the boulevards, the doors and
windows of the houses, were alive with gazers, and all eyes were fixed on
the King.He was much changed since his people last beheld him.The beard
he had been compelled to grow after his razors were taken from him covered
cheeks, lips, and chin with light-coloured hair, which concealed the
melancholy expression of his mouth; he had become thin, and his garments
hung loosely on him; but his manner was perfectly collected and calm, and
he recognised and named to the Mayor the various quarters through which he
passed.On arriving at the Feuillans he was taken to a room to await the
orders of the Assembly.It was about half-past two when the King appeared at the bar.The Mayor
and Generaux Santerre and Wittengoff were at his side.Profound silence
pervaded the Assembly.All were touched by the King's dignity and the
composure of his looks under so great a reverse of fortune.By nature he
had been formed rather to endure calamity with patience than to contend
against it with energy.The approach of death could not disturb his
serenity."Louis, you may be seated," said Barere."Answer the questions that shall
be put to you."The King seated himself and listened to the reading of
the 'acte enonciatif', article by article.All the faults of the Court
were there enumerated and imputed to Louis XVI.He was charged
with the interruption of the sittings of the 20th of June, 1789, with the
Bed of Justice held on the 23d of the same month, the aristocratic
conspiracy thwarted by the insurrection of the 14th of July, the
entertainment of the Life Guards, the insults offered to the national
cockade, the refusal to sanction the Declaration of Rights, as well as
several constitutional articles; lastly, all the facts which indicated a
new conspiracy in October, and which were followed by the scenes of the
5th and 6th; the speeches of reconciliation which had succeeded all these
scenes, and which promised a change that was not sincere; the false oath
taken at the Federation of the 14th of July; the secret practices of Talon
and Mirabeau to effect a counter-revolution; the money spent in bribing a
great number of deputies; the assemblage of the "knights of the dagger" on
the 28th of February, 1791; the flight to Varennes; the fusilade of the
Champ de Mars; the silence observed respecting the Treaty of Pilnitz; the
delay in the promulgation of the decree which incorporated Avignon with
France; the commotions at Nimes, Montauban, Mende, and Jales; the
continuance of their pay to the emigrant Life Guards and to the disbanded
Constitutional Guard; the insufficiency of the armies assembled on the
frontiers; the refusal to sanction the decree for the camp of twenty
thousand men; the disarming of the fortresses; the organisation of secret
societies in the interior of Paris; the review of the Swiss and the
garrison of the palace on the 10th August; the summoning the Mayor to the
Tuileries; and lastly, the effusion of blood which had resulted from these
military dispositions.After each article the President paused, and said,
"What have you to answer?"The King, in a firm voice, denied some of the
facts, imputed others to his ministers, and always appealed to the
constitution, from which he declared he had never deviated.His answers
were very temperate, but on the charge, "You spilt the blood of the people
on the 10th of August," he exclaimed, with emphasis, "No, monsieur, no; it
was not I."All the papers on which the act of accusation was founded were then shown
to the King, and he disavowed some of them and disputed the existence of
the iron chest; this produced a bad impression, and was worse than
useless, as the fact had been proved.[A secret closet which the King had directed to be constructed in a wall
in the Tuileries.The door was of iron, whence it was afterwards known by
the name of the iron chest.Throughout the examination the King showed great presence of mind.He was
careful in his answers never to implicate any members of the constituent,
and legislative Assemblies; many who then sat as his judges trembled lest
he should betray them.The Jacobins beheld with dismay the profound
impression made on the Convention by the firm but mild demeanour of the
sovereign.The most violent of the party proposed that he should be
hanged that very night; a laugh as of demons followed the proposal from
the benches of the Mountain, but the majority, composed of the Girondists
and the neutrals, decided that he should be formally tried.After the examination  Santerre took the King by the arm and led him back
to the waiting-room of the Convention, accompanied by Chambon and
Chaumette.Mental agitation and the length of the proceedings had
exhausted him, and he staggered from weakness.Chaumette inquired if he
wished for refreshment, but the King refused it.A moment after, seeing a
grenadier of the escort offer the Procureur de la Commune half a small
loaf, Louis XVI.approached and asked him, in a whisper, for a piece."Ask aloud for what you want," said Chaumette, retreating as though he
feared being suspected of pity."I asked for a piece of your bread," replied the King."Divide it with me," said Chaumette.If I
had a root I would give you half."--[Lamartine's "History of the
Girondists," edit.Soon after six in the evening the King returned to the Temple."He seemed
tired," says Clery, simply, "and his first wish was to be led to his
family.The officers refused, on the plea that they had no orders.He
insisted that at least they should be informed of his return, and this was
promised him.The King ordered me to ask for his supper at half-past
eight.The intervening hours he employed in his usual reading, surrounded
by four municipals.When I announced that supper was served, the King
asked the commissaries if his family could not come down.'But at least,' the King said,'my son will pass the night in my
room, his bed being here?'After supper the King again
urged his wish to see his family.They answered that they must await the
decision of the Convention.While I was undressing him the King said, 'I
was far from expecting all the questions they put to me.'The order for my removal during the night was not
executed."On the King's return to the Temple being known, "my mother
asked to see him instantly," writes Madame Royale."She made the same
request even to Chambon, but received no answer.My brother passed the
night with her; and as he had no bed, she gave him hers, and sat up all
the night in such deep affliction that we were afraid to leave her; but
she compelled my aunt and me to go to bed.Next day she again asked to
see my father, and to read the newspapers, that she might learn the course
of the trial.She entreated that if she was to be denied this indulgence,
his children, at least, might see him.Her requests were referred to the
Commune.The newspapers were refused; but my brother and I were to be
allowed to see my father on condition of being entirely separated from my
mother.My father replied that, great as his happiness was in seeing his
children, the important business which then occupied him would not allow
of his attending altogether to his son, and that his daughter could not
leave her mother."[During their last interview Madame Elisabeth had given Clery one of her
handkerchiefs, saying, "You shall keep it so long as my brother continues
well; if he becomes ill, send it to me among my nephew's things."]The Assembly having, after a violent debate, resolved that Louis XVI.should have the aid of counsel, a deputation was sent to the Temple to ask
whom he would choose.The King named Messieurs Target and Tronchet.The
former refused his services on the ground that he had discontinued
practice since 1785; the latter complied at once with the King's request;
and while the Assembly was considering whom to, nominate in Target's
place, the President received a letter from the venerable Malesherbes,

[Christian Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, an eminent French
statesman, son of the Chancellor of France, was born at Paris in 1721.In
1750 he succeeded his father as President of the Court of Aids, and was
also made superintendent of the press.On the banishment of the
Parliaments and the suppression of the Court of Aids, Malesherbes was
exiled to his country-seat.In 1775 he was appointed Minister of State.On the decree of the Convention for the King's trial, he emerged from his
retreat to become the voluntary advocate of his sovereign.Malesherbes
was guillotined in 1794, and almost his whole family were extirpated by
their merciless persecutors.]then seventy years old, and "the most respected magistrate in France," in
the course of which he said: "I have been twice called to be counsel for
him who was my master, in times when that duty was coveted by every one.I
owe him the same service now that it is a duty which many people deem
dangerous.If I knew any possible means of acquainting him with my
desires, I should not take the liberty of addressing myself to you."Other
citizens made similar proposals, but the King, being made acquainted with
them by a deputation from the Commune, while expressing his gratitude for
all the offers, accepted only that of Malesherbes.[The Citoyenne Olympia Degonges, calling herself a free and loyal
Republican without spot or blame, and declaring that the cold and selfish
cruelty of Target had inflamed her heroism and roused her sensibility,
asked permission to assist M, de Malesherbes in defending the King.The
Assembly passed to the order of the day on this request.--BERTRAND DE
MOLLEVILLE, "Annals," edit.1802, vol, viii., p.On 14th December M. Tronchet was allowed to confer with the King, and
later in the same day M. de Malesherbes was admitted to the Tower."The
King ran up to this worthy old man, whom he clasped in his arms," said
Clery, "and the former minister melted into tears at the sight of his
master."[According to M. de Hue, "The first time M. de Malesherbes entered the
Temple, the King clasped him in his arms and said, 'Ah, is it you, my
friend?You fear not to endanger your own life to save mine; but all will
be useless.No matter; I shall gain
my cause if I leave an unspotted memory behind me.'"]Another deputation brought the King the Act of Accusation and the
documents relating to it, numbering more than a hundred, and taking from
four o'clock till midnight to read.During this long process the King had
refreshments served to the deputies, taking nothing himself till they had
left, but considerately reproving Clery for not having supped.From the
14th to the 26th December the King saw his counsel and their colleague M.
de Size every day.At this time a means of communication between the
royal family and the King was devised: a man named Turgi, who had been in
the royal kitchen, and who contrived to obtain employment in the Temple,
when conveying the meals of the royal family to their apartments, or
articles he had purchased for them, managed to give Madame Elisabeth news
of the King.Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was removing the dinner,
slipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she had pricked with a pin a
request for a word from her brother's own hand.Turgi gave this paper to
Clery, who conveyed it to the King the same evening; and he, being allowed
writing materials while preparing his defence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a
short note.An answer was conveyed in a ball of cotton, which Turgi threw
under Clery's bed while passing the door of his room.Letters were also
passed between the Princess's room and that of Clery, who lodged beneath
her, by means of a string let down and drawn up at night.This
communication with his family was a great comfort to the King, who,
nevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful servant."Take care," he
would say kindly, "you expose yourself too much."[The King's natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the Temple.His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy with the
smaller troubles of others.A servant in the Temple named Marchand, the
father of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs, --his wages for two
months.The King observed his distress, asked its cause, and gave Clery
the amount to be handed to Marchand, with a caution not to speak of it to
any one, and, above all, not to thank the King, lest it should injure him
with his employers.]During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the
garden.When it was proposed to him he said, "I cannot make up my mind to
go out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with my
family."But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful reflections.He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised them by his
varied and practical knowledge of their trades, and his interest in their
domestic affairs.On the 19th December the King's breakfast was served as
usual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take anything.At dinner-time
the King said to Clery, "Fourteen years ago you were up earlier than you
were to-day; it is the day my daughter was born--today, her birthday," he
repeated, with tears, "and to be prevented from seeing her!"Madame
Royale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered Clery to buy her the
"Almanac of the Republic," which had replaced the "Court Almanac," and ran
through it, marking with a pencil many names."On Christmas Day," Says Clery, "the King wrote his will."[Madame Royale says: "On the 26th December, St.Stephen's Day, my father
made his will, because he expected to be assassinated that day on his way
to the bar of the Convention.He went thither, nevertheless, with his
usual calmness."On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the
Convention.M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his
defence.The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too
rhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.[When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King, the
evening before it was delivered to the Assembly, "I have to request of
you," he said, "to make a painful sacrifice; strike out of your pleading
the peroration.It is enough for me to appear before such judges, and
show my entire innocence; I will not move their feelings.--"LACRETELLE.]At half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to
conduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions
and in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion.Riding
in the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the same
composure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.Arrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he
seated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure
the benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine their
faces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the pleading
of M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with Tronchet and
Malesherbes.The Assembly received his defence in sullen silence, but
without any tokens of disapprobation.Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the King
showed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the long
defence.While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his companions
with the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent
tumult arose there.Others,
complaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,
demanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the
accused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.Lanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an
indignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to
repress.He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his
presence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.He
exclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the Assembly
ought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment on Louis
XVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the Assembly in
particular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as a political
body, it could do no more than take measures of safety against the
ci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of justice it was
overstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the vanquished to be
tried by the conquerors, since most of the present members had declared
themselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.At the word
"conspirators" a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.Lanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word "conspirators," saying that
he meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of August
was a glorious conspiracy.He concluded by declaring that he would rather
die a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws, even the most
execrable of tyrants.A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually
increased.The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled
together, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.After a
tempest of an hour's duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the
Assembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on the
trial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should be
continued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence should be
passed.The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a
constant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.Vergniaud at
length ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary
eagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments
by the lips of their greatest orator.The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.Robespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.Vergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which
wavered between the two parties.Several members were successively heard,
for and against the appeal to the people.Brissot, Gensonne, Petion,
supported it in their turn.One speaker at length had a decisive
influence on the question.Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and
evasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.He spoke at
great length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings--of facts, of
laws, and of policy--and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted
specious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the
King.The
discussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the
continual repetition of the same facts and arguments.It was therefore
declared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh
adjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a
decree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the
vote.Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his
outward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.On the
morning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the
commissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen a
copy of the King's printed defence, asked for something which had belonged
to him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck handkerchief
and gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another municipal, who had made
the same request."On January 1st," says Clery, "I approached the King's
bed and asked permission to offer him my warmest prayers for the end of
his misfortunes.'I accept your good wishes with affection,' he replied,
extending his hand to me.As soon as he had risen, he requested a
municipal to go and inquire for his family, and present them his good
wishes for the new year.The officers were moved by the tone in which
these words, so heartrending considering the position of the King, were
pronounced.The correspondence between their Majesties went on
constantly.The King being informed that Madame Royale was ill, was very
uneasy for some days.The Queen, after begging earnestly, obtained
permission for M. Brunnier, the medical attendant of the royal children,
to come to the Temple.The nearer the moment which was to decide the King's fate approached, the
greater became the agitation in, Paris."A report was circulated that the
atrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners and
their relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would
snatch them from destruction.The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that
conspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.from
punishment, and to restore royalty.Their anger, excited by delays and
obstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus
alarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs."On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,
being the final judgment of Louis XVI."The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial," says Hazlitt,
"lasted seventy-two hours.It might naturally be supposed that silence,
restraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.On the
contrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the most
grotesque confusion.The farther end of the hall was converted into
boxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,
liqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,
as on ordinary occasions.Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side
opened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc
d'Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation
was strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant 'Ha, ha's!'of
the mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,
whenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of
death.The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole
trial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as
in a tavern."Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring
coffee-houses.Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every
countenance.The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by
the pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only the
word--Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to dinner
before they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in order to
count the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only waking up to
give their sentence,--all this had the appearance rather of a hideous
dream than of a reality."The Duc d'Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his
King and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than
death itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:
"Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have
resisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for
death!"Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was
to the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously
selfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the
agitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single
vote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny was
proclaimed as follows


     Against an appeal to the people........... 480
     For an appeal to the people............... 283

     Majority for final judgment............... 197


The President having announced that he was about to declare the result of
the scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the following
declaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319 were for
imprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment, eight for a
suspension of the execution of the sentence of death until after the
expulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for not putting
him to death until the French territory was invaded by any foreign power,
and one was for a sentence of death, but with power of commutation of the
punishment.After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his
voice, said: "In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that
the punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet
is DEATH!"Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the
part of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish
Minister relative to that sentence.The Convention, however, refused to
hear it.[It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was forwarded
by the English Government.]M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the
Temple at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th?.During the calling of the votes
he asked M. de Malesherbes, "Have you not met near the Temple the White
Lady?""Do you not know," resumed the
King with a smile, "that when a prince of our house is about to die, a
female dressed in white is seen wandering about the palace?My friends,"
added he to his defenders, "I am about to depart before you for the land
of the just, but there, at least, we shall be reunited."In fact, his
Majesty's only apprehension seemed to be for his family.--ALISON.]"All is lost," he said to Clery.The King, who
saw him arrive, rose to receive him.[When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of the
vote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and absorbed
in a deep reverie.Without inquiring concerning his fate, he said: "For
two hours I have been considering whether, during my whole reign, I have
voluntarily given any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect
sincerity I declare that I deserve no reproach at their hands, and that I
have never formed a wish but for their happiness."M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.The King
raised him up and affectionately embraced him.When he could control his
voice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to
death; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only
affected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI.was awaiting
his advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.He stopped
with dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved: Garat then
told him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate to him the
decrees of the Convention.Grouvelle, secretary of the Executive Council,
read them to him.guilty of treason against
the general safety of the State; the second condemned him to death; the
third rejected any appeal to the people; and the fourth and last ordered
his execution in twenty-four hours.Louis, looking calmly round, took the
paper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a letter, in which he demanded from
the Convention three days to prepare for death, a confessor to assist him
in his last moments, liberty to see his family, and permission for them to
leave France.Garat took the letter, promising to submit it immediately
to the Convention.then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his
dinner, and ate as usual.There were no knives on the table, and his
attendants refused to let him have any."Do they think me so cowardly,"
he exclaimed, "as to lay violent hands on myself?I am innocent, and I am
not afraid to die."The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he
had made.Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom
Louis XVI.had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.M.
Edgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have
thrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed
tears of emotion.He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions
concerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the
Archbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died
faithfully attached to his communion.--The clock having struck eight, he
rose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that
he was going to see his family.The municipal officers, unwilling to lose
sight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he should
see them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which they
could watch all his motions without hearing what he said.At half-past
eight the door opened.The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand, Madame
Elisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis XVI.The door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M. Edgeworth
placed themselves behind it.During the first moments, it was but a scene
of confusion and despair.Cries and lamentations prevented those who were
on the watch from distinguishing anything.At length the conversation
became more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King clasped in
their arms, spoke with him in a low tone."He related his trial to my
mother," says Madame Royale, "apologising for the wretches who had
condemned him.He told her that he would not consent to any attempt to
save him, which might excite disturbance in the country.He then gave my
brother some religious advice, and desired him, above all, to forgive
those who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing.My mother was
very desirous that the whole family should pass the night with my father,
but he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed some hours of
repose and quiet."After a long conversation, interrupted by silence and
grief, the King put an end to the painful meeting, agreeing to see his
family again at eight the next morning."Yes, yes," sorrowfully replied the
King.["But when we were gone," says his daughter, "he requested that we might
not be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too much."]At this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the
other, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin
stood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.At the moment of
retiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King
returned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.The
King retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon a
bed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,
and dressed with great calmness.He congratulated himself on having
recovered his strength by sleep.Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a chest
of drawers, out of which he formed an altar.M. Edgeworth put on his
pontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.Clery waited on him, and
the King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.He then received
the communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass rose with new
vigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to the scaffold.He asked for scissors that Clery might cut his hair; but the Commune
refused to trust him with a pair.At this moment the drums were beating in the capital.All who belonged to
the armed sections repaired to their company with complete submission.It
was reported that four or five hundred devoted men, were to make a dash
upon the carriage, and rescue the King.The Convention, the Commune, the
Executive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.in the
morning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the department, and
the criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.Louis XVI., on hearing
them arrive, rose and prepared to depart.He desired Clery to transmit
his last farewell to his wife, his sister, and his children; he gave him a
sealed packet, hair, and various trinkets, with directions to deliver
these articles to them.[In the course of the morning the King said to me: "You will give this
seal to my son and this ring to the Queen, and assure her that it is with
pain I part with it.This little packet contains the hair of all my
family; you will give her that, too.Tell the Queen, my dear sister, and
my children, that, although I promised to see them again this morning, I
have resolved to spare them the pang of so cruel a separation.Tell them
how much it costs me to go away without receiving their embraces once
more!"He wiped away some tears, and then added, in the most mournful
accents, "I charge you to bear them my last farewell."--CLERY.]He then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.After this he
addressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to
transmit his last will to the Commune.This officer, who had formerly
been a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his
business was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his
commissions.Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning towards
the party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.Officers of gendarmerie were placed on the front seat of the carriage.The
King and M. Edgeworth occupied the back.During the ride, which was
rather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth's breviary the prayers for
persons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his
piety and tranquil resignation.The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst
universal silence.At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had
been left vacant about the scaffold.Around this space were planted
cannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the
scaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and
misfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks
of the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of
satisfaction.Louis XVI., rising briskly,
stepped out into the Place.Three executioners came up; he refused their
assistance, and took off his clothes himself.But, perceiving that they
were going to bind his hands, he made a movement of indignation, and
seemed ready to resist.M. Edgeworth gave him a last look, and said,
"Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God who is about to be
your reward."At these words the King suffered himself to be bound and
conducted to the scaffold.All at once Louis hurriedly advanced to
address the people."Frenchmen," said he, in a firm voice, "I die
innocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I forgive the authors of
my death, and I pray that my blood may not fall upon France."He would
have continued, but the drums were instantly ordered to beat: their
rolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid hold of him, and M.
Edgeworth took his leave in these memorable words: "Son of Saint Louis,
ascend to heaven!"As soon as the blood flowed, furious wretches dipped
their pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then dispersed throughout Paris,
shouting "Vive la Republique!and even went to the
gates of the Temple to display brutal and factious joy.[The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to the
ancient cemetery of the Madeleine.Large quantities of quicklime were
thrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a decomposition that,
when his remains were sought for in 1816, it was with difficulty any part
could be recovered.Over the spot where he was interred Napoleon
commenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after the battle of Jena; and the
superb edifice was completed by the Bourbons, and now forms the Church of
the Madeleine, the most beautiful structure in Paris.Louis was executed
on the same ground where the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, and so many other
noble victims of the Revolution perished; where Robespierre and Danton
afterwards suffered; and where the Emperor Alexander and the allied
sovereigns took their station, when their victorious troops entered Paris
in 1814!The history of modern Europe has not a scene fraught with
equally interesting recollections to exhibit.It is now marked by the
colossal obelisk of blood-red granite which was brought from Thebes, in
Upper Egypt, in 1833, by the French Government.--ALLISON.]The Royal Prisoners.--Separation of the Dauphin from His Family.On the morning of the King's execution, according to the narrative of
Madame Royale, his family rose at six: "The night before, my mother had
scarcely strength enough to put my brother to bed; She threw herself,
dressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with cold
and grief all night long.At a quarter-past six the door opened; we
believed that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers
looking for a prayer-book for him.We did not, however, abandon the hope
of seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us
that all was over.In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who
probably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would occasion
a burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and choking agony
in which we saw her."The request was refused, and the officers who
brought the refusal said Clery was in "a frightful state of despair" at
not being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards he was
dismissed from the Temple."We had now a little more freedom," continues the Princess; "our guards
even believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing
could calm my mother's agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or
death became indifferent to her.Fortunately my own affliction increased
my illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts.My
mother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed the
door of what had been my father's room, and that she could not bear.But
fearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,
about the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of the
Tower, and it was granted."The Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these sad
promenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed from
the neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the battlements
should be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the view.But while
the rules for the Queen's captivity were again made more strict, some of
the municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate it, and by means
of M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the faithful Turgi, who
remained in the Tower, some communications passed between the royal family
and their friends.The wife of Tison, who waited on the Queen, suspected
and finally denounced these more lenient guardians,--[Toulan, Lepitre,
Vincent, Bruno, and others.]--who were executed, the royal prisoners being
subjected to a close examination."On the 20th of April," says Madame Royale, "my mother and I had just gone
to bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.We got up hastily,
and these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we should be
searched.My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his bed under
the pretext of examining it.My mother took him up, shivering with cold.All they took was a shopkeeper's card which my mother had happened to
keep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me 'une sacre coeur de
Jesus' and a prayer for the welfare of France.The search lasted from
half-past ten at night till four o'clock in the morning."The next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found
in her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and
which she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.They took it from her
in spite of her entreaties."It was suspicious," said the cruel and
contemptible tyrants.The Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother, who
watched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for him.When Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved the
most violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, "his health was never
reestablished.Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well
as the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age
passed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety
and agony."While the Dauphin's health was causing his family such alarm, they were
deprived of the services of Tison's wife, who became ill, and finally
insane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were reported
to the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the royal
prisoners.[This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at the
feet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple for many
days with the sight and the noise of her madness.The Princesses,
forgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being, in consideration
of her repentance and insanity, watched over her by turns, and deprived
themselves of their own food to relieve her.--LAMARTINE, "History of the
Girondists," vol.No woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,
swept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.Far worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.On 3d July
a decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be separated
from his family and "placed in the most secure apartment of the Tower."As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, "he threw
himself into my mother's arms, and with violent cries entreated not to be
parted from her.My mother would not let her son go, and she actually
defended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which she had
placed him.The men threatened to call up the guard and use violence.My
mother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear her child from
her.At last they threatened our lives, and my mother's maternal
tenderness forced her to the sacrifice.My aunt and I dressed the child,
for my poor mother had no longer strength for anything.Nevertheless, when
he was dressed, she took him up in her arms and delivered him herself to
the officers, bathing him with her tears, foreseeing that she was never to
behold him again.The poor little fellow embraced us all tenderly, and
was carried away in a flood of tears.My mother's horror was extreme when
she heard that Simon, a shoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a
municipal officer in the Temple, was the person to whom her child was
confided.The officers now no longer remained in my mother's
apartment; they only came three times a day to bring our meals and examine
the bolts and bars of our windows; we were locked up together night and
day.We often went up to the Tower, because my brother went, too, from
the other side.The only pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him
through a crevice as he passed at a distance.She would watch for hours
together to see him as he passed.It was her only hope, her only
thought."The Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.On 1st
August, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.Robespierre
opposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted hatred
of the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to
eradicate."Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?""Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the
Austrian?The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the
Republic..but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of
all the disasters of France."At two o'clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal officers
"awoke us," says Madame Royale, "to read to my mother the decree of the
Convention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,

[The Conciergerie was originally, as its name implies, the porter's lodge
of the ancient Palace of Justice, and became in time a prison, from the
custom of confining there persons who had committed trifling offences
about the Court.]She heard it without visible emotion, and
without speaking a single word.My aunt and I immediately asked to be
allowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.All the
time my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these
officers never left her.She was even obliged to dress herself before
them, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they
contained.She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my
courage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.She then threw herself into my aunt's arms, and recommended her children
to her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then hurried
away.In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the wicket, not
having stooped low enough.[Mathieu, the gaoler, used to say, "I make Madame Veto and her sister and
daughter, proud though they are, salute me; for the door is so low they
cannot pass without bowing."]'No,' she replied,
'nothing can hurt me now."We have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.Marie
Antoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,
by virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last
members of the family of the Bourbons.She had been removed to the
Conciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to what
was strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.The imprudence of a
devoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.Michonnis, a
member of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm interest, was
desirous of introducing to her a person who, he said, wished to see her
out of curiosity.This man, a courageous emigrant, threw to her a
carnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper with these
words: "Your friends are ready,"--false hope, and equally dangerous for
her who received it, and for him who gave it!Michonnis and the emigrant
were detected and forthwith apprehended; and the vigilance exercised in
regard to the unfortunate prisoner became from that day more rigorous than
ever.[The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which was
considered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie on
account of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was continually
affected.Under pretence of giving her a person to wait upon her they
placed near her a spy,--a man of a horrible countenance and hollow,
sepulchral voice.This wretch, whose name was Barassin, was a robber and
murderer by profession.Such was the chosen attendant on the Queen of
France!A few days before her trial this wretch was removed and a
gendarme placed in her chamber, who watched over her night and day, and
from whom she was not separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged
curtain.In this melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress
than an old black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend
every day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.--DU  BROCA.]Gendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and
they were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to
them.That wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting
paper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,
Varlet, and Leclerc were the leaders--Hebert had made it his particular
business to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family.He
asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated than
any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed by
which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were
maintained was to be suppressed.They were no longer to be allowed either
poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for breakfast,
and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two dishes for
supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.Tallow candles were to be
furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft ware
instead of porcelain.The wood and water carriers alone were permitted to
enter their room, and that only accompanied by two commissioners.Their
food was to be introduced to them by means of a turning box.The numerous
establishment was reduced to a cook and an assistant, two men-servants,
and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple
and inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most
trifling articles to which they attached a high value.Eighty Louis which
Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from Madame de
Lamballe, were also taken away.No one is more dangerous, more cruel,
than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with a
recent authority.If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like
Hebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money
out of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap
all at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he
is atrocious.Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.He did not
confine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.He and some
others conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt and
sister.A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to whom
it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a
sans-cullotte education.Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,
and, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to bring
him up in their own way.Their food was better than that of the
Princesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who
were on duty.Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two
commissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the
Dauphin a little exercise.Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations
to criminate his unhappy mother.Whether this wretch imputed to the child
false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to extort
from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a revolting
deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being
brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous
particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her
judges.Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable
revolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of
acquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had
brought her before it.It was necessary, however, to make some charges.Fouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever
since the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of
accusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for
her pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,
the Emperor.He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October, and
on the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that period
framed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to frustrate
it.He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband, interfered
in the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the deputies
gained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked the war,
and transmitted to the enemy's generals all our plans of campaign.He
further accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on the 10th of
August, of having on that day caused the people to be fired upon, having
induced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with cowardice;
lastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with foreigners
since her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated her young
son as King.We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-deferred
vengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such of their
princes as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted and
converted into crime.We see how the profusion and fondness for pleasure,
so natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her native country,
her influence over her husband, her regrets, always more indiscreet in a
woman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared to their inflamed
or malignant imaginations.Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,
who had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who
had frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial
offices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..
Admiral d'Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles; Manuel,
the ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war in 1789;
the venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La Fayette, an
accomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of the
Girondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons and
compelled to give evidence.Some had seen the Queen in high spirits
when the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her vexed
and dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from
Varennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have
cost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices
that the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.An ancient
waiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that
the Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make
war upon the Turks.The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at
length to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.He said that
Charles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and
mentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.He then added
that this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for his age;
that he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him, learned that
he derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.Hebert said
that it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by weakening thus,
early the physical constitution of her son, to secure to herself the means
of ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.The rumours which
had been whispered for twenty years by a malicious Court had given the
people a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of the Queen.That
audience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted at the accusations
of Hebert.[Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.Queen
by Hdbert,--namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with her own
son?He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted in order to
prejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent her execution from
exciting pity.It had, however, no other effect than that of disgusting
all parties.--PRUDHOMME.][Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken such an
infamous part.He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]Urged a new to explain herself, she
said, with extraordinary emotion, "I thought that human nature would
excuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the
heart of every mother here present."This noble and simple reply affected
all who heard it.In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for
Marie Antoinette.The brave D'Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would
not say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which she
had shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution which
she had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.Manuel, in
spite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the Legislative
Assembly, declared that he could not say anything against the accused.When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so often
predicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must produce,
he appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew the wife
of Capet, "Yes," said he, bowing respectfully, "I have known Madame."He
declared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the declarations
extorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to Varennes were
false.In recompense for his deposition he was assailed with outrageous
reproaches, from which he might judge what fate would soon be awarded to
himself.In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by
Latour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help
it.Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for
an accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.Valaze,
always cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say anything to
criminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that, as a member
of the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his colleagues to
examine the papers found at the house of Septeuil, treasurer of the civil
list, he had seen bonds for various sums signed Antoinette, which was very
natural; but he added that he had also seen a letter in which the minister
requested the King to transmit to the Queen the copy of the plan of
campaign which he had in his hands.The most unfavourable construction
was immediately put upon these two facts, the application for a statement
of the armies, and the communication of the plan of campaign; and it was
concluded that they could not be wanted for any other purpose than to be
sent to the enemy, for it was not supposed that a young princess should
turn her attention, merely for her own satisfaction, to matters of
administration and military, plans.After these depositions, several
others were received respecting the expenses of the Court, the influence
of the Queen in public affairs, the scene of the 10th of August, and what
had passed in the Temple; and the most vague rumours and most trivial
circumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.Marie Antoinette frequently repeated, with presence of mind and firmness,
that there was no precise fact against her;

[At first the Queen, consulting only her own sense of dignity, had
resolved on her trial to make no other reply to the questions of her
judges than "Assassinate me as you have already assassinated my husband!"Afterwards, however, she determined to follow the example of the King,
exert herself in her defence, and leave her judges without any excuse or
pretest for putting her to death.--WEBER'S "Memoirs of Marie Antoinette."]that, besides, though the wife of Louis XVI., she was not answerable for
any of the acts of his reign.Fouquier nevertheless declared her to be
sufficiently convicted; Chaveau-Lagarde made unavailing efforts to defend
her; and the unfortunate Queen was condemned to suffer the same fate as
her husband.Conveyed back to the Conciergerie, she there passed in tolerable composure
the night preceding her execution, and, on the morning of the following
day, the 16th of October,

[The Queen, after having written and prayed, slept soundly for some hours.On her waking, Bault's daughter dressed her and adjusted her hair with
more neatness than on other days.Marie Antoinette wore a white gown, a
white handkerchief covered her shoulders, a white cap her hair; a black
ribbon bound this cap round her temples....  The cries, the looks, the
laughter, the jests of the people overwhelmed her with humiliation; her
colour, changing continually from purple to paleness, betrayed her
agitation....  On reaching the scaffold she inadvertently trod on the
executioner's foot."Pardon me," she said, courteously.She knelt for an
instant and uttered a half-audible prayer; then rising and glancing
towards the towers of the Temple, "Adieu, once again, my children," she
said; "I go to rejoin your father."--LAMARTINE.]she was conducted, amidst a great concourse of the populace, to the fatal
spot where, ten months before, Louis XVI.She listened
with calmness to the exhortations of the ecclesiastic who accompanied her,
and cast an indifferent look at the people who had so often applauded her
beauty and her grace, and who now as warmly applauded her execution.On
reaching the foot of the scaffold she perceived the Tuileries, and
appeared to be moved; but she hastened to ascend the fatal ladder, and
gave herself up with courage to the executioner.[Sorrow had blanched the Queen's once beautiful hair; but her features and
air still commanded the admiration of all who beheld her; her cheeks, pale
and emaciated, were occasionally tinged with a vivid colour at the mention
of those she had lost.When led out to execution, she was dressed in
white; she had cut off her hair with her own hands.Placed in a tumbrel,
with her arms tied behind her, she was taken by a circuitous route to the
Place de la Revolution, and she ascended the scaffold with a firm and
dignified step, as if she had been about to take her place on a throne by
the side of her husband.-LACRETELLE.]The infamous wretch exhibited her head to the people, as he was accustomed
to do when he had sacrificed an illustrious victim.The Last Separation.--Execution of Madame Elisabeth.The two Princesses left in the Temple were now almost inconsolable; they
spent days and nights in tears, whose only alleviation was that they were
shed together."The company of my aunt, whom I loved so tenderly," said
Madame Royale, "was a great comfort to me.all that I loved
was perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also.In
the beginning of September I had an illness caused solely by my anxiety
about my mother; I never heard a drum beat that I did not expect another
3d of September."--[when the head of the Princesse de Lamballe was carried
to the Temple.]In the course of the month the rigour of their captivity was much
increased.The Commune ordered that they should only have one room; that
Tison (who had done the heaviest of the household work for them, and since
the kindness they showed to his insane wife had occasionally given them
tidings of the Dauphin) should be imprisoned in the turret; that they
should be supplied with only the barest necessaries; and that no one
should enter their room save to carry water and firewood.Their quantity
of firing was reduced, and they were not allowed candles.They were also
forbidden to go on the leads, and their large sheets were taken away,
"lest--notwithstanding the gratings!--they should escape from the
windows."On 8th October, 1793, Madame Royale was ordered to go downstairs, that she
might be interrogated by some municipal officers."My aunt, who was
greatly affected, would have followed, but they stopped her.She asked
whether I should be permitted to come up again; Chaumette assured her that
I should.'You may trust,' said he, 'the word of an honest republican.I soon found myself in my brother's room, whom I
embraced tenderly; but we were torn asunder, and I was obliged to go into
another room.--[This was the last time the brother and sister met].Chaumette then questioned me about a thousand shocking things of which
they accused my mother and aunt; I was so indignant at hearing such
horrors that, terrified as I was, I could not help exclaiming that they
were infamous falsehoods."But in spite of my tears they still pressed their questions.There were
some things which I did not comprehend, but of which I understood enough
to make me weep with indignation and horror.They then asked me
about Varennes, and other things.I answered as well as I could without
implicating anybody.I had always heard my parents say that it were
better to die than to implicate anybody."When the examination was over
the Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette said
he could not obtain permission for her to do so.She was then cautioned
to say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next to appear
before them.Madame Elisabeth, her niece declares, "replied with still
more contempt to their shocking questions."The only intimation of the Queen's fate which her daughter and her
sister-in-law were allowed to receive was through hearing her sentence
cried by the newsman.But "we could not persuade ourselves that she was
dead," writes Madame Royale."A hope, so natural to the unfortunate,
persuaded us that she must have been saved.For eighteen months I
remained in this cruel suspense.We learnt also by the cries of the
newsman the death of the Duc d'Orleans.[The Duc d'Orleans, the early and interested propagator of the Revolution,
was its next victim.Billaud Varennes said in the Convention: "The time
has come when all the conspirators should be known and struck.I demand
that we no longer pass over in silence a man whom we seem to have
forgotten, despite the numerous facts against him.I demand that
D'ORLEANS be sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal."The Convention, once
his hireling adulators, unanimously supported the proposal.In vain he
alleged his having been accessory to the disorders of 5th October, his
support of the revolt on 10th August, 1792, his vote against the King on
17th January, 1793.He then asked only
for a delay of twenty-four hours, and had a repast carefully prepared, on
which he feasted with avidity.When led out for execution he gazed with a
smile on the Palais Royal, the scene of his former orgies.He was detained
for a quarter of an hour before that palace by the order of Robespierre,
who had asked his daughter's hand, and promised in return to excite a
tumult in which the Duke's life should be saved.Depraved though he was,
he would not consent to such a sacrifice, and he met his fate with stoical
fortitude.--ALLISON, vol.It was the only piece of news that reached us during the whole winter."The severity with which the prisoners were treated was carried into every
detail of their life.The officers who guarded them took away their
chessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and
all the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment for
a gathering on Madame Elisabeth's arm; they, would not allow her to make a
herb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they declined to
supply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing only coarse fat
meat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, "None but fools believe
in that stuff nowadays."Madame Elisabeth never made the officials
another request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-au-lait from her
breakfast for her second meal.The time during which she could be thus
tormented was growing short.On 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts
of the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard."When my aunt
was dressed," says Madame Royale, "she opened the door, and they said to
her, 'Citoyenne, come down.'--'We shall take care of her
afterwards.'She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to return.'No, citoyenne,' said the men, 'bring your bonnet; you shall not return.'They overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently, embracing me,
and exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget the last commands
of my father and mother."Madame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was
interrogated by the vice-president at midnight, and then allowed to take
some hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the
last time.In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with
twenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom
had once been frequently seen at Court."Of what has Elisabeth to complain?"Fouquier-Tinville satirically asked."At the foot of the guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility, she may
imagine herself again at Versailles.""You call my brother a tyrant," the Princess replied to her accuser; "if
he had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before
you!"She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief."I am
ready to die," she said, "happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better
world those whom I loved on earth."On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same
time as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and
resignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and
courage like her own.The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace
her, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted
the scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions
had been executed before her eyes.[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant
intervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety
in the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and
the admiration of the world....  When I went to Versailles Madame
Elisabeth was twenty-two years of age.Her plump figure and pretty pink
colour must have attracted notice, and her air of calmness and contentment
even more than her beauty.She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and
courage in riding were remarkable.But she never allowed these amusements
to interfere with her religious observances.At that time her wish to
take the veil at St.Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too fond of
his sister to endure the separation.There were also rumours of a
marriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor Joseph.The Queen was
sincerely attached to her brother, and loved her sister-in-law most
tenderly; she ardently desired this marriage as a means of raising the
Princess to one of the first thrones in Europe, and as a possible means of
turning the Emperor from his innovations.She had been very carefully
educated, had talent in music and painting, spoke Italian and a little
Latin, and understood mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her
courage and virtue.--D'HEZECQUES's "Recollections," pp."It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from
my aunt," says Madame Royale."Since I had been able to appreciate her
merits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,
and a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,
since nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.I never can
be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only
with her life.She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved
her as a second mother.I was thought to be very like her in countenance,
and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.Would to God
I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet
her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I
cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and
meritorious deaths."Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her
aunt, or at least to know their fate.The municipal officers would tell
her nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with
her."I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often
harshly refused," she says."But I at least could keep myself clean.I
had soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.I had no
light, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much.I had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.I
had also some knitting, 'qui m'ennuyait beaucoup'."Once, she believes,
Robespierre visited her prison:

[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of
Mademoiselle d'Orleans.It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself
owed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]"The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not
know him, or at least would not tell me who he was.He stared insolently
at me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a
search, retired."[On another occasion "three men in scarfs," who entered the Princess's
room, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,
as she seemed very comfortable!"It is dreadful,' I replied, 'to be
separated for more than a year from one's mother, without even hearing
what has become of her or of my aunt.'--'No, monsieur,
but the cruellest illness is that of the heart'--' We can do nothing for
you.Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French
people: I had nothing more to say."--DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME, "Royal
Memoirs," p.When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young
prisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration."He was
always courteous," she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh
books, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, "which
pleased me greatly."This simple expression of relief gives a clearer
idea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of
complaints.But however hard Madame Royale's lot might be, that of the Dauphin was
infinitely harder.Though only eight years old when he entered the
Temple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; "his memory
retained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything."His
features "recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the
Austrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated
nostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the
middle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother
before her years of tears and torture.All the beauty of his race, by
both descents, seemed to reappear in him."--[Lamartine]--For some time the
care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the
Temple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his
sister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain
strength."What does the Convention intend to do with him?"asked Simon, when the
innocent victim was placed in his clutches.For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better."Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his
youthful glory and his mother's pride.This worthy pair stripped him of
the mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it
'playing at the game of the spoiled king.'They alternately induced him
to commit excesses, and then half starved him.They beat him mercilessly;
nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.As soon as
the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly
call him by name, 'Capet!Startled, nervous, bathed in
perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush
through the dark, and present himself at Simon's bedside, murmuring,
tremblingly, 'I am here, citizen.'--'Come nearer; let me feel you.'He
would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment
that awaited him.Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,
adding the remark, 'Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know
that you were safe.'On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen
half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and
faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, 'Suppose you were king,
Capet, what would you do to me?'The child thought of his father's dying
words, and said, 'I would forgive you.'"--[THIERS]

The change in the young Prince's mode of life, and the cruelties and
caprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his
sister."Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities
of wine, which he detested.He grew extremely fat without
increasing in height or strength."His aunt and sister, deprived of the
pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised
in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.The brutality of Simon
"depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.He called him the young
wolf of the Temple.He treated him as the young of wild animals are
treated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once
intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.He punished for
sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child
wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted
towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it."[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.He was involved in
the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th
July, 1794.]Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince's condition became even
worse.His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any
suffering would have been preferable."He passed his days without any
kind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.His
keepers never approached him but to give him food;" and on the rare
occasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable
or unwilling to move about.When, in November, 1794, a commissary named
Gomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with
kindness, it was too late."He took extreme care of my brother," says
Madame Royale."For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in
darkness, and he was dying of fright.He was very grateful for the
attentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him."But his physical
condition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin's representations, a
commission was instituted to examine him."The commissioners appointed
were Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited 'Louis Charles,' as he
was now called, in the month of February, 1795.They found the young
Prince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some
dirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been
furnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences
of indulgence.He did not look up from the table as the commissioners
entered.He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was
reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes
were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is
well known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left
his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it
was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and
with sores.The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable
him from walking.One of the commissioners approached the young Prince
respectfully.Harmond in a kind voice
begged him to speak to them.The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the
table before him.They told him of the kindly intentions of the
Government, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire
that he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.He seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed
his lips.It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart
to maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.He remembered
too well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him
with pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation
against the mother that he loved.He had learnt by some means the import
of the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.He now dreaded
seeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being
treated again with fine promises.Dumb as death itself he sat before
them, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute."[THIERS]

His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents
of the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the
melancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: "Little
Capet is unwell."No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed
next day in more urgent terms: "Little Capet is dangerously ill."Still
there was no word from beyond the walls."We must knock harder," said the
keepers to each other, and they added, "It is feared he will not live," to
the words "dangerously ill."At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,
three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to
give the invalid the assistance of his art.After having written down his
name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.He made a long and
very attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many
questions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself
with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every
half-hour, from six o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening.On
the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.In vain Gomin
several times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example
proved as ineffectual as his words.Next day Lasne renewed his
solicitations."Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the
good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take
what might contribute to it.I entreat him as a favour not to give me
this cause of grief."And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the
potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands."You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it," said he, firmly;
"well, give it me, I will drink it."From that moment he conformed with
docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune
had attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a
mockery to supply it.The Prince's weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him
to the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step
he stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.At
last he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,
and his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes
in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.But the
slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely
compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.On the battlement of
the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance
through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.The water that fell remained
there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of
frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly
supplied.Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a
little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this
reservoir.At first they flew away at his approach, but from being
accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew
more familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up
close to them.They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and
perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.He
called them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the
terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were
always there.He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied
them their wings.Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral
improvement was taking place in him.He was touched by the lively
interest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine
o'clock every morning.He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and
ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.Gratitude loosened his
tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind
treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them
to express his thanks.M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the
officers of the municipality would permit.When they announced the close
of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,
held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.Suddenly M. Desault's
visits ceased.Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.The
keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much
distressed at it.The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it
would be proper to send to the physician's house to make inquiries as to
the cause of so long an absence.Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to
follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,
who, hearing M. Desault's name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,
"You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday."M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next
directed to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a
state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the
responsibility alone.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the
dying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned
beforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed
the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise
of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,
which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last
mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said
authoritatively to the municipal on duty, "If you will not take these
bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our
carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to
take charge of him."The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken
as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come
nearer."Speak lower, I beg of you," said he; "I am afraid they will hear
you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,
as it would give them much uneasiness."At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and
gave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.
Pelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a
colleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made
his appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the
official despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They
repaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard
that the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,
which had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about
nine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they
perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out
by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to
soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the
Prince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him."My dear
mother remains in the other tower."Night came,--his last night,--which
the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,
with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,
death, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room
on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and
mute:

"I hope you are not in pain just now?""Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so
beautiful!"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, "From what direction do you hear this
music?"And the
child, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his
large eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy
this last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,
in intense rapture, "Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of
my mother!"At a quarter past two he died, Lasne
only being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,
the commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber
of death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into
that where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never
ceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the
scaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains
were laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set
open,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had
seized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of
general safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really
dead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont
they affected the greatest indifference."The event is not of the least
importance," they repeated, several times over; "the police commissary of
the section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will
acknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the
committee will give the necessary directions."As they withdrew, some
officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass
without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those
coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child's
death.All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them
if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of
France.Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the
Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis
XVII.When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the
minutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.These minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was
afterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the
outer gate of the Temple.These were Dumangin, head physician of the
Hospice de l'Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de
l'Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and
Laasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.The
last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former
connection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with
the House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the
National Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the
minutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up
again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis
XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.
Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little
favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries
prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse
was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,
and that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the
longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy
and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took
place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before
the gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the
coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;
but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the
arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the
procession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing
round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured
ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.Compassion and sorrow were
impressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,
sent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,
still covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of
four men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or
eight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long
way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the
cemetery.The name of "Little Capet," and the more popular title of
Dauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as
some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment
was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet
from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,
which subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound
marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!Not
till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,
and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of
interment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for
whom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's
death the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed
to walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of
the old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several
times evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths
of her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had
much difficulty in expressing her feelings."She spoke so confusedly,"
says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, "that it was
difficult to understand her.It took her more than a month's reading
aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself
intelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression."She was
dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured
by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed
to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave
off.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with
a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not
like to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered
herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and
ascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great
changes about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded
for the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to
pray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed
this example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a
condition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be
allowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that
Madame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and
ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,
Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th
December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from
prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting
public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the
Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made
it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her
brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the
frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of
France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named
Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale
reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds
were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.was the only one of all his
family who had no dogs in his room.I remember one day waiting in the
great gallery for the King's retiring, when he entered with all his family
and the whole pack, who were escorting him.All at once all the dogs
began to bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts
along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.The
Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after them,
completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august persons very
merry.--D'HEZECQUES, p.She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with
marks of pleasure and respect.It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave
behind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and
such bitter suffering.But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves
of all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around
her, "I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it
my country."She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first
care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.After
many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,
and people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of
seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such
terrible storms had swept.The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke
Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,
destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d'Angouleme, son of the Comte
d'Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to
persecution.Every effort was made to alienate her from her French
relations.She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if
Louis XVIII.A pressure of opinion
was brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a
girl."I was sent for to the Emperor's cabinet," she writes, "where I
found the imperial family assembled.The ministers and chief imperial
counsellors were also present.When the Emperor invited me to
express my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such
interests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother's
relatives, but also by those of my father.Besides, I said, I
was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of
France, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my
father, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield
obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.This declaration
appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they
observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being
independent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle
to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation
of my interests."In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial
relations suppressed her French title as much as possible.When, with
some difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of
her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade
him beware."Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de
Lorraine," she said, "for here I am so identified with these
provinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis
XVIII.]--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation."After
these discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were
imposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old
days of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.Rescue,
however, was at hand.accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the
Czar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest's first request,
whatever it might be.Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the
Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him."Monsieur, my brother,"
was Paul's answer, "Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall
cease to be Paul I."Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna
with a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must
have been followed by war.Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was
allowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.and his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d'Angouleme

[The Duc d'Angonleme was quiet and reserved.He loved hunting as means of
killing time; was given to early hours and innocent pleasures.He was a
gentleman, and brave as became one.He had not the "gentlemanly vices" of
his brother, and was all the better for it.He was ill educated, but had
natural good sense, and would have passed for having more than that had he
cared to put forth pretensions.Of all his family he was the one most ill
spoken of, and least deserving of it.--DOCTOR DORAN.]and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief
ecclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.With
them were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more
welcome to Madame Royale,--De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis
XVI.during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the
Princesses in the Temple.It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously
desired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad
wedding,--exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,
fulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on
family policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and
bridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.During the eighteen months of
tranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation
of the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.In January, 1801, the
Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just then
the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal family
to leave Mittau.Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of bitter
memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a
crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them
on their way.The Duc d'Angouleme took another route
to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his
dominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully
surprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the
body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of
Paul.The "mad Czar" had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,
penniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.All
the money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful
servants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess
offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand
ducats, saying she pledged her property "that in our common distress it
may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and
myself."The Duchess's consistent and unselfish kindness procured her
from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of "our
angel."Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there
they were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon's attempt to threaten and bribe
Louis XVIII.It was suggested that refusal might bring
upon them expulsion from Prussia."We are accustomed to suffering," was
the King's answer, "and we do not dread poverty.I would, trusting in
God, seek another asylum."In 1808, after many changes of scene, this
asylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their
disposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.From Gosfield, the King moved to
Hartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee
for L 500 a year.A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled
family by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons
were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst
the poor.In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked
the notice of strangers.In March, 1814, the royalist successes at
Bordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and
amidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself
to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left
Hartwell in April, 1814.The return to France was as triumphant as a
somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of
such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.As she
passed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously
greeted.The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than
the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected
one of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what
remained of her parents' bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which
they were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.Denis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered
the royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc
d'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a
Swedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de
Conde withdrew beyond the frontier.The
Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the
Proclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand
against the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and
reviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate
appeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a
handful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops
were on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against
the square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.["It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you," said the gallant General
Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; "I could not bring
myself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was
providing material for the noblest page in her history."--"Fillia
Dolorosa," vol.With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;
Napoleon's banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a
farewell proclamation to her "brave Bordelais," and on the 1st April,
1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a
brief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was
over, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the
Tuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State
ceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position
would allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been
inhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of
her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and
prayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the
spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule
all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she
refrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,
that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from
the letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might
be melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family "passing rich
with forty pounds a year."--See "Filia Dolorosa," vol.Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.The
few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her
pleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.She
is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no
influence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and "the
very word liberty made her shudder;" like Madame Roland, she had seen "so
many crimes perpetrated under that name."The claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor
of St.Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or
Norndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a
moment obtained her sanction.Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to
number a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.In February,1820, a
fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de
Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Angouleme, as he was seeing his
wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.He was carried
into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by
the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when
he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St.She was present also when
his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a
guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.In September, 1824, she
stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief
occupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who
generally resided with her at Villeneuve l'Etang, her country house near
St.Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,
stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the
evening of the 27th.She was received with "a roar of execrations and
seditious cries," and knew only too well what they signified.She
instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received
news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven
to Joigny with three attendants.Soon after leaving that place it was
thought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,
and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered
Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.The Duchess found
him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her
with a request for "pardon," being fully conscious, too late, that his
unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his
family.The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty
passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.
being proclaimed King, and the Duc d'Orleans (who refused to take the boy
monarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.Then began the Duchess's third expatriation.At Cherbourg the royal
family, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the
'Great Britain', which stood out to sea.The Duchess, remaining on deck
for a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she
thought, suspiciously near them."To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be
made to return to France."Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.The
fugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of
Comtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her
son, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till
his death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by
his enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy
associations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse
d'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by
land, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea."I prefer my route
to that of my sister," observed the latter, "because I shall see the coast
of France again, and she will not."The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were
still too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,
with his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse
d'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at
Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated
with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to
congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of
monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years
later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor
Francis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to
be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned
monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow
attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were
established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of
cholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,
the Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched
over that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in
youth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent
shared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very
closely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,
riding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her
husband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,
she, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they
spent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as "Queen" by her
household for the first time in her life, but she herself always
recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived
to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of
her family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service
held for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the
anniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;
on the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,
and on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,
was buried in the Franciscan convent."In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was
present because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a
French heart.had long been admitted to be one of
the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon
never spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and
always prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to
which I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of
Prussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot
on which Louis XVI.I went to see the
ceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,
next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande."The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely
fine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,
accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance
of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor
Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.There was a long
parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands
vied with each other in playing the air, 'Vive Henri IV.!'The cavalry
defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry
ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the
Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen
steps.The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by
the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince
Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.When the Emperor had nearly
reached the altar the "Te Deum" commenced.At the moment of the
benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as
the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed
it; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,
though they were not of the Greek faith.On rising, the Grand Duke
Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were
heard."The following titles have the signification given below during the period
covered by this work:

did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

31.ALL AFLOAT
     By William Wood.THE RAILWAY BUILDERS
     By Oscar D. Skelton.One of the night marauders of his
clan chanced in an evil hour to see Connor O’Rourke guiding his coracle
to the island, and at the same time a cloaked female push cautiously
from the opposite shore for the same spot.Surprised, he crouched among
the fern till their landing and joyous greeting put all doubt of their
friendly understanding to flight; and then, thinking only of revenge or
ransom, the unsentimental scoundrel hurried round the lake to M’Diarmod,
and informed him that the son of his mortal foe was within his reach.The old man leaped from his couch of rushes at the thrilling news, and,
standing on his threshold, uttered a low gathering-cry, which speedily
brought a dozen of his more immediate retainers to his presence.As he
passed his daughter’s apartment, he for the first time asked himself who
can the woman be?and at the same moment almost casually glanced at
Norah’s chamber, to see that all there was quiet for the night.A shudder
of vague terror ran through his sturdy frame as his eye fell on the low
open window.He thrust in his head, but no sleeper drew breath within; he
re-entered the house and called aloud upon his daughter, but the echo of
her name was the only answer.A kern coming up put an end to the search,
by telling that he had seen his young mistress walking down to the
water’s edge about an hour before, but that, as she had been in the habit
of doing so by night for some time past, he had thought but little of it.The odious truth was now revealed, and, trembling with the sudden gust of
fury, the old chief with difficulty rushed to the lake, and, filling a
couple of boats with his men, told them to pull for the honour of their
name and for the head of the O’Rourke’s first-born.During this stormy prelude to a bloody drama, the doomed but unconscious
Connor was sitting secure within the dilapidated chapel by the side
of her whom he had won.Her quickened ear first caught the dip of an
oar, and she told her lover; but he said it was the moaning of the
night-breeze through the willows, or the ripple of the water among the
stones, and went on with his gentle dalliance.A few minutes, however,
and the shock of the keels upon the ground, the tread of many feet, and
the no longer suppressed cries of the M’Diarmods, warned him to stand on
his defence; and as he sprang from his seat to meet the call, the soft
illumination of love was changed with fearful suddenness into the baleful
fire of fierce hostility.“My Norah, leave me; you may by chance be rudely handled in the scuffle.”

The terrified but faithful girl fell upon his breast.“Connor, your fate is mine; hasten to your boat, if it be not yet too
late.”

An iron-shod hunting pole was his only weapon; and using it with his
right arm, while Norah hung upon his left, he sprang without further
parley through an aperture in the wall, and made for the water.But his
assailants were upon him, the M’Diarmod himself with upraised battle-axe
at their head.“Spare my father,” faltered Norah; and Connor, with a mercifully
directed stroke, only dashed the weapon from the old man’s hand, and
then, clearing a passage with a vigorous sweep, accompanied with the
well-known charging cry, before which they had so often quailed, bounded
through it to the water’s brink.An instant, and with her who was now
more than his second self, he was once more in his little boat; but,
alas!it was aground, and so quickly fell the blows against him, that he
dare not adventure to shove it off.Letting Norah slip from his hold,
she sank backwards to the bottom of the boat; and then, with both arms
free, he redoubled his efforts, and after a short but furious struggle
succeeded in getting the little skiff afloat.Maddened at the sight, the
old chief rushed breast-deep into the water; but his right arm had been
disabled by a casual blow, and his disheartened followers feared, under
the circumstances, to come within range of that well-wielded club.But
a crafty one among them had already seized on a safer and surer plan.He had clambered up an adjacent tree, armed with a heavy stone, and now
stood on one of the branches above the devoted boat, and summoned him to
yield, if he would not perish.The young chief’s renewed exertions were
his only answer.“Let him escape, and your head shall pay for it,” shouted the infuriated
father.“My young mistress?”

“There are enough here to save her, if I will it.Down with the stone, or
by the blood----”

He needed not to finish the sentence, for down at the word it came,
striking helpless the youth’s right arm, and shivering the frail timber
of the boat, which filled at once, and all went down.For an instant
an arm re-appeared, feebly beating the water in vain--it was the young
chief’s broken one: the other held his Norah in its embrace, as was seen
by her white dress flaunting for a few moments on and above the troubled
surface.The lake at this point was deep, and though there was a rush of
the M’Diarmods towards it, yet in their confusion they were but awkward
aids, and the fluttering ensign that marked the fatal spot had sunk
before they reached it.The strength of Connor, disabled as he was by
his broken limb, and trammelled by her from whom even the final struggle
could not dissever him, had failed; and with her he loved locked in his
last embrace, they were after a time recovered from the water, and laid
side by side upon the bank, in all their touching, though, alas, lifeless
beauty!Remorse reached the rugged hearts even of those who had so
ruthlessly dealt by them; and as they looked on their goodly forms, thus
cold and senseless by a common fate, the rudest felt that it would be
an impious and unpardonable deed to do violence to their memory, by the
separation of that union which death itself had sanctified.Thus were
they laid in one grave; and, strange as it may appear, their fathers,
crushed and subdued, exhausted even of resentment by the overwhelming
stroke--for nothing can quell the stubborn spirit like the extremity of
sorrow--crossed their arms in amity over their remains, and grief wrought
the reconciliation which even centuries of time, that great pacificator,
had failed to do.The westering sun now warning me that the day was on the wane, I gave but
another look to the time-worn tombstone, another sigh to the early doom
of those whom it enclosed, and then, with a feeling of regret, again left
the little island to its still, unshared, and pensive loneliness.ANCIENT IRISH LITERATURE--No.The composition which we have selected as our fourth specimen of the
ancient literature of Ireland, is a poem, more remarkable, perhaps,
for its antiquity and historical interest, than for its poetic merits,
though we do not think it altogether deficient in those.It is ascribed,
apparently with truth, to the celebrated poet Mac Liag, the secretary of
the renowned monarch Brian Boru, who, as our readers are aware, fell at
the battle of Clontarf in 1014; and the subject of it is a lamentation
for the fallen condition of Kincora, the palace of that monarch,
consequent on his death.The decease of Mac Liag, whose proper name was Muircheartach, is thus
recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters, at the year 1015:--

“Mac Liag, i. e. Muirkeartach, son of Conkeartach, at this time laureate
of Ireland, died.”

A great number of his productions are still in existence; but none of
them have obtained a popularity so widely extended as the poem before us.Of the palace of Kincora, which was situated on the banks of the Shannon,
near Killaloe, there are at present no vestiges.LAMENTATION OF MAC LIAG FOR KINCORA.A Chinn-copath carthi Brian?And where is the beauty that once was thine?Oh, where are the princes and nobles that sate
    At the feast in thy halls, and drank the red wine?Oh, where are the Dalcassians of the Golden Swords?[1]
    And where are the warriors that Brian led on?And where is Morogh, the descendant of kings--
    The defeater of a hundred--the daringly brave--
    Who set but slight store by jewels and rings--
    Who swam down the torrent and laughed at its wave?And where is Donogh, King Brian’s worthy son?And where is Conaing, the Beautiful Chief?they are gone--
    They have left me this night alone with my grief!And where are the chiefs with whom Brian went forth,
    The never-vanquished son of Evin the Brave,
    The great King of Onaght, renowned for his worth,
    And the hosts of Baskinn, from the western wave?Oh, where is Duvlann of the Swiftfooted Steeds?And where is Kian, who was son of Molloy?And where is King Lonergan, the fame of whose deeds
    In the red battle-field no time can destroy?And where is that youth of majestic height,
    The faith-keeping Prince of the Scots?--Even he,
    As wide as his fame was, as great as was his might,
    Was tributary, oh, Kincora, to me!They are gone, those heroes of royal birth,
    Who plundered no churches, and broke no trust,
    ’Tis weary for me to be living on the earth
    When they, oh, Kincora, lie low in the dust!Oh, never again will Princes appear,
    To rival the Dalcassians of the Cleaving Swords!I can never dream of meeting afar or anear,
    In the east or the west, such heroes and lords!Oh, dear are the images my memory calls up
    Of Brian Boru!--how he never would miss
    To give me at the banquet the first bright cup!why did he heap on me honour like this?I am Mac Liag, and my home is on the Lake:
    Thither often, to that palace whose beauty is fled,
    Came Brian to ask me, and I went for his sake.that I should live, and Brian be dead![1] _Coolg n-or_, of the swords _of gold_, i. e. of the _gold-hilted_
swords.“Biography of a mouse!” cries the reader; “well, what shall we have
next?--what can the writer mean by offering such nonsense for our
perusal?” There is no creature, reader, however insignificant and
unimportant in the great scale of creation it may appear to us,
short-sighted mortals that we are, which is forgotten in the care of
our own common Creator; not a sparrow falls to the ground unknown and
unpermitted by Him; and whether or not you may derive interest from the
biography even of a mouse, you will be able to form a better judgment,
after, than before, having read my paper.The mouse belongs to the class _Mammalia_, or the animals which rear
their young by suckling them; to the order _Rodentia_, or animals whose
teeth are adapted for _gnawing_; to the genus _Mus_, or Rat kind, and the
family of _Mus musculus_, or domestic mouse.The mouse is a singularly
beautiful little animal, as no one who examines it attentively, and
without prejudice, can fail to discover.Its little body is plump and
sleek; its neck short; its head tapering and graceful; and its eyes
large, prominent, and sparkling.Its manners are lively and interesting,
its agility surprising, and its habits extremely cleanly.There are
several varieties of this little creature, amongst which the best known
is the common brown mouse of our granaries and store-rooms; the Albino,
or white mouse, with red eyes; and the black and white mouse, which is
more rare and very delicate.I mention these as _varieties_, for I think
we may safely regard them as such, from the fact of their propagating
unchanged, preserving their difference of hue to the fiftieth generation,
and never accidentally occurring amongst the offspring of differently
 parents.It is of the white mouse that I am now about to treat, and it is an
account of a tame individual of that extremely pretty variety that is
designed to form the subject of my present paper.When I was a boy of about sixteen, I got possession of a white mouse; the
little creature was very wild and unsocial at first, but by dint of care
and discipline I succeeded in rendering it familiar.The principal agent
I employed towards effecting its domestication was a singular one, and
which, though I can assure the reader its effects are speedy and certain,
still remains to me inexplicable: this was, ducking in cold water; and by
resorting to this simple expedient, I have since succeeded in rendering
even the rat as tame and as playful as a kitten.It is out of my power to
explain the manner in which _ducking_ operates on the animal subjected to
it, but I wish that some physiologist more experienced than I am would
give his attention to the subject, and favour the public with the result
of his reflections.At the time that I obtained possession of this mouse, I was residing at
Olney, in Buckinghamshire, a village which I presume my readers will
recollect as connected with the names of Newton and Cowper; but shortly
after having succeeded in rendering it pretty tame, circumstances
required my removal to Gloucester, whither I carried my little favourite
with me.During the journey I kept the mouse confined in a small wire
cage; but while resting at the inn where I passed the night, I adopted
the precaution of enveloping the cage in a handkerchief, lest by some
untoward circumstance its active little inmate might make its escape.Having thus, as I thought, made all safe, I retired to rest.The moment
I awoke in the morning, I sprang from my bed, and went to examine the
cage, when, to my infinite consternation, I found it empty!I searched
the bed, the room, raised the carpet, examined every nook and corner, but
all to no purpose.I dressed myself as hastily as I could, and summoning
one of the waiters, an intelligent, good-natured man, I informed
him of my loss, and got him to search every room in the house.His
investigations, however, proved equally unavailing, and I gave my poor
little pet completely up, inwardly hoping, despite of its ingratitude
in leaving me, that it might meet with some agreeable mate amongst its
brown congeners, and might lead a long and happy life, unchequered by
the terrors of the prowling cat, and unendangered by the more insidious
artifices of the fatal trap.With these reflections I was just getting
into the coach which was to convey me upon my road, when a waiter came
running to the door, out of breath, exclaiming, “Mr R., Mr R., I declare
your little mouse is in the kitchen.” Begging the coachman to wait an
instant, I followed the man to the kitchen, and there, on the hob,
seated contentedly in a pudding dish, and devouring its contents with
considerable _gout_, was my truant protegé.Once more secured within
its cage, and the latter carefully enveloped in a sheet of strong brown
paper, upon my knee, I reached Gloucester.I was here soon subjected to a similar alarm, for one morning the cage
was again empty, and my efforts to discover the retreat of the wanderer
unavailing as before.This time I had lost him for a week, when one
night, in getting into bed, I heard a scrambling in the curtains, and on
relighting my candle found the noise to have been occasioned by my mouse,
who seemed equally pleased with myself at our reunion.After having thus
lost and found my little friend a number of times, I gave up the idea
of confining him; and, accordingly, leaving the door of his cage open,
I placed it in a corner of my bedroom, and allowed him to go in and out
as he pleased.Of this permission he gladly availed himself, but would
regularly return to me at intervals of a week or a fortnight, and at such
periods of return he was usually much thinner than ordinary; and it was
pretty clear that during his visits to his brown acquaintances he fared
by no means so well as he did at home.Sometimes, when he happened to return, as he often did, in the
night-time, on which occasions his general custom was to come into bed to
me, I used, in order to induce him to remain with me until morning, to
immerse him in a basin of water, and then let him lie in my bosom, the
warmth of which, after his cold bath, commonly ensured his stay.Frequently, while absent on one of his excursions, I would hear an
unusual noise in the wainscot, as I lay in bed, of dozens of mice
running backwards and forwards in all directions, and squeaking in much
apparent glee.For some time I was puzzled to know whether this unusual
disturbance was the result of merriment or quarrelling, and I often
trembled for the safety of my pet, alone and unaided, among so many
strangers.But a very interesting circumstance occurred one morning,
which perfectly reassured me.It was a bright summer morning, about four
o’clock, and I was lying awake, reflecting as to the propriety of turning
on my pillow to take another sleep, or at once rising, and going forth to
enjoy the beauties of awakening nature.While thus meditating, I heard a
slight scratching in the wainscot, and looking towards the spot whence
the noise proceeded, perceived the head of a mouse peering from a hole.It was instantly withdrawn, but a second was thrust forth.This latter I
at once recognised as my own white friend, but so begrimed by soot and
dirt that it required an experienced eye to distinguish him from his
darker-coated entertainers.He emerged from the hole, and running over
to his cage, entered it, and remained for a couple of seconds within
it; he then returned to the wainscot, and, re-entering the hole, some
scrambling and squeaking took place.A second time he came forth, and on
this occasion was followed closely, to my no small astonishment, by a
brown mouse, who followed him, with much apparent timidity and caution,
to his box, and entered it along with him.More astonished at this
singular proceeding than I can well express, I lay fixed in mute and
breathless attention, to see what would follow next.In about a minute
the two mice came forth from the cage, each bearing in its mouth a large
piece of bread, which they dragged towards the hole they had previously
left.On arriving at it, they entered, but speedily re-appeared, having
deposited their burden; and repairing once more to the cage, again loaded
themselves with provision, and conveyed it away.This second time they
remained within the hole for a much longer period than the first time;
and when they again made their appearance, they were attended by three
other mice, who, following their leaders to the cage, loaded themselves
with bread as did they, and carried away their burdens to the hole.After
this I saw them no more that morning, and on rising I discovered that
they had carried away every particle of food that the cage contained.Nor
was this an isolated instance of their white guest leading them forth to
where he knew they should find provender.Day after day, whatever bread
or grain I left in the cage was regularly removed, and the duration of my
pet’s absence was proportionately long.Wishing to learn whether hunger
was the actual cause of his return, I no longer left food in his box; and
in about a week afterwards, on awaking one morning, I found him sleeping
upon the pillow, close to my face, having partly wormed his way under my
cheek.There was a cat in the house, an excellent mouser, and I dreaded lest she
should one day meet with and destroy my poor mouse, and I accordingly
used all my exertions with those in whose power it was, to obtain her
dismissal.She was, however, regarded by those persons as infinitely
better entitled to protection and patronage than a mouse, so I was
compelled to put up with her presence.People are fond of imputing to
cats a supernatural degree of sagacity: they will sometimes go so far
as to pronounce them to be genuine _witches_; and really I am scarcely
surprised at it, nor perhaps will the reader be, when I tell him the
following anecdote.I was one day entering my apartment, when I was filled with horror at
perceiving my mouse picking up some crumbs upon the carpet, beneath
the table, and the terrible cat seated upon a chair watching him with
what appeared to me to be an expression of sensual anticipation and
concentrated desire.Before I had time to interfere, Puss sprang from
her chair, and bounded towards the mouse, who, however, far from being
terrified at the approach of his natural enemy, scarcely so much as
favoured her with a single look.Puss raised her paw and dealt him a
gentle tap, when, judge of my astonishment if you can, the little mouse,
far from running away, or betraying any marks of fear, raised himself
on his legs, cocked his tail, and with a shrill and angry squeak, with
which any that have kept tame mice are well acquainted, sprang at and
positively _bit_ the paw which had struck him.I could
not jump forward to the rescue.I was, as it were, petrified where I
stood.But, stranger than all, the cat, instead of appearing irritated,
or seeming to design mischief, merely stretched out her nose and smelt
at her diminutive assailant, and then resuming her place upon the chair,
purred herself to sleep.I need not say that I immediately secured the
mouse within his cage.Whether the cat on this occasion knew the little
animal to be a pet, and as such feared to meddle with it, or whether its
boldness had disarmed her, I cannot pretend to explain: I merely state
the fact; and I think the reader will allow that it is sufficiently
extraordinary.In order to guard against such a dangerous encounter for the future,
I got a more secure cage made, of which the bars were so close as to
preclude the possibility of egress; and singularly enough, many a morning
was I amused by beholding brown mice coming from their holes in the
wainscot, and approaching the cage in which their friend was kept, as if
in order to condole with him on the subject of his unwonted captivity.Secure, however, as I conceived this new cage to be, my industrious pet
contrived to make his escape from it, and in doing so met his death.In
my room was a large bureau, with deep, old-fashioned, capacious drawers.Being obliged to go from home for a day, I put the cage containing my
little friend into one of these drawers, lest any one should attempt to
meddle with it during my absence.On returning, I opened the drawer,
and just as I did so, heard a faint squeak, and at the same instant my
poor little pet fell from the back of the drawer--lifeless.I took up
his body, and, placing it in my bosom, did my best to restore it to
animation.His little body had been crushed
in the crevice at the back part of the drawer, through which he had been
endeavouring to escape, and he was really and irrecoverably gone.*       *       *       *       *

NOTE ON THE FEEDING, &C., OF WHITE MICE.--Such of my juvenile readers
as may be disposed to make a pet of one of these interesting little
animals, would do well to observe the following rules:--Clean the cage
out daily, and keep it dry; do not keep it in too cold a place; in
winter it should be kept in a room in which there is a fire.Feed the
mice on bread steeped in milk, having first squeezed the milk out, as
too moist food is bad for them.Never give them cheese, as it is apt to
produce fatal disorders, though the more hardy brown mice eat it with
impunity.If you want to give them a treat, give them grains of wheat
or barley, or if these are not to be procured, oats or rice.A little
tin box of water should be constantly left in their cage, but securely
fixed, so that they cannot overturn it.Let the wires be not too slight,
or too long, otherwise the little animals will easily squeeze themselves
between them, and let them be of iron, never of copper, as the animals
are fond of nibbling at them, and the rust of the latter, or _verdigris_,
would quickly poison them.White mice are to be procured at most of the
bird-shops in Patrick’s Close, Dublin; of the wire-workers and bird-cage
makers in Edinburgh; and from all the animal fanciers in London,
whose residences are to be found chiefly on the New Road and about
Knightsbridge.Their prices vary from one shilling to two-and-sixpence
per pair, according to their age and beauty.H. D. R.




THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.Mary moved to the hallway.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in
their cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the
animal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there
till he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;
that is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,
and which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The
facility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the
branches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it
makes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,
it is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it
to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I'm sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile
tail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the
hay mow."But here is an
account of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black
hands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called
Hoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be
one of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to
death; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy
great quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by
the natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone
would compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us
that their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are
raised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in
which they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A
hand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum
in Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures
or hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other
substances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they
do not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general
cry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she
exclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a
difference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very
fond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount
them on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,
and if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most
beautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from
its extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at
liberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in
order to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a
wife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every
attention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much
cruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than
usual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,
after winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and
drew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave
her a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he
descended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great
indignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no
means always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one
more story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,
complied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this
chapter on Minnie's pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented
to his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress
used sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him
run up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,
ran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and
chattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,
'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally
leaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled
himself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth
open, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former
experience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at
cleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the
handle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he
relinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and
boots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering
all the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole
and all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &
Martin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was
a nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found
Sprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and
arranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he
heard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as
though nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was
given him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his
finger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the
other, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed
himself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped
out and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

many virtues honored!The history of this single family is the history of
the human race!"Passing, in the course of so many generations, through the veins of the
poor and the rich, of the sovereign and the bandit, of the wise man and
the fool, of the coward and the brave, of the saint and the atheist, the
blood of my sister has transmitted itself to this hour."What scions of this family are now remaining?"Two orphans, the daughters of proscribed parents--a dethroned prince--a
poor missionary priest--a man of the middle class--a young girl of a
great name and large fortune--a mechanic."Together, they comprise in themselves the virtues, the courage, the
degradation, the splendor, the miseries of our species!"Siberia--India--America--France--behold the divers places where fate has
thrown them!"My instinct teaches me when one of them is in peril.Then, from the
North to the South, from the East to the West, I go to seek them.Yesterday amid the polar frosts--to-day in the temperate zone--to-morrow
beneath the fires of the tropics--but often, alas!at the moment when my
presence might save them, the invisible hand impels me, the whirlwind
carries me away, and the voice speaks in my ear: 'GO ON!"Oh, that I might only finish my task!--'GO ON!'--A single hour--only a
single hour of repose!--'GO ON!'--Alas!I leave those I love on the brink
of the abyss!--'GO ON!If it is great, my crime was greater still!An
artisan, devoted to privations and misery, my misfortunes had made me
cruel."Oh, cursed, cursed be the day, when, as I bent over my work, sullen with
hate and despair, because, in spite of my incessant labor, I and mine
wanted for everything, the Saviour passed before my door."Reviled, insulted, covered with blows, hardly able to sustain the weight
of his heavy cross, He asked me to let Him rest a moment on my stone
bench.The sweat poured from His forehead, His feet were bleeding, He was
well-nigh sinking with fatigue, and He said to me, in a mild, heart
piercing voice: 'I suffer!''And I too suffer,' I replied, as with harsh
anger I pushed Him from the place; 'I suffer, and no one comes to help
me!I find no pity, and will give none.Then, with a deep
sigh of pain, He answered, and spake this sentence: 'Verily, thou shalt
go on till the day of thy redemption, for so wills the Father which art
in heaven!'Too late I opened these eyes to the light,
too late I learned repentance and charity, too late I understood those
divine words of Him I had outraged, words which should be the law of the
whole human race."In vain through successive ages, gathering strength and eloquence from
those celestial words, have I labored to earn my pardon, by filling with
commiseration and love hearts that were overflowing with envy and
bitterness, by inspiring many a soul with a sacred horror of oppression
and injustice.For me the day of mercy has not yet dawned!"And even as the first man, by his fall, devoted his posterity to
misfortune, it would seem as if I, the workman, had consigned the whole
race of artisans to endless sorrows, and as if they were expiating my
crime: for they alone, during these eighteen centuries, have not yet been
delivered."For eighteen centuries, the powerful and the happy of this world have
said to the toiling people what I said to the imploring and suffering
Saviour: 'Go on!And the people, sinking with fatigue, bearing
their heavy cross, have answered in the bitterness of their grief: 'Oh,
for pity's sake!a few moments of repose; we are worn out with toil.'--'And if we perish in our pain, what will become of our little
children and our aged mothers?'And, for eighteen
centuries, they and I have continued to struggle forward and to suffer,
and no charitable voice has yet pronounced the word 'Enough!'It is immense, it is two-fold.I suffer in
the name of humanity, when I see these wretched multitudes consigned
without respite to profitless and oppressive toil.I suffer in the name
of my family, when, poor and wandering, I am unable to bring aid to the
descendants of my dear sister.But, when the sorrow is above my strength,
when I foresee some danger from which I cannot preserve my own, then my
thoughts, travelling over the world, go in search of that woman like me
accursed, that daughter of a queen, who, like me, the son of a laborer,
wanders, and will wander on, till the day of her redemption.[3]

"Once in a century, as two planets draw nigh to each other in their
revolutions, I am permitted to meet this woman during the dread week of
the Passion.And after this interview, filled with terrible remembrances
and boundless griefs, wandering stars of eternity, we pursue our infinite
course."And this woman, the only one upon earth who, like me, sees the end of
every century, and exclaims: 'What another?'this woman responds to my
thought, from the furthest extremity of the world.She, who alone shares
my terrible destiny, has chosen to share also the only interest that has
consoled me for so many ages.Those descendants of my dear sister, she
too loves, she too protects them.For them she journeys likewise from
East to West and from North to South.the invisible hand impels her, the whirlwind carries her away,
and the voice speaks in her ear: 'Go on!'--'Oh that I might finish my
sentence!'repeats she also,--'Go on!'--'A single hour--only a single hour
of repose!'--'I leave those I love on the brink of the
abyss.'Go on!--'"

Whilst this man thus went over the hill absorbed in his thoughts, the
light evening breeze increased almost to a gale, a vivid flash streamed
across the sky, and long, deep whistlings announced the coming of a
tempest.On a sudden this doomed man, who could no longer weep or smile, started
with a shudder.No physical pain could reach him, and yet he pressed his
hand hastily to his heart, as though he had experienced a cruel pang.This hour, many of those whom I love--the
descendants of my dear sister--suffer, and are in great peril.Some in
the centre of India--some in America--some here in Germany.The struggle
recommences, the detestable passions are again awake.Oh, thou that
hearest me--thou, like myself wandering and accursed--Herodias!May my invocation reach thee, in those American
solitudes where thou now lingerest--and may we arrive in time!"The man made a
movement; precipitately, to retrace his steps--but an invisible force
prevented him, and carried him forward in the opposite direction.At this moment, the storm burst forth in its murky majesty.One of those
whirlwinds, which tear up trees by the roots and shake the foundations of
the rocks, rushed over the hill rapid and loud as thunder.In the midst of the roaring of the hurricane, by the glare of the fiery
flashes, the man with the black mark on his brow was seen descending the
hill, stalking with huge strides among the rocks, and between trees bent
beneath the efforts of the storm.The tread of this man was no longer slow, firm, and steady--but painfully
irregular, like that of one impelled by an irresistible power, or carried
along by the whirl of a frightful wind.In vain he extended his
supplicating hands to heaven.Soon he disappeared in the shades of night,
and amid the roar of the tempest.[2] It is known that, according to the legend, the Wandering Jew was a
shoemaker at Jerusalem.The Saviour, carrying his cross, passed before
the house of the artisan, and asked him to be allowed to rest an instant
on the stone bench at his door.said the Jew harshly,
pushing him away."Thou shalt go on till the end of time," answered the
Saviour, in a stern though sorrowful tone.For further details, see the
eloquent and learned notice by Charles Magnin, appended to the
magnificent poem "Ahasuerus," by Ed.[3] According to a legend very little known, for we are indebted to the
kindness of M. Maury, the learned sub-librarian of the Institute,
Herodias was condemned to wander till the day of judgement, for having
asked for the death of John the Baptist--E. S.




CHAPTER XVII

THE AJOUPA.While Rodin despatched his cosmopolite correspondence, from his retreat
in the Rue du Milieu des Ursins, in Paris--while the daughters of General
Simon, after quitting as fugitives the White Falcon, were detained
prisoners at Leipsic along with Dagobert--other scenes, deeply
interesting to these different personages, were passing, almost as it
were at the same moment, at the other extremity of the world, in the
furthermost parts of Asia--that is to say, in the island of Java, not far
from the city of Batavia, the residence of M. Joshua Van Dael, one of the
correspondents of Rodin.magnificent and fatal country, where the most admirable flowers
conceal hideous reptiles, where the brightest fruits contain subtle
poisons, where grow splendid trees, whose very shadow is death--where the
gigantic vampire bat sucks the blood of its victims whilst it prolongs
their sleep, by surrounding them with a fresh and balmy air, no fan
moving so rapidly as the great perfumed wings of this monster!The month of October, 1831, draws near its close.It is noon--an hour
well nigh mortal to him who encounters the fiery heat of the sun, which
spreads a sheet of dazzling light over the deep blue enamel of the sky.An ajoupa, or hut, made of cane mats, suspended from long bamboos, which
are driven far into the ground, rises in the midst of the bluish shadows
cast by a tuft of trees, whose glittering verdure resembles green
porcelain.These quaintly formed trees, rounded into arches, pointing
like spires, overspreading like parasols, are so thick in foliage, so
entangled one with the other, that their dome is impenetrable to the
rain.The soil, ever marshy, notwithstanding the insupportable heat, disappears
beneath an inextricable mass of creepers, ferns, and tufted reeds, of a
freshness and vigor of vegetation almost incredible, reaching nearly to
the top of the ajoupa, which lies hid like a nest among the grass.Nothing can be more suffocating than the atmosphere, heavily laden with
moist exhalations like the steam of hot water, and impregnated with the
strongest and sharpest scents; for the cinnamon-tree, ginger-plant,
stephanotis and Cape jasmine, mixed with these trees and creepers, spread
around in puffs their penetrating odors.A roof, formed of large Indian
fig-leaves, covers the cabin; at one end is a square opening, which
serves for a window, shut in with a fine lattice-work of vegetable
fibres, so as to prevent the reptiles and venomous insects from creeping
into the ajoupa.The huge trunk of a dead tree, still standing, but much
bent, and with its summit reaching to the roof of the ajoupa, rises from
the midst of the brushwood.From every crevice in its black, rugged,
mossy bark, springs a strange, almost fantastic flower; the wing of a
butterfly is not of a finer tissue, of a more brilliant purple, of a more
glossy black: those unknown birds we see in our dreams, have no more
grotesque forms than these specimens of the orchis--winged flowers, that
seem always ready to fly from their frail and leafless stalks.The long,
flexible stems of the cactus, which might be taken for reptiles, encircle
also this trunk, and clothe it with their bunches of silvery white,
shaded inside with bright orange.These flowers emit a strong scent of
vanilla.A serpent, of a brick-red, about the thickness of a large quill, and five
or six inches long, half protrudes its flat head from one of those
enormous, perfumed calyces, in which it lies closely curled up.Within the ajoupa, a young man is extended on a mat in a profound sleep.His complexion of a clear golden yellow, gives him the appearance of a
statue of pale bronze, on which a ray of sun is playing.His attitude is
simple and graceful; his right arm sustains his head, a little raised and
turned on one side; his ample robe of white muslin, with hanging sleeves,
leaves uncovered his chest and arms worthy of the Antoinous.Marble is
not more firm, more polished than his skin, the golden hue of which
contracts strongly with the whiteness of his garments.Upon his broad
manly chest a deep scar is visible--the mark of the musket-ball he
received in defending the life of General Simon, the father of Rose and
Blanche.Suspended from his neck, he wears a medal similar to that in the
possession of the two sisters.His features are at once very noble and very beautiful.His hair of a
blue black, parted upon his forehead, falls waving, but not curled over
his shoulders; whilst his eyebrows, boldly and yet delicately defined,
are of as deep a jet as the long eyelashes, that cast their shadow upon
his beardless cheek.His bright, red lips are slightly apart, and he
breathes uneasily; his sleep is heavy and troubled, for the heat becomes
every moment more and more suffocating.Yet
now the tall ferns, which cover the soil, begin to move almost
imperceptibly, as though their stems were shaken by the slow progress of
some crawling body.From time to time, this trifling oscillation suddenly
ceases, and all is again motionless.But, after several of these
alternations of rustling and deep silence, a human head appears in the
midst of the jungle, a little distance from the trunk of the dead tree.The man to whom it belonged was possessed of a grim countenance, with a
complexion the color of greenish bronze, long black hair bound about his
temples, eyes brilliant with savage fire, and an expression remarkable
for its intelligence and ferocity.Holding his breath, he remained quite
still for a moment; then, advancing upon his hands and knees, pushing
aside the leaves so gently, that not the slightest noise could be heard,
he arrived cautiously and slowly at the trunk of the dead tree, the
summit of which nearly touched the roof of the ajoupa.This man, of Malay origin, belonging to the sect of the Lughardars
(Stranglers), after having again listened, rose almost entirely from
amongst the brushwood.With the exception of white cotton drawers,
fastened around his middle by a parti- sash, he was completely
naked.His bronze, supple, and nervous limbs were overlaid with a thick
coat of oil.Stretching himself along the huge trunk on the side furthest
from the cabin, and thus sheltered by the whole breadth of the tree with
its surrounding creepers, he began to climb silently, with as much
patience as caution.In the undulations of his form, in the flexibility
of his movements, in the restrained vigor, which fully put forth would
have been alarming, there was some resemblance to the stealthy and
treacherous advance of the tiger upon its prey.Having reached, completely unperceived, the inclined portion of the tree,
which almost touched the roof of the cabin, he was only separated from
the window by a distance of about a foot.Cautiously advancing his head,
he looked down into the interior, to see how he might best find an
entrance.At sight of Djalma in his deep sleep, the Thug's bright eyes glittered
with increased brilliancy; a nervous contraction, or rather a mute,
ferocious laugh, curling the corners of his mouth, drew them up towards
the cheekbones, and exposed rows of teeth, filed sharp like the points of
a saw, and dyed of a shining black.Djalma was lying in such a manner and so near the door of the ajoupa,
which opened inwards, that, were it moved in the least, he must be
instantly awakened.The Strangler, with his body still sheltered by the
tree, wishing to examine more attentively the interior of the cabin,
leaned very forward, and in order to maintain his balance, lightly rested
his hand on the ledge of the opening that served for a window.This
movement shook the large cactus-flowers, within which the little serpent
lay curled, and, darting forth it twisted itself rapidly round the wrist
of the Strangler.Whether from pain or surprise, the man uttered a low
cry; and as he drew back swiftly, still holding by the trunk of the tree,
he perceived that Djalma had moved.The young Indian, though retaining his supine posture, had half opened
his eyes, and turned his head towards the window, whilst his breast
heaved with a deep-drawn sigh, for, beneath that thick dome of moist
verdure, the concentrated heat was intolerable.Hardly had he moved, when, from behind the tree, was heard the shrill,
brief, sonorous note, which the bird of paradise titters when it takes
its flight--a cry which resembles that of the pheasant.This note was
soon repeated, but more faintly, as though the brilliant bird were
already at a distance.Djalma, thinking he had discovered the cause of
the noise which had aroused him for an instant, stretched out the arm
upon which his head had rested, and went to sleep again, with scarcely
any change of position.For some minutes, the most profound silence once more reigned in this
solitude, and everything remained motionless.The Strangler, by his skillful imitation of the bird, had repaired the
imprudence of that exclamation of surprise and pain, which the reptile
bite had forced from him.When he thought all was safe, he again advanced
his head, and saw the young Indian once more plunged in sleep.Then he
descended the tree with the same precautions, though his left hand was
somewhat swollen from the sting of the serpent, and disappeared in the
jungle.At that instant a song of monotonous and melancholy cadence was heard in
the distance.The Strangler raised himself, and listened attentively, and
his face took an expression of surprise and deadly anger.The song came
nearer and nearer to the cabin, and, in a few seconds, an Indian, passing
through an open space in the jungle, approached the spot where the Thug
lay concealed.The latter unwound from his waist a long thin cord, to one of the ends of
which was attached a leaden ball, of the form and size of an egg; having
fastened the other end of this cord to his right wrist, the Strangler
again listened, and then disappeared, crawling through the tall grass in
the direction of the Indian, who still advanced slowly, without
interrupting his soft and plaintive song.He was a young fellow scarcely twenty, with a bronzed complexion, the
slave of Djalma, his vest of blue cotton was confined at the waist by a
parti- sash; he wore a red turban, and silver rings in his ears
and about his wrists.He was bringing a message to his master, who,
during the great heat of the day was reposing in the ajoupa, which stood
at some distance from the house he inhabited.Arriving at a place where two paths separated, the slave, without
hesitation took that which led to the cabin, from which he was now scarce
forty paces distant.One of those enormous Java butterflies, whose wings extend six or eight
inches in length, and offer to the eye two streaks of gold on a ground of
ultramarine, fluttering from leaf to leaf, alighted on a bush of Cape
jasmine, within the reach of the young Indian.The slave stopped in his
song, stood still, advanced first a foot, then a hand, and seized the
butterfly.Suddenly he sees a dark figure rise before him; he hears a whizzing noise
like that of a sling; he feels a cord, thrown with as much rapidity as
force, encircle his neck with a triple band; and, almost in the same
instant, the leaden ball strikes violently against the back of his head.This attack was so abrupt and unforseen, that Djalma's servant could not
even utter a single cry, a single groan.He tottered--the Strangler gave
a vigorous pull at the cord--the bronzed countenance of the slave became
purple, and he fell upon his knees, convulsively moving his arms.Then
the Strangler threw him quite down, and pulled the cord so violently,
that the blood spurted from the skin.The victim struggled for a
moment--and all was over.During his short but intense agony, the murderer, kneeling before his
victim, and watching with ardent eye his least convulsions, seemed
plunged into an ecstasy of ferocious joy.His nostrils dilated, the veins
of his neck and temples were swollen, and the same savage laugh, which
had curled his lips at the aspect of the sleeping Djalma, again displayed
his pointed black teeth, which a nervous trembling of the jaws made to
chatter.But soon he crossed his arms upon his heaving breast, bowed his
forehead, and murmured some mysterious words, which sounded like an
invocation or a prayer.Immediately after, he returned to the
contemplation of the dead body.The hyena and the tiger-cat, who, before
devouring, crouch beside the prey that they have surprised or hunted
down, have not a wilder or more sanguinary look than this man.But, remembering that his task was not yet accomplished tearing himself
unwillingly from the hideous spectacle, he unbound the cord from the neck
of his victim, fastened it round his own body, dragged the corpse out of
the path, and, without attempting to rob it of its silver rings,
concealed it in a thick part of the jungle.Then the Strangler again began to creep on his knees and belly, till he
arrived at the cabin of Djalma--that cabin constructed of mats suspended
from bamboos.After listening attentively, he drew from his girdle a
knife, the sharp-pointed blade of which was wrapped in a fig-leaf, and
made in the matting an incision of three feet in length.This was done
with such quickness, and with so fine a blade, that the light touch of
the diamond cutting glass would have made more noise.Seeing, by means of
this opening, which was to serve him for a passage, that Djalma was still
fast asleep, the Thug, with incredible temerity, glided into the cabin.THE TATTOOING

The heavens, which had been till now of transparent blue, became
gradually of a greenish tint, and the sun was veiled in red, lurid vapor.This strange light gave to every object a weird appearance, of which one
might form an idea, by looking at a landscape through a piece of copper
 glass.In those climates, this phenomenon, when united with an
increase of burning heat, always announces the approach of a storm.From time to time there was a passing odor of sulphur; then the leaves,
slightly shaken by electric currents, would tremble upon their stalks;
till again all would return to the former motionless silence.The weight
of the burning atmosphere, saturated with sharp perfumes, became almost
intolerable.Large drops of sweat stood in pearls on the forehead of
Djalma, still plunged in enervating sleep--for it no longer resembled
rest, but a painful stupor.The Strangler glided like a reptile along the sides of the ajoupa, and,
crawling on his belly, arrived at the sleeping-mat of Djalma, beside
which he squatted himself, so as to occupy as little space as possible.Then began a fearful scene, by reason of the mystery and silence which
surrounded it.Djalma's life was at the mercy of the Strangler.The latter, resting upon
his hands and knees, with his neck stretched forward, his eye fixed and
dilated, continued motionless as a wild beast about to spring.Only a
slight nervous trembling of the jaws agitated that mask of bronze.But soon his hideous features revealed a violent struggle that was
passing within him--a struggle between the thirst, the craving for the
enjoyment of murder, which the recent assassination of the slave had made
still more active, and the orders he had received not to attempt the life
of Djalma, though the design, which brought him to the ajoupa, might
perhaps be as fatal to the young Indian as death itself.Twice did the
Strangler, with look of flame, resting only on his left hand, seize with
his right the rope's end; and twice his hand fell--the instinct of murder
yielding to a powerful will, of which the Malay acknowledged the
irresistible empire.In him, the homicidal craving must have amounted to madness, for, in
these hesitations, he lost much precious time: at any moment, Djalma,
whose vigor, skill, and courage were known and feared, might awake from
his sleep, and, though unarmed, he would prove a terrible adversary.At
length the Thug made up his mind; with a suppressed sigh of regret, he
set about accomplishing his task.This task would have appeared impossible to any one else.Djalma, with his face turned towards the left, leaned his head upon his
curved arm.It was first necessary, without waking him, to oblige him to
turn his face towards the right (that is, towards the door), so that, in
case of his being half-roused, his first glance might not fall upon the
Strangler.The latter, to accomplish his projects, would have to remain
many minutes in the cabin.The heavens became darker; the heat arrived at its last degree of
intensity; everything combined to increase the torpor of the sleeper, and
so favor the Strangler's designs.Kneeling down close to Djalma, he
began, with the tips of his supple, well-oiled fingers, to stroke the
brow, temples, and eyelids of the young Indian, but with such extreme
lightness, that the contact of the two skins was hardly sensible.When
this kind of magnetic incantation had lasted for some seconds, the sweat,
which bathed the forehead of Djalma, became more abundant: he heaved a
smothered sigh, and the muscles of his face gave several twitches, for
the strokings, although too light to rouse him, yet caused in him a
feeling of indefinable uneasiness.Watching him with his restless and burning eye, the Strangler continued
his maneuvers with so much patience, that Djalma, still sleeping, but no
longer able to bear this vague, annoying sensation, raised his right hand
mechanically to his face, as if he would have brushed away an importunate
insect.But he had not strength to do it; almost immediately after, his
hand, inert and heavy, fell back upon his chest.The Strangler saw, by
this symptom, that he was attaining his object, and continued to stroke,
with the same address, the eyelids, brow, and temples.Whereupon Djalma, more and more oppressed by heavy sleep, and having
neither strength nor will to raise his hand to his face, mechanically
turned round his head, which fell languidly upon his right shoulder,
seeking by this change of attitude, to escape from the disagreeable
sensation which pursued him.The first point gained, the Strangler could
act more freely.To render as profound as possible the sleep he had half interrupted, he
now strove to imitate the vampire, and, feigning the action of a fan, he
rapidly moved his extended hands about the burning face of the young
Indian.Alive to a feeling of such sudden and delicious coolness, in the
height of suffocating heat, the countenance of Djalma brightened, his
bosom heaved, his half-opened lips drank in the grateful air, and he fell
into a sleep only the more invincible, because it had been at first
disturbed, and was now yielded to under the influence of a pleasing
sensation.A sudden flash of lightning illumined the shady dome that sheltered the
ajoupa: fearing that the first clap of thunder might rouse the young
Indian, the Strangler hastened to complete his Task.Djalma lay on his
back, with his head resting on his right shoulder, and his left arm
extended; the Thug, crouching at his left side, ceased by degrees the
process of fanning; then, with incredible dexterity, he succeeded in
rolling up, above the elbow, the long wide sleeve of white muslin that
covered the left arm of the sleeper.He next drew from the pocket of his drawers a copper box, from which he
took a very fine, sharp-pointed needle, and a piece of a black-looking
root.He pricked this root several times with the needle, and on each
occasion there issued from it a white, glutinous liquid.When the Strangler thought the needle sufficiently impregnated with this
juice, he bent down, and began to blow gently over the inner surface of
Djalma's arm, so as to cause a fresh sensation of coolness; then, with
the point of his needle, he traced almost imperceptibly on the skin of
the sleeping youth some mysterious and symbolical signs.All this was
performed so cleverly and the point of the needle was so fine and keen,
that Djalma did not feel the action of the acid upon the skin.The signs, which the Strangler had traced, soon appeared on the surface,
at first in characters of a pale rose-color, as fine as a hair; but such
was the slowly corrosive power of the juice, that, as it worked and
spread beneath the skin, they would become in a few hours of a violet
red, and as apparent as they were now almost invisible.The Strangler, having so perfectly succeeded in his project, threw a last
look of ferocious longing on the slumbering Indian, and creeping away
from the mat, regained the opening by which he had entered the cabin;
next, closely uniting the edges of the incision, so as to obviate all
suspicion, he disappeared just as the thunder began to rumble hoarsely in
the distance.[4]

[4] We read in the letters of the late Victor Jacquemont upon India, with
regard to the incredible dexterity of these men: "They crawl on the
ground, ditches, in the furrows of fields, imitate a hundred different
voices, and dissipate the effect of any accidental noise by raising the
yelp of the jackal or note of some bird--then are silent, and another
imitates the call of the same animal in the distance.They can molest a
sleeper by all sorts of noises and slight touches, and make his body and
limbs take any position which suits their purpose."Count Edward de
Warren, in his excellent work on English India, which we shall have again
occasion to quote, expresses himself in the same manner as to the
inconceivable address of the Indians: "They have the art," says he, "to
rob you, without interrupting your sleep, of the very sheet in which you
are enveloped.The
movements of the bheel are those of the serpent.If you sleep in your
tent, with a servant lying across each entrance, the bheel will come and
crouch on the outside, in some shady corner, where he can hear the
breathing of those within.As soon as the European sleeps, he feels sure
of success, for the Asiatic will not long resist the attraction of
repose.At the proper moment, he makes a vertical incision in the cloth
of the tent, on the spot where he happens to be, and just large enough to
admit him.He glides through like a phantom, without making the least
grain of sand creak beneath his tread.He is perfectly naked, and all his
body is rubbed over with oil; a two-edged knife is suspended from his
neck.He will squat down close to your couch, and, with incredible
coolness and dexterity, will gather up the sheet in very little folds, so
as to occupy the least surface possible; then, passing to the other side,
he will lightly tickle the sleeper, whom he seems to magnetize, till the
latter shrinks back involuntarily, and ends by turning round, and leaving
the sheet folded behind him.Should he awake, and strive to seize the
robber, he catches at a slippery form, which slides through his hands
like an eel; should he even succeed in seizing him, it would be
fatal--the dagger strikes him to the heart, he falls bathed in his blood,
and the assassin disappears."--E.S.




CHAPTER XIX

THE SMUGGLER

The tempest of the morning has long been over.The sun is verging towards
the horizon.Some hours have elapsed, since the Strangler introduced
himself into Djalma's cabin, and tattooed him with a mysterious sign
during his sleep.A horseman advances rapidly down a long avenue of spreading trees.Sheltered by the thick and verdant arch, a thousand birds salute the
splendid evening with songs and circlings; red and green parrots climb,
by help of their hooked beaks, to the top of pink-blossomed acacias;
large Morea birds of the finest and richest blue, whose throats and long
tails change in the light to a golden brown, are chasing the prince
oriels, clothed in their glossy feathers of black and orange; Kolo doves,
of a changeable violet hue, are gently cooing by the side of the birds of
paradise, in whose brilliant plumage are mingled the prismatic colors of
the emerald and ruby, the topaz and sapphire.This avenue, a little raised, commanded a view of a small pond, which
reflected at intervals the green shade of tamarind trees.In the calm,
limpid waters, many fish were visible, some with silver scales and purple
fins, others gleaming with azure and vermilion; so still were they that
they looked as if set in a mass of bluish crystal, and, as they dwelt
motionless near the surface of the pool, on which played a dazzling ray
of the sun, they revelled in the enjoyment of the light and heat.A
thousand insects--living gems, with wings of flame--glided, fluttered and
buzzed over the transparent wave, in which, at an extraordinary depth,
were mirrored the variegated tints of the aquatic plants on the bank.It is impossible to give an adequate idea of the exuberant nature of this
scene, luxuriant in the sunlight, colors, and perfumes, which served, so
to speak, as a frame to the young and brilliant rider, who was advancing
along the avenue.He had not yet perceived the indelible
marks, which the Strangler had traced upon his left arm.His Japanese mare, of slender make, full of fire and vigor, is black as
night.To moderate the
impetuous bounds of the animal, Djalma uses a small steel bit, with
headstall and reins of twisted scarlet silk, fine as a thread.Not one of those admirable riders, sculptured so masterly on the frieze
of the Parthenon, sits his horse more gracefully and proudly than this
young Indian, whose fine face, illumined by the setting sun, is radiant
with serene happiness; his eyes sparkle with joy, and his dilated
nostrils and unclosed lips inhale with delight the balmy breeze, that
brings to him the perfume of flowers and the scent of fresh leaves, for
the trees are still moist from the abundant rain that fell after the
storm.A red cap, similar to that worn by the Greeks, surmounting the black
locks of Djalma, sets off to advantage the golden tint of his complexion;
his throat is bare; he is clad in his robe of white muslin with large
sleeves, confined at the waist by a scarlet sash; very full drawers, in
white cotton stuff, leave half uncovered his tawny and polished legs;
their classic curve stands out from the dark sides of the horse, which he
presses tightly between his muscular calves.He has no stirrups; his
foot, small and narrow, is shod with a sandal of morocco leather.The rush of his thoughts, by turns impetuous and restrained, was
expressed in some degree by the pace he imparted to his horse--now bold
and precipitate, like the flight of unbridled imagination--now calm and
measured, like the reflection which succeeds an idle dream.But, in all
this fantastic course, his least movements were distinguished by a proud,
independent and somewhat savage grace.Dispossessed of his paternal territory by the English, and at first
detained by them as a state-prisoner after the death of his father--who
(as M. Joshua Van Dael had written to M. Rodin) had fallen sword in
hand--Djalma had at length been restored to liberty.Abandoning the
continent of India, and still accompanied by General Simon, who had
lingered hard by the prison of his old friend's son, the young Indian
came next to Batavia, the birthplace of his mother, to collect the modest
inheritance of his maternal ancestors.And amongst this property, so long
despised or forgotten by his father, he found some important papers, and
a medal exactly similar to that worn by Rose and Blanche.General Simon was not more surprised than pleased at this discovery,
which not only established a tie of kindred between his wife and Djalma's
mother, but which also seemed to promise great advantages for the future.Leaving Djalma at Batavia, to terminate some business there, he had gone
to the neighboring island of Sumatra, in the hope of finding a vessel
that would make the passage to Europe directly and rapidly; for it was
now necessary that, cost what it might, the young Indian also should be
at Paris on the 13th February, 1832.Should General Simon find a vessel
ready to sail for Europe, he was to return immediately, to fetch Djalma;
and the latter, expecting him daily, was now going to the pier of
Batavia, hoping to see the father of Rose and Blanche arrive by the mail
boat from Sumatra.A few words are here necessary on the early life of the son of Kadja
sing.Having lost his mother very young, and brought up with rude simplicity,
he had accompanied his father, whilst yet a child, to the great tiger
hunts, as dangerous as battles; and, in the first dawn of youth, he had
followed him to the stern bloody war, which he waged in defence of his
country.Thus living, from the time of his mother's death, in the midst
of forests and mountains and continual combats, his vigorous and
ingenuous nature had preserved itself pure, and he well merited the name
of "The Generous" bestowed on him.Born a prince, he was--which by no
means follows--a prince indeed.During the period of his captivity, the
silent dignity of his bearing had overawed his jailers.Never a reproach,
never a complaint--a proud and melancholy calm was all that he opposed to
a treatment as unjust as it was barbarous, until he was restored to
freedom.Having thus been always accustomed to a patriarchal life, or to a war of
mountaineers, which he had only quitted to pass a few months in prison,
Djalma knew nothing, so to speak, of civilized society.Without its
exactly amounting to a defect, he certainly carried his good qualities to
their extreme limits.Obstinately faithful to his pledged word, devoted
to the death, confiding to blindness, good almost to a complete
forgetfulness of himself, he was inflexible towards ingratitude,
falsehood, or perfidy.He would have felt no compunction to sacrifice a
traitor, because, could he himself have committed a treason, he would
have thought it only just to expiate it with his life.He was, in a word, the man of natural feelings, absolute and entire.Such
a man, brought into contact with the temperaments, calculations,
falsehoods, deceptions, tricks, restrictions, and hollowness of a refined
society, such as Paris, for example, would, without doubt, form a very
curious subject for speculation.We raise this hypothesis, because, since
his journey to France had been determined on, Djalma had one fixed,
ardent desire--to be in Paris.In Paris--that enchanted city--of which, even in Asia, the land of
enchantment, so many marvelous tales were told.What chiefly inflamed the fresh, vivid imagination of the young Indian,
was the thought of French women--those attractive Parisian beauties,
miracles of elegance and grace, who eclipsed, he was informed, even the
magnificence of the capitals of the civilized world.And at this very
moment, in the brightness of that warm and splendid evening, surrounded
by the intoxication of flowers and perfumes, which accelerated the pulses
of his young fiery heart, Djalma was dreaming of those exquisite
creatures, whom his fancy loved to clothe in the most ideal garbs.It seemed to him as if, at the end of the avenue, in the midst of that
sheet of golden light, which the trees encompassed with their full, green
arch, he could see pass and repass, white and sylph-like, a host of
adorable and voluptuous phantoms, that threw him kisses from the tips of
their rosy fingers.Unable to restrain his burning emotions, carried away
by a strange enthusiasm, Djalma uttered exclamations of joy, deep, manly,
and sonorous, and made his vigorous courser bound under him in the
excitement of a mad delight.Just then a sunbeam, piercing the dark vault
of the avenue, shone full upon him.For several minutes, a man had been advancing rapidly along a path,
which, at its termination, intersected the avenue diagonally.He stopped
a moment in the shade, looking at Djalma with astonishment.It was indeed
a charming sight, to behold, in the midst of a blaze of dazzling lustre,
this youth, so handsome, joyous, and ardent, clad in his white and
flowing vestments, gayly and lightly seated on his proud black mare, who
covered her red bridle with her foam, and whose long tail and thick mane
floated on the evening breeze.But, with that reaction which takes place in all human desires, Djalma
soon felt stealing over him a sentiment of soft, undefinable melancholy.He raised his hand to his eyes, now dimmed with moisture, and allowed the
reins to fall on the mane of his docile steed, which, instantly stopping,
stretched out its long neck, and turned its head in the direction of the
personage, whom it could see approaching through the coppice.This man, Mahal the Smuggler, was dressed nearly like European sailors.He wore jacket and trousers of white duck, a broad red sash, and a very
low-crowned straw hat.His face was brown, with strongly-marked features,
and, though forty years of age, he was quite beardless.In another moment, Mahal was close to the young Indian."You are Prince
Djalma?"said he, in not very good French, raising his hand respectfully
to his hat."You are the son of Kadja-sing?""You are going to meet him, as you have gone every evening, since you
expect his return from Sumatra?""Yes, but how do you know all this?"said the Indian looking at the
Smuggler with as much surprise as curiosity."Is he not to land at Batavia, to-day or to-morrow?""Perhaps," said Mahal, with a distrustful air."But are you really the
son of Kadja-sing?""Yes, I tell you--but where have you seen General Simon?""If you are the son of Kadja-sing," resumed Mahal, continuing to regard
Djalma with a suspicious eye, "what is your surname?""My sire was called the 'Father of the Generous,'" answered the young
Indian, as a shade of sorrow passed over his fine countenance.These words appeared in part to convince Mahal of the identity of Djalma;
but, wishing doubtless to be still more certain, he resumed: "You must
have received, two days ago, a letter from General Simon, written from
Sumatra?""To assure myself that you are really the son of Kadja-sing, and to
execute the orders I have received.""When I have proof that you are Prince Djalma, I will tell you.I was
informed that you would be mounted on a black mare, with a red bridle.But--"

"By the soul of my mother!"I will tell you all--if you can tell me what was the printed paper,
contained in the last letter that General Simon wrote you from Sumatra.""It was a cutting from a French newspaper.""Did it announce good or bad news for the general?""Good news--for it related that, during his absence, they had
acknowledged the last rank and title bestowed on him by the Emperor, as
they had done for others of his brothers in arms, exiled like him.""You are indeed Prince Djalma," said the Smuggler, after a moment's
reflection.General Simon landed last night in Java, but on
a desert part of the coast."exclaimed Djalma, in amazement; "why?"asked Djalma, growing pale with alarm."He is three leagues hence--near the sea-shore--in the ruins of Tchandi."repeated Djalma, and his countenance expressed
increasing surprise and anxiety."Without being certain, I think it is because of a duel he fought in
Sumatra," said the Smuggler, mysteriously."I don't know--I am not at all certain on the subject.But do you know
the ruins of Tchandi?""The general expects you there; that is what he ordered me to tell you.""So you came with him from Sumatra?""I was pilot of the little smuggling coaster, that landed him in the
night on a lonely beach.He knew that you went every day to the mole, to
wait for him; I was almost sure that I should meet you.He gave me
details about the letter you received from him as a proof that he had
sent me.If he could have found the means of writing, he would have
written.""But he did not tell you why he was obliged to hide himself?"Certain words made me suspect what I told you--a
duel."Knowing the mettle of General Simon, Djalma thought the suspicions of the
Smuggler not unfounded.After a moment's silence he said to him: "Can you
undertake to lead home my horse?My dwelling is without the town--there,
in the midst of those trees--by the side of the new mosque.In ascending
the mountain of Tchandi, my horse would be in my way; I shall go much
faster on foot.""I know where you live; General Simon told me.I should have gone there
if I had not met you.Djalma sprang lightly to the ground, threw the bridle to Mahal, unrolled
one end of his sash, took out a silk purse, and gave it to the Smuggler,
saying: "You have been faithful and obedient.Here!--it is a trifle--but
I have no more.""Kadja-sing was rightly called the 'Father of the Generous,'" said the
Smuggler, bowing with respect and gratitude.He took the road to Batavia,
leading Djalma's horse.The young Indian, on the contrary, plunged into
the coppice, and, walking with great strides, he directed his course
towards the mountain, on which were the ruins of Tchandi, where he could
not arrive before night.M. JOSHUA VAN DAEL.M. Joshua Van Dael a Dutch merchant, and correspondent of M. Rodin, was
born at Batavia, the capital of the island of Java; his parents had sent
him to be educated at Pondicherry, in a celebrated religious house, long
established in that place, and belonging to the "Society of Jesus."It
was there that he was initiated into the order as "professor of the three
vows," or lay member, commonly called "temporal coadjutor."Joshua was a man of probity that passed for stainless; of strict accuracy
in business, cold, careful, reserved, and remarkably skillful and
sagacious; his financial operations were almost always successful, for a
protecting power gave him ever in time, knowledge of events which might
advantageously influence his commercial transactions.The religious house
of Pondicherry was interested in his affairs, having charged him with the
exportation and exchange of the produce of its large possessions in this
colony.Speaking little, hearing much, never disputing, polite in the
extreme--giving seldom, but with choice and purpose--Joshua, without
inspiring sympathy, commanded generally that cold respect, which is
always paid to the rigid moralist; for instead of yielding to the
influence of lax and dissolute colonial manners, he appeared to live with
great regularity, and his exterior had something of austerity about it,
which tended to overawe.The following scene took place at Batavia, while Djalma was on his way to
the ruins of Tchandi in the hope of meeting General Simon.M. Joshua had just retired into his cabinet, in which were many shelves
filled with paper boxes, and huge ledgers and cash boxes lying open upon
desks.The only window of this apartment, which was on the ground floor,
looked out upon a narrow empty court, and was protected externally by
strong iron bars; instead of glass, it was fitted with a Venetian blind,
because of the extreme heat of the climate.M. Joshua, having placed upon his desk a taper in a glass globe, looked
at the clock.Saying this, he went out, passing through an antechamber, opened a second
thick door, studded with nail-heads, in the Dutch fashion, cautiously
entered the court (so as not to be heard by the people in the house), and
drew back the secret bolt of a gate six feet high, formidably garnished
with iron spikes.Leaving this gate unfastened, he regained his cabinet,
after he had successively and carefully closed the two other doors behind
him.M. Joshua next seated himself at his desk, and took from a drawer a long
letter, or rather statement, commenced some time before, and continued
day by day.It is superfluous to observe, that the letter already
mentioned, as addressed to M. Rodin, was anterior to the liberation of
Djalma and his arrival at Batavia.The present statement was also addressed to M. Rodin, and Van Dael thus
went on with it:

"Fearing the return of General Simon, of which I had been informed by
intercepting his letters--I have already told you, that I had succeeded
in being employed by him as his agent here; having then read his letters,
and sent them on as if untouched to Djalma, I felt myself obliged, from
the pressure of the circumstances, to have recourse to extreme
measures--taking care always to preserve appearances, and rendering at
the same time a signal service to humanity, which last reason chiefly
decided me."A new danger imperiously commanded these measures.The steamship
'Ruyter' came in yesterday, and sails tomorrow in the course of the day.She is to make the voyage to Europe via the Arabian Gulf; her passengers
will disembark at Suez, cross the Isthmus, and go on board another vessel
at Alexandria, which will bring them to France.This voyage, as rapid as
it is direct, will not take more than seven or eight weeks.We are now at
the end of October; Prince Djalma might then be in France by the
commencement of the month of January; and according to your instructions,
of which I know not the motive, but which I execute with zeal and
submission, his departure must be prevented at all hazards, because, you
tell me, some of the gravest interests of the Society would be
compromised, by the arrival of this young Indian in Paris before the 13th
of February.Now, if I succeed, as I hope, in making him miss this
opportunity of the 'Ruyter' it will be materially impossible for him to
arrive in France before the month of April; for the 'Ruyter' is the only
vessel which makes the direct passage, the others taking at least four or
five months to reach Europe."Before telling you the means which I have thought right to employ, to
detain Prince Djalma--of the success of which means I am yet
uncertain--it is well that you should be acquainted with the following
facts."They have just discovered, in British India, a community whose members
call themselves 'Brothers of the Good Work,' or 'Phansegars,' which
signifies simply 'Thugs' or 'Stranglers;' these murderers do not shed
blood, but strangle their victims, less for the purpose of robbing them,
than in obedience to a homicidal vocation, and to the laws of an infernal
divinity named by them 'Bowanee.'"I cannot better give you an idea of this horrible sect, than by
transcribing here some lines from the introduction of a report by Colonel
Sleeman, who has hunted out this dark association with indefatigable
zeal.The report in question was published about two months ago.Here is
the extract; it is the colonel who speaks:

"'From 1822 to 1824, when I was charged with the magistracy and civil
administration of the district of Nersingpore, not a murder, not the
least robbery was committed by an ordinary criminal, without my being
immediately informed of it; but if any one had come and told me at this
period, that a band of hereditary assassins by profession lived in the
village of Kundelie, within about four hundred yards of my court of
justice--that the beautiful groves of the village of Mundesoor, within a
day's march of my residence, formed one of the most frightful marts of
assassination in all India--that numerous bands of 'Brothers of the Good
Work,' coming from Hindostan and the Deccan, met annually beneath these
shades, as at a solemn festival, to exercise their dreadful vocation upon
all the roads which cross each other in this locality--I should have
taken such a person for a madman, or one who had been imposed upon by
idle tales.And yet nothing could be truer; hundreds of travellers had
been buried every year in the groves of Mundesoor; a whole tribe of
assassins lived close to my door, at the very time I was supreme
magistrate of the province, and extended their devastations to the cities
of Poonah and Hyderabad.I shall never forget, when, to convince me of
the fact, one of the chiefs of the Stranglers, who had turned informer
against them, caused thirteen bodies to be dug up from the ground beneath
my tent, and offered to produce any number from the soil in the immediate
vicinity.'[5]

"These few words of Colonel Sleeman will give some idea of this dread
society, which has its laws, duties, customs, opposed to all other laws,
human and divine.Devoted to each other, even to heroism, blindly
obedient to their chiefs, who profess themselves the immediate
representatives of their dark divinity, regarding as enemies all who do
not belong to them, gaining recruits everywhere by a frightful system of
proselytising--these apostles of a religion of murder go preaching their
abominable doctrines in the shade, and spreading their immense net over
the whole of India."Three of their principal chiefs, and one of their adepts, flying from
the determined pursuit of the English governor-general, having succeeded
in making their escape, had arrived at the Straits of Malacca, at no
great distance from our island; a smuggler, who is also something of a
pirate, attached to their association, and by name Mahal, took them on
board his coasting vessel, and brought them hither, where they think
themselves for some time in safety--as, following the advice of the
smuggler, they lie concealed in a thick forest, in which are many ruined
temples and numerous subterranean retreats."Amongst these chiefs, all three remarkably intelligent, there is one in
particular, named Faringhea, whose extraordinary energy and eminent
qualities make him every way redoubtable.He is of the mixed race, half
white and Hindoo, has long inhabited towns in which are European
factories and speaks English and French very well.The other two chiefs
are a <DW64> and a Hindoo; the adept is a Malay."The smuggler, Mahal, considering that he could obtain a large reward by
giving up these three chiefs and their adept, came to me, knowing, as all
the world knows, my intimate relations with a person who has great
influence with our governor.Two days ago, he offered me, on certain
conditions, to deliver up the <DW64>, the half-caste, the Hindoo, and the
Malay.These conditions are--a considerable sum of money, and a free
passage on board a vessel sailing for Europe or America, in order to
escape the implacable vengeance of the Thugs."I joyfully seized the occasion to hand over three such murderers to
human justice, and I promised Mahal to arrange matters for him with the
governor, but also on certain conditions, innocent in themselves, and
which concerned Djalma.Should my project succeed, I will explain myself
more at length; I shall soon know the result, for I expect Mahal every
minute."But before I close these despatches, which are to go tomorrow by the
'Ruyter'--in which vessel I have also engaged a passage for Mahal the
Smuggler, in the event of the success of my plans--I must include in
parentheses a subject of some importance."In my last letter, in which I announced to you the death of Djalma's
father, and his own imprisonment by the English, I asked for some
information as to the solvency of Baron Tripeaud, banker and manufacturer
at Paris, who has also an agency at Calcutta.This information will now
be useless, if what I have just learned should, unfortunately, turn out
to be correct, and it will be for you to act according to circumstances."This house at Calcutta owes considerable sums both to me and our
colleague at Pondicherry, and it is said that M. Tripeaud has involved
himself to a dangerous extent in attempting to ruin, by opposition, a
very flourishing establishment, founded some time ago by M. Francois
Hardy, an eminent manufacturer.I am assured that M. Tripeaud has already
sunk and lost a large capital in this enterprise: he has no doubt done a
great deal of harm to M. Francois Hardy; but he has also, they say,
seriously compromised his own fortune--and, were he to fail, the effects
of his disaster would be very fatal to us, seeing that he owes a large
sum of money to me and to us."In this state of things it would be very desirable if, by the employment
of the powerful means of every kind at our disposal, we could completely
discredit and break down the house of M. Francois Hardy, already shaken
by M. Tripeaud's violent opposition.In that case, the latter would soon
regain all he has lost; the ruin of his rival would insure his
prosperity, and our demands would be securely covered."Doubtless, it is painful, it is sad, to be obliged to have recourse to
these extreme measures, only to get back our own; but, in these days, are
we not surely justified in sometimes using the arms that are incessantly
turned against us?If we are reduced to such steps by the injustice and
wickedness of men, we may console ourselves with the reflection that we
only seek to preserve our worldly possessions, in order to devote them to
the greater glory of God; whilst, in the hands of our enemies, those very
goods are the dangerous instruments of perdition and scandal."After all it is merely a humble proposition that I submit to you.Were
it in my power to take an active part in the matter, I should do nothing
of myself.It belongs, with all I possess, to
those whom I have sworn absolute obedience."Here a slight noise interrupted M. Joshua, and drew his attention from
his work.He rose abruptly, and went straight to the window.Three gentle
taps were given on the outside of one of the slats of the blind.asked M. Joshua, in a low voice."It is I," was answered from without, also in a low tone.cried M. Joshua, with an expression of great satisfaction; "are
you sure of it?""Quite sure: there is no devil more clever and intrepid.""The parts of the letter, which I quoted, convinced him that I came from
General Simon, and that he would find him at the ruins of Tchandi.""Therefore, at this moment--"

"Djalma goes to the ruins, where he will encounter the black, the half
blood, and the Indian.It is there they have appointed to meet the Malay,
who tattooed the prince during his sleep.""Have you been to examine the subterraneous passage?"One of the stones of the pedestal of the statue
turns upon itself; the stairs are large; it will do.""None--I saw them in the morning--and this evening the Malay came to tell
me all, before he went to join them at the ruins of Tchandi--for he had
remained hidden amongst the bushes, not daring to go there in the
daytime.""Mahal--if you have told the truth, and if all succeed--your pardon and
ample reward are assured to you.Your berth has been taken on board the
'Ruyter;' you will sail to-morrow; you will thus be safe from the malice
of the Stranglers, who would follow you hither to revenge the death of
their chiefs, Providence having chosen you to deliver those three great
criminals to justice.Heaven will bless you!--Go and wait for me at the
door of the governor's house; I will introduce you.The matter is so
important that I do not hesitate to disturb him thus late in the night.Go quickly!--I will follow on my side."The steps of Mahal were distinctly audible, as he withdrew precipitately,
and then silence reigned once more in the house.Joshua returned to his
desk, and hastily added these words to the despatch, which he had before
commenced:

"Whatever may now happen, it will be impossible for Djalma to leave
Batavia at present.You may rest quite satisfied; he will not be at Paris
by the 13th of next February.As I foresaw, I shall have to be up all
night.--I am just going to the governor's.To-morrow I will add a few
lines to this long statement, which the steamship 'Ruyter' will convey to
Europe."Having locked up his papers, Joshua rang the bell loudly, and, to the
great astonishment of his servants, not accustomed to see him leave home
in the middle of the night, went in all haste to the residence of the
governor of the island.We now conduct the reader to the ruins of Tchandi.[5] This report is extracted from Count Edward de Warren's excellent work,
"British India in 1831."--E.To the storm in the middle of the day, the approach of which so well
served the Strangler's designs upon Djalma, has succeeded a calm and
serene night.The disk of the moon rises slowly behind a mass of lofty
ruins, situated on a hill, in the midst of a thick wood, about three
leagues from Batavia.Long ranges of stone, high walls of brick, fretted away by time,
porticoes covered with parasitical vegetation, stand out boldly from the
sheet of silver light which blends the horizon with the limpid blue of
the heavens.Some rays of the moon, gliding through the opening on one of
these porticoes, fall upon two colossal statues at the foot of an immense
staircase, the loose stones of which are almost entirely concealed by
grass, moss, and brambles.The fragments of one of these statues, broken in the middle, lie strewed
upon the ground; the other, which remains whole and standing, is
frightful to behold.It represents a man of gigantic proportions, with a
head three feet high; the expression of the countenance is ferocious,
eyes of brilliant slaty black are set beneath gray brows, the large, deep
mouth gapes immoderately, and reptiles have made their nest between the
lips of stone; by the light of the moon, a hideous swarm is there dimly
visible.A broad girdle, adorned with symbolic ornaments, encircles the
body of this statue, and fastens a long sword to its right side.The
giant has four extended arms, and, in his great hands, he bears an
elephant's head, a twisted serpent, a human skull, and a bird resembling
a heron.The moon, shedding her light on the profile of this statue,
serves to augment the weirdness of its aspect.Here and there, enclosed in the half-crumbling walls of brick, are
fragments of stone bas-reliefs, very boldly cut; one of those in the best
preservation represents a man with the head of an elephant, and the wings
of a bat, devouring a child.Nothing can be more gloomy than these ruins,
buried among thick trees of a dark green, covered with frightful emblems,
and seen by the moonlight, in the midst of the deep silence of night.Against one of the walls of this ancient temple, dedicated to some
mysterious and bloody Javanese divinity, leans a kind of hut, rudely
constructed of fragments of brick and stone; the door, made of woven
rushes, is open, and a red light streams from it, which throws its rays
on the tall grass that covers the ground.Three men are assembled in this
hovel, around a clay-lamp, with a wick of cocoanut fibre steeped in
palm-oil.The first of these three, about forty years of age, is poorly clad in the
European fashion; his pale, almost white, complexion, announces that he
belongs to the mixed race, being offspring of a white father and Indian
mother.The second is a robust African <DW64>, with thick lips, vigorous
shoulders, and lank legs; his woolly hair is beginning to turn gray; he
is covered with rags, and stands close beside the Indian.The third
personage is asleep, and stretched on a mat in the corner of the hovel.These three men are the three Thuggee chiefs, who, obliged to fly from
the continent of India, have taken refuge in Java, under the guidance of
Mahal the Smuggler."The Malay does not return," said the half-blood, named Faringhea, the
most redoubtable chief of this homicidal sect: "in executing our orders,
he has perhaps been killed by Djalma.""The storm of this morning brought every reptile out of the earth," said
the <DW64>; "the Malay must have been bitten, and his body ere now a nest
of serpents.""To serve the good work," proceeded Faringhea, with a gloomy air, "one
must know how to brave death.""And to inflict it," added the <DW64>.A stifled cry, followed by some inarticulate words, here drew the
attention of these two men, who hastily turned their heads in the
direction of the sleeper.His
beardless face, of a bright copper color, his robe of coarse stuff, his
turban striped brown and yellow, showed that he belonged to the pure
Hindoo race.His sleep appeared agitated by some painful vision; an
abundant sweat streamed over his countenance, contracted by terror; he
spoke in his dream, but his words were brief and broken, and accompanied
with convulsive starts.said Faringhea to the <DW64>."Do you not remember, how, five years ago, that savage, Colonel Kennedy,
butcher of the Indians, came to the banks of the Ganges, to hunt the
tiger, with twenty horses, four elephants, and fifty servants?""Yes, yes," said the <DW64>; "and we three, hunters of men, made a better
day's sport than he did.Kennedy, his horses, his elephants, and his
numerous servants did not get their tiger--but we got ours," he added,
with grim irony."Yes; Kennedy, that tiger with a human face, fell into
our ambush, and the brothers of the good work offered up their fine prey
to our goddess Bowanee.""If you remember, it was just at the moment when we gave the last tug to
the cord round Kennedy's neck, that we perceived on a sudden a traveller
close at hand.He had seen us, and it was necessary to make away with
him.Now, since that time," added Faringhea, "the remembrance of the
murder of that man pursues our brother in his dreams," and he pointed to
the sleeping Indian."And even when he is awake," said the <DW64>, looking at Faringhea with a
significant air.said the other, again pointing to the Indian, who, in the
agitation of his dream, recommenced talking in abrupt sentences; "listen!he is repeating the answers of the traveller, when we told him he must
die, or serve with us on Thuggee.His mind is still impressed--deeply
impressed--with those words."And, in fact, the Indian repeated aloud in his sleep, a sort of
mysterious dialogue, of which he himself supplied both questions and
answers."'Traveller,' said he, in a voice broken by sudden pauses, 'why that
black mark on your forehead, stretching from one temple to the other?It
is a mark of doom and your look is sad as death.Come with us; Kallee will avenge you.--'Yes, I have
greatly suffered.'--'Yes, for a very long
time.'--What do you reserve for
those who injure you?'--'Will you not render blow for
blow?'--'Who are you, then, that render
good for evil?'--'I am one who loves, and suffers, and forgives.'"said the <DW64> to Faringhea; "he has not
forgotten the words of the traveller before his death."Still under the influence of his dream, the Indian continued:

"'Traveller, we are three; we are brave; we have your life in our
hands--you have seen us sacrifice to the good work.Be one of us, or
die--die--die!Not thus--do not look at me thus!'"As he
uttered these last words, the Indian made a sudden movement, as if to
keep off some approaching object, and awoke with a start.Then, passing
his hand over his moist forehead, he looked round him with a bewildered
eye."For a bold hunter of
men, you have a weak head.Luckily, you have a strong heart and arm."The other remained a moment silent, his face buried in his hands; then he
replied: "It is long since I last dreamed of that traveller."said Faringhea, shrugging his shoulders."Did you not
yourself throw the cord around his neck?""Did we not dig his grave by the side of Colonel Kennedy's?Did we not
bury him with the English butcher, under the sand and the rushes?""Yes, we dug his grave," said the Indian, trembling; "and yet, only a
year ago, I was seated one evening at the gate of Bombay, waiting for one
of our brothers--the sun was setting behind the pagoda, to the right of
the little hill--the scene is all before me now--I was seated under a
figtree--when I heard a slow, firm, even step, and, as I turned round my
head--I saw him--coming out of the town.""A vision," said the <DW64>; "always the same vision!""A vision," added Faringhea, "or a vague resemblance.""I knew him by the black mark on his forehead; it was none but he.I
remained motionless with fear, gazing at him with eyes aghast.He
stopped, bending upon me his calm, sad look.In spite of myself, I could
not help exclaiming: 'It is he!'--'Yes,' he replied, in his gentle voice,
'it is I. Since all whom thou killest must needs live again,' and he
pointed to heaven as he spoke, 'why shouldst thou kill?--Hear me!I have
just come from Java; I am going to the other end of the world, to a
country of never-melting snow; but, here or there, on plains of fire or
plains of ice, I shall still be the same.Even so is it with the souls of
those who fall beneath thy kalleepra; in this world or up above, in this
garb or in another, the soul must still be a soul; thou canst not smite
it.--and shaking his head sorrowfully, he went on his
way, walking slowly, with downcast eyes; he ascended the hill of the
pagoda; I watched him as he went, without being able to move: at the
moment the sun set, he was standing on the summit of the hill, his tall
figure thrown out against the sky--and so he disappeared.added the Indian with a shudder, after a long pause: "it was none but
he."In this story the Indian had never varied, though he had often
entertained his companions with the same mysterious adventure.This
persistency on his part had the effect of shaking their incredulity, or
at least of inducing them to seek some natural cause for this apparently
superhuman event."Perhaps," said Faringhea, after a moment's reflection, "the knot round
the traveller's neck got jammed, and some breath was left him, the air
may have penetrated the rushes with which we covered his grave, and so
life have returned to him.""No, no," said the Indian, shaking his head, "this man is not of our
race."said the Indian, in a solemn voice; "the number of victims that
the children of Bowanee have sacrificed since the commencement of ages,
is nothing compared to the immense heap of dead and dying, whom this
terrible traveller leaves behind him in his murderous march."cried the <DW64> and Faringhea.repeated the Hindoo, with a convinced accent, that made its
impression upon his companions."Hear me and tremble!--When I met this
traveller at the gates of Bombay, he came from Java, and was going
towards the north, he said.The very next day, the town was a prey to the
cholera, and we learned sometime after, that this plague had first broken
out here, in Java.""That is true," said the <DW64>."'I am going towards the
north, to a country of eternal snow,' said the traveller to me.The
cholera also went towards the north, passing through Muscat--Ispahan
--Tauris--Tiflis--till it overwhelmed Siberia.""True," said Faringhea, becoming thoughtful:

"And the cholera," resumed the Indian, "only travelled its five or six
leagues a day--a man's tramp--never appeared in two places at once--but
swept on slowly, steadily,--even as a man proceeds."At the mention of this strange coincidence, the Hindoo's companions
looked at each other in amazement.After a silence of some minutes, the
awe-struck <DW64> said to the last speaker: "So you think that this man--"

"I think that this man, whom we killed, restored to life by some infernal
divinity, has been commissioned to bear this terrible scourge over the
earth, and to scatter round his steps that death, from which he is
himself secure.added the Indian, with gloomy enthusiasm,
"this awful wayfarer passed through Java--the cholera wasted Java.He
passed through Bombay--the cholera wasted Bombay.He went towards the
north--the cholera wasted the north."So saying, the Indian fell into a profound reverie.The <DW64> and
Faringhea were seized with gloomy astonishment.The Indian spoke the truth as to the mysterious march (still unexplained)
of that fearful malady, which has never been known to travel more than
five or six leagues a day, or to appear simultaneously in two spots.Nothing can be more curious, than to trace out, on the maps prepared at
the period in question, the slow, progressive course of this travelling
pestilence, which offers to the astonished eye all the capricious
incidents of a tourist's journey.Passing this way rather than
that--selecting provinces in a country--towns in a province--one quarter
in a town--one street in a quarter--one house in a street--having its
place of residence and repose, and then continuing its slow, mysterious,
fear inspiring march.The words of the Hindoo, by drawing attention to these dreadful
eccentricities, made a strong impression upon the minds of the <DW64> and
Faringhea--wild natures, brought by horrible doctrines to the monomania
of murder.Yes--for this also is an established fact--there have been in India
members of an abominable community, who killed without motive, without
passion--killed for the sake of killing--for the pleasure of murder--to
substitute death for life--to make of a living man a corpse, as they have
themselves declared in one of their examinations.The mind loses itself in the attempt to penetrate the causes of these
monstrous phenomena.By what incredible series of events, have men been
induced to devote themselves to this priesthood of destruction?Without
doubt, such a religion could only flourish in countries given up, like
India, to the most atrocious slavery, and to the most merciless iniquity
of man to man.Such a creed!--is it not the hate of exasperated humanity, wound up to
its highest pitch by oppression?--May not this homicidal sect, whose
origin is lost in the night of ages, have been perpetuated in these
regions, as the only possible protest of slavery against despotism?May
not an inscrutable wisdom have here made Phansegars, even as are made
tigers and serpents?What is most remarkable in this awful sect, is the mysterious bond,
which, uniting its members amongst themselves, separates them from all
other men.They have laws and customs of their own, they support and help
each other, but for them there is neither country nor family; they owe no
allegiance save to a dark, invisible power, whose decrees they obey with
blind submission, and in whose name they spread themselves abroad, to
make corpses, according to their own savage expression.[6]

For some moments the three Stranglers had maintained a profound silence.Outside the hut, the moon continued to throw great masses of white
radiance, and tall bluish shadows, over the imposing fabric of the ruins;
the stars sparkled in the heavens; from time to time, a faint breeze
rustled through the thick and varnished leaves of the bananas and the
palms.The pedestal of the gigantic statue, which, still entire, stood on the
left side of the portico, rested upon large flagstones, half hidden with
brambles.Suddenly, one of these stones appeared to fall in; and from the
aperture, which thus formed itself without noise, a man, dressed in
uniform, half protruded his body, looked carefully around him, and
listened.Seeing the rays of the lamp, which lighted the interior of the hovel,
tremble upon the tall grass, he turned round to make a signal, and soon,
accompanied by two other soldiers, he ascended, with the greatest silence
and precaution, the last steps of the subterranean staircase, and went
gliding amongst the ruins.For a few moments, their moving shadows were
thrown upon the moonlit ground; then they disappeared behind some
fragments of broken wall.At the instant when the large stone resumed its place and level, the
heads of many other soldiers might have been seen lying close in the
excavation.The half-caste, the Indian, and the <DW64>, still seated
thoughtfully in the hut, did not perceive what was passing.[6] The following are some passages from the Count de Warren's very
curious book, "British India in 1831:" "Besides the robbers, who kill for
the sake of the booty they hope to find upon travellers, there is a class
of assassins, forming an organized society, with chiefs of their own, a
slang-language, a science, a free-masonry, and even a religion, which has
its fanaticism and its devotion, its agents, emissaries, allies, its
militant forces, and its passive adherents, who contribute their money to
the good work.This is the community of the Thugs or Phansegars
(deceivers or stranglers, from thugna, to deceive, and phansna, to
strangle), a religious and economical society, which speculates with the
human race by exterminating men; its origin is lost in the night of ages."Until 1810 their existence was unknown, not only to the European
conquerors, but even to the native governments.Between the years 1816
and 1830, several of their bands were taken in the act, and punished: but
until this last epoch, all the revelations made on the subject by
officers of great experience, had appeared too monstrous to obtain the
attention or belief of the public; they had been rejected and despised as
the dreams of a heated imagination.And yet for many years, at the very
least for half a century, this social wound had been frightfully on the
increase, devouring the population from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin and
from Cutch to Assam."It was in the year 1830 that the revelations of a celebrated chief,
whose life was spared on condition of his denouncing his accomplices,
laid bare the whole system.The basis of the Thuggee Society is a
religious belief--the worship of Bowanee, a gloomy divinity, who is only
pleased with carnage, and detests above all things the human race.Her
most agreeable sacrifices are human victims, and the more of these her
disciple may have offered up in this world the more he will be
recompensed in the next by all the delights of soul and sense, by women
always beautiful, and joys eternally renewed.If the assassin meets the
scaffold in his career, he dies with the enthusiasm of a martyr, because
he expects his reward.To obey his divine mistress, he murders, without
anger and without remorse, the old man, woman and child; whilst, to his
fellow-religionists, he may be charitable, humane, generous, devoted, and
may share all in common with them, because, like himself, they are the
ministers and adopted children of Bowanee.The destruction of his
fellow-creatures, not belonging to his community--the diminution of the
human race--that is the primary object of his pursuit; it is not as a
means of gain, for though plunder may be a frequent, and doubtless an
agreeable accessory, it is only secondary in his estimation.Destruction
is his end, his celestial mission, his calling; it is also a delicious
passion, the most captivating of all sports--this hunting of men!--'You
find great pleasure,' said one of those that were condemned, 'in tracking
the wild beast to his den, in attacking the boar, the tiger, because
there is danger to brave, energy and courage to display.Think how this
attraction must be redoubled, when the contest is with man, when it is
man that is to be destroyed.Instead of the single faculty of courage,
all must be called into action--courage, cunning, foresight, eloquence,
intrigue.To sport
with all the passions, to touch the chords of love and friendship, and so
draw the prey into one's net--that is a glorious chase--it is a delight,
a rapture, I tell you!'"Whoever was in India in the years 1831 and 1832, must remember the
stupor and affright, which the discovery of this vast infernal machine
spread through all classes of society.A great number of magistrates and
administrators of provinces refused to believe in it, and could not be
brought to comprehend that such a system had so long preyed on the body
politic, under their eyes as it were, silently, and without betraying
itself."--See "British India in 183," by Count Edward de Warren, 2 vols.THE AMBUSCADE

The half-blood Faringhea, wishing doubtless to escape from the dark
thoughts which the words of the Indian on the mysterious course of the
Cholera had raised within him, abruptly changed the subject of
conversation.His eye shone with lurid fire, and his countenance took an
expression of savage enthusiasm, as he cried: "Bowanee will always watch
over us, intrepid hunters of men!The world
is large; our prey is everywhere.The English may force us to quit India,
three chiefs of the good work--but what matter?We leave there our
brethren, secret, numerous, and terrible, as black scorpions, whose
presence is only known by their mortal sting.said he to the Hindoo, with an
inspired air.Wherever men are to be found, there must
be oppressors and victims--wherever there are victims, there must be
hearts swollen with hate--it is for us to inflame that hate with all the
ardor of vengeance!It is for us, servants of Bowanee, to draw towards
us, by seducing wiles, all whose zeal, courage, and audacity may be
useful to the cause.Let us rival each other in devotion and sacrifices;
let us lend each other strength, help, support!That all who are not with
us may be our prey, let us stand alone in the midst of all, against all,
and in spite of all.For us, there must be neither country nor family.Our family is composed of our brethren; our country is the world."This kind of savage eloquence made a deep impression on the <DW64> and the
Indian, over whom Faringhea generally exercised considerable influence,
his intellectual powers being very superior to theirs, though they were
themselves two of the most eminent chiefs of this bloody association.cried the Indian, sharing the enthusiasm
of Faringhea; "the world is ours.Even here, in Java, let us leave some
trace of our passage.Before we depart, let us establish the good work in
this island; it will increase quickly, for here also is great misery, and
the Dutch are rapacious as the English.Brother, I have seen in the
marshy rice-fields of this island, always fatal to those who cultivate
them, men whom absolute want forced to the deadly task--they were livid
as corpses--some of them worn out with sickness, fatigue, and hunger,
fell--never to rise again.Brothers, the good work will prosper in this
country!""The other evening," said the half-caste, "I was on the banks of the
lake, behind a rock; a young woman came there--a few rags hardly covered
her lean and sun-scorched body--in her arms she held a little child,
which she pressed weeping to her milkless breast.She kissed it three
times, and said to it: 'You, at least, shall not be so unhappy as your
father'--and she threw it into the lake.It uttered one wail, and
disappeared.On this cry, the alligators, hidden amongst the reeds,
leaped joyfully into the water.There are mothers here who kill their
children out of pity.--Brothers, the good work will prosper in this
country!""This morning," said the <DW64>, "whilst they tore the flesh of one of his
black slaves with whips, a withered old merchant of Batavia left his
country-house to come to the town.Lolling in his palanquin, he received,
with languid indolence, the sad caresses of two of those girls, whom he
had bought, to people his harem, from parents too poor to give them food.The palanquin, which held this little old man, and the girls, was carried
by twelve young and robust men.There are here, you see, mothers who in
their misery sell their own daughters--slaves that are scourged--men that
carry other men, like beasts of burden.--Brothers, the good work will
prosper in this country!""Yes, in this country--and in every land of oppression, distress,
corruption, and slavery.""Could we but induce Djalma to join us, as Mahal the Smuggler advised,"
said the Indian, "our voyage to Java would doubly profit us; for we
should then number among our band this brave and enterprising youth, who
has so many motives to hate mankind.""He will soon be here; let us envenom his resentments.""Remind him of his father's death!""Only let hatred inflame his heart, and he will be ours."The <DW64>, who had remained for some time lost in thought, said suddenly:
"Brothers, suppose Mahal the Smuggler were to betray us?""He" cried the Hindoo, almost with indignation; "he gave us an asylum on
board his bark; he secured our flight from the Continent; he is again to
take us with him to Bombay, where we shall find vessels for America,
Europe, Africa.""What interest would Mahal have to betray us?""Nothing
could save him from the vengeance of the sons of Bowanee, and that he
knows.""Well," said the black, "he promised to get Djalma to come hither this
evening, and, once amongst us, he must needs be our own.""Was it not the Smuggler who told us to order the Malay to enter the
ajoupa of Djalma, to surprise him during his sleep, and, instead of
killing him as he might have done, to trace the name of Bowanee upon his
arm?Djalma will thus learn to judge of the resolution, the cunning and
obedience of our brethren, and he will understand what he has to hope or
fear from such men.Be it through admiration or through terror, he must
become one of us.""But if he refuses to join us, notwithstanding the reasons he has to hate
mankind?""Then--Bowanee will decide his fate," said Faringhea, with a gloomy look;
"I have my plan.""But will the Malay succeed in surprising Djalma during his sleep?""There is none nobler, more agile, more dexterous, than the Malay," said
Faringhea."He once had the daring to surprise in her den a black
panther, as she suckled her cub.He killed the dam, and took away the
young one, which he afterwards sold to some European ship's captain."exclaimed the Indian, listening to a singular
kind of hoot, which sounded through the profound silence of the night and
of the woods."Yes, it is the scream of the vulture seizing its prey," said the <DW64>,
listening in his turn; "it is also the signal of our brethren, after they
have seized their prey."In a few minutes, the Malay appeared at the door of the hut.He had wound
around him a broad length of cotton, adorned with bright  stripes."Well," said the <DW64>, anxiously; "have you succeeded?""Djalma must bear all his life the mark of the good work," said the
Malay, proudly."To reach him, I was forced to offer up to Bowanee a man
who crossed my path--I have left his body under the brambles, near the
ajoupa.But Djalma is marked with the sign.Mahal the Smuggler was the
first to know it."said the Indian, confounded by the Malay's
adroitness."Had he awoke," replied the other, calmly, "I should have been a dead
man--as I was charged to spare his life.""Because his life may be more useful to us than his death," said the
half-caste.Then, addressing the Malay, he added: "Brother, in risking
life for the good work, you have done to-day what we did yesterday, what
we may do again to-morrow.This time, you obey; another you will
command.""We all belong to Bowanee," answered the Malay."What is there yet to
do?--I am ready."Whilst he thus spoke, his face was turned towards the
door of the hut; on a sudden, he said in a low voice: "Here is Djalma."He must not see me yet," said Faringhea, retiring to an obscure corner
of the cabin, and hiding himself under a mat; "try to persuade him.If he
resists--I have my project."Hardly had Faringhea disappeared, saying these words, when Djalma arrived
at the door of the hovel.At sight of those three personages with their
forbidding aspect, Djalma started in surprise.But ignorant that these
men belonged to the Phansegars, and knowing that, in a country where
there are no inns, travellers often pass the night under a tent, or
beneath the shelter of some ruins, he continued to advance towards them.After the first moment, he perceived by the complexion and the dress of
one of these men, that he was an Indian, and he accosted him in the
Hindoo language: "I thought to have found here a European--a Frenchman--"

"The Frenchman is not yet come," replied the Indian; "but he will not be
long."Guessing by Djalma's question the means which Mahal had employed to draw
him into the snare, the Indian hoped to gain time by prolonging his
error.asked Djalma of the Phansegar."He appointed us to meet here, as he did you," answered the Indian.inquired Djalma, more and more astonished."General Simon told you to be at this place?""Yes, General Simon," replied the Indian.There was a moment's pause, during which Djalma sought in vain to explain
to himself this mysterious adventure.asked he, with a
look of suspicion; for the gloomy silence of the Phansegar's two
companions, who stared fixedly at each other, began to give him some
uneasiness."We are yours, if you will be ours," answered the Indian."I have no need of you--nor you of me."The English killed your father, a king; made you a
captive; proscribed you, you have lost all your possessions."At this cruel reminder, the countenance of Djalma darkened.He started,
and a bitter smile curled his lip.The Phansegar continued:

"Your father was just and brave--beloved by his subjects--they called him
'Father of the Generous,' and he was well named.Will you leave his death
unavenged?Will the hate, which gnaws at your heart, be without fruit?""My father died with arms in his hand.I revenged his death on the
English whom I killed in war.He, who has since been a father to me, and
who fought also in the same cause, told me, that it would now be madness
to attempt to recover my territory from the English.When they gave me my
liberty, I swore never again to set foot in India--and I keep the oaths I
make.""Those who despoiled you, who took you captive, who killed your
father--were men.Are there not other men, on whom you can avenge
yourself!"You, who speak thus of men, are not a man!""I, and those who resemble me, are more than men.We are, to the rest of
the human race, what the bold hunter is to the wild beasts, which they
run down in the forest.Will you be, like us, more than a man?Will you
glut surely, largely, safely--the hate which devours your heart, for all
the evil done you?""Your words become more and more obscure: I have no hatred in my heart,"
said Djalma."When an enemy is worthy of me, I fight with him; when he is
unworthy, I despise him.So that I have no hate--either for brave men or
cowards."cried the <DW64> on a sudden, pointing with rapid gesture to
the door, for Djalma and the Indian had now withdrawn a little from it,
and were standing in one corner of the hovel.At the shout of the <DW64>, Faringhea, who had not been perceived by
Djalma, threw off abruptly the mat which covered him, drew his crease,
started up like a tiger, and with one bound was out of the cabin.Then,
seeing a body of soldiers advancing cautiously in a circle, he dealt one
of them a mortal stroke, threw down two others, and disappeared in the
midst of the ruins.All this passed so instantaneously, that, when Djalma
turned round, to ascertain the cause of the <DW64>'s cry of alarm,
Faringhea had already disappeared.The muskets of several soldiers, crowding to the door, were immediately
pointed at Djalma and the three Stranglers, whilst others went in pursuit
of Faringhea.The <DW64>, the Malay, and the Indian, seeing the
impossibility of resistance, exchanged a few rapid words, and offered
their hands to the cords, with which some of the soldiers had provided
themselves.The Dutch captain, who commanded the squad, entered the cabin at this
moment.said he, pointing out Djalma to the
soldiers, who were occupied in binding the three Phansegars.Djalma had remained petrified with surprise, not understanding what was
passing round him; but, when he saw the sergeant and two soldiers
approach with ropes to bind him, he repulsed them with violent
indignation, and rushed towards the door where stood the officer.The
soldiers, who had supposed that Djalma would submit to his fate with the
same impassibility as his companions, were astounded by this resistance,
and recoiled some paces, being struck in spite of themselves, with the
noble and dignified air of the son of Kadja-sing."Why would you bind me like these men?"cried Djalma, addressing himself
in Hindostanee to the officer, who understood that language from his long
service in the Dutch colonies."Why would we bind you, wretch?--because you form part of this band of
assassins.added the officer in Dutch, speaking to the soldiers,
"are you afraid of him?--Tie the cord tight about his wrists; there will
soon be another about his neck.""You are mistaken," said Djalma, with a dignity and calmness which
astonished the officer; "I have hardly been in this place a quarter of an
hour--I do not know these men."Not a Phansegar like them?--Who will believe the falsehood?"cried Djalma, with so natural a movement and expression of
horror, that with a sign the officer stopped the soldiers, who were again
advancing to bind the son of Kadja-sing; "these men form part of that
horrible band of murderers!and you accuse me of being their
accomplice!--Oh, in this case, sir!I am perfectly at ease," said the
young man, with a smile of disdain."It will not be sufficient to say that you are tranquil," replied the
officer; "thanks to their confessions, we now know by what mysterious
signs to recognize the Thugs.""I repeat, sir, that I hold these murderers in the greatest horror, and
that I came here--"

The <DW64>, interrupting Djalma, said to the officer with a ferocious joy:
"You have hit it; the sons of the good work do know each other by marks
tattooed on their skin.For us, the hour has come--we give our necks to
the cord.Often enough have we twined it round the necks of those who
served not with us the good work.Now, look at our arms, and look at the
arms of this youth!"The officer, misinterpreting the words of the <DW64>, said to Djalma: "It
is quite clear, that if, as this <DW64> tells us, you do not bear on your
arm the mysterious symbol--(we are going to assure ourselves of the
fact), and if you can explain your presence here in a satisfactory
manner, you may be at liberty within two hours.""You do not understand me," said the <DW64> to the officer; "Prince Djalma
is one of us, for he bears on his left arm the name of Bowanee."he is like us, a son of Kale!""He is like us, a Phansegar," said the Indian.The three men, irritated at the horror which Djalma had manifested on
learning that they were Phansegars, took a savage pride in making it
believed that the son of Kadja-sing belonged to their frightful
association.The latter again
gave a look of disdainful pity, raised with his right hand his long, wide
left sleeve, and displayed his naked arm.cried the officer, for on the inner part of the fore
arm, a little below the bend, the name of the Bowanee, in bright red
Hindoo characters, was distinctly visible.The officer ran to the Malay,
and uncovered his arm; he saw the same word, the same signs.Not yet
satisfied, he assured himself that the <DW64> and the Indian were likewise
so marked.cried he, turning furiously towards Djalma; "you inspire even
more horror than your accomplices.Bind him like a cowardly assassin,"
added he to the soldiers; "like a cowardly assassin, who lies upon the
brink of the grave, for his execution will not be long delayed."Struck with stupor, Djalma, who for some moments had kept his eye riveted
on the fatal mark, was unable to pronounce a word, or make the least
movement: his powers of thought seemed to fail him, in presence of this
incomprehensible fact.said the officer to him, with
indignation."I cannot deny what I see--what is," said Djalma, quite overcome."It is lucky that you confess at last," replied the officer."Soldiers,
keep watch over him and his accomplices--you answer for them."Almost believing himself the sport of some wild dream.Djalma offered no
resistance, but allowed himself to be bound and removed with mechanical
passiveness.The officer, with part of his soldiers, hoped still to
discover Faringhea amongst the ruins; but his search was vain, and, after
spending an hour in fruitless endeavors, he set out for Batavia, where
the escort of the prisoners had arrived before him.Some hours after these events, M. Joshua van Dael thus finished his long
despatch, addressed to M. Rodin, of Paris:

"Circumstances were such, that I could not act otherwise; and, taking all
into consideration, it is a very small evil for a great good.Three
murderers are delivered over to justice, and the temporary arrest of
Djalma will only serve to make his innocence shine forth with redoubled
luster."Already this morning I went to the governor, to protest in favor of our
young prince.'As it was through me,' I said, 'that those three great
criminals fell into the hands of the authorities, let them at least show
me some gratitude, by doing everything to render clear as day the
innocence of Prince Djalma, so interesting by reason of his misfortunes
and noble qualities.Most certainly,' I added, 'when I came yesterday to
inform the governor, that the Phansegars would be found assembled in the
ruins of Tchandi, I was far from anticipating that any one would confound
with those wretches the adopted son of General Simon, an excellent man,
with whom I have had for some time the most honorable relations.We must,
then, at any cost, discover the inconceivable mystery that has placed
Djalma in this dangerous position;' and, I continued,'so convinced am I
of his innocence, that, for his own sake, I would not ask for any favor
on his behalf.He will have sufficient courage and dignity to wait
patiently in prison for the day of justice.'In all this, you see, I
spoke nothing but the truth, and had not to reproach myself with the
least deception, for nobody in the world is more convinced than I am of
Djalma's innocence."The governor answered me as I expected, that morally he felt as certain
as I did of the innocence of the young prince, and would treat him with
all possible consideration; but that it was necessary for justice to have
its course, because it would be the only way of demonstrating the
falsehood of the accusation, and discovering by what unaccountable
fatality that mysterious sign was tattooed upon Djalma's arm."Mahal the Smuggler, who alone could enlighten justice on this subject,
will in another hour have quitted Batavia, to go on board the 'Ruyter,'
which will take him to Egypt; for he has a note from me to the captain,
to certify that he is the person for whom I engaged and paid the passage.At the same time, he will be the bearer of this long despatch, for the
'Ruyter' is to sail in an hour, and the last letter-bag for Europe was
made up yesterday evening.But I wished to see the governor this morning,
before closing the present."Thus, then, is Prince Djalma enforced detained for a month, and, this
opportunity of the 'Ruyter' once lost, it is materially impossible that
the young Indian can be in France by the 13th of next February.You see,
therefore, that, even as you ordered, so have I acted according to the
means at my disposal--considering only the end which justifies them--for
you tell me a great interest of the society is concerned."In your hands, I have been what we all ought to be in the hands of our
superiors--a mere instrument: since, for the greater glory of God, we
become corpses with regard to the will.[7] Men may deny our unity and
power, and the times appear opposed to us; but circumstances only change;
we are ever the same."Obedience and courage, secrecy and patience, craft and audacity, union
and devotion--these become us, who have the world for our country, our
brethren for family, Rome for our Queen!About ten o'clock in the morning, Mahal the Smuggler set out with this
despatch (sealed) in his possession, to board the "Ruyter."An hour
later, the dead body of this same Mahal, strangled by Thuggee, lay
concealed beneath some reeds on the edge of a desert strand, whither he
had gone to take boat to join the vessel.When at a subsequent period, after the departure of the steamship, they
found the corpse of the smuggler, M. Joshua sought in vain for the
voluminous packet, which he had entrusted to his care.Neither was there
any trace of the note which Mahal was to have delivered to the captain of
the "Ruyter," in order to be received as passenger.Finally, the searches and bushwhacking ordered throughout the country for
the purpose of discovering Faringhea, were of no avail.The dangerous
chief of the Stranglers was never seen again in Java.[7] It is known that the doctrine of passive and absolute obedience, the
main-spring of the Society of Jesus, is summed up in those terrible words
of the dying Loyola: "Every member of the Order shall be, in the hands of
his superiors, even as a corpse (Perinde ac Cadaver)."--E.Three months have elapsed since Djalma was thrown into Batavia Prison
accused of belonging to the murderous gang of Megpunnas.The following
scene takes place in France, at the commencement of the month of
February, 1832, in Cardoville Manor House, an old feudal habitation
standing upon the tall cliffs of Picardy, not far from Saint Valery, a
dangerous coast on which almost every year many ships are totally
wrecked, being driven on shore by the northwesters, which render the
navigation of the Channel so perilous.From the interior of the Castle is heard the howling of a violent
tempest, which has arisen during the night; a frequent formidable noise,
like the discharge of artillery, thunders in the distance, and is
repeated by the echoes of the shore; it is the sea breaking with fury
against the high rocks which are overlooked by the ancient Manor House.It is about seven o'clock in the morning.Daylight is not yet visible
through the windows of a large room situated on the ground-floor.In this
apartment, in which a lamp is burning, a woman of about sixty years of
age, with a simple and honest countenance, dressed as a rich farmer's
wife of Picardy, is already occupied with her needle-work,
notwithstanding the early hour.Close by, the husband of this woman,
about the same age as herself, is seated at a large table, sorting and
putting up in bags divers samples of wheat and oats.The face of this
white-haired man is intelligent and open, announcing good sense and
honesty, enlivened by a touch of rustic humor; he wears a shooting-jacket
of green cloth, and long gaiters of tan- leather, which half
conceal his black velveteen breeches.The terrible storm which rages without renders still more agreeable the
picture of this peaceful interior.A rousing fire burns in a broad
chimney-place faced with white marble, and throws its joyous light on the
carefully polished floor; nothing can be more cheerful than the old
fashioned chintz hangings and curtains with red Chinese figures upon a
white ground, and the panels over the door painted with pastoral scenes
in the style of Watteau.A clock of Sevres china, and rosewood furniture
inlaid with green--quaint and portly furniture, twisted into all sorts of
grotesque shapes--complete the decorations of this apartment.Out-doors, the gale continued to howl furiously, and sometimes a gust of
wind would rush down the chimney, or shake the fastenings of the windows.The man who was occupied in sorting the samples of grain was M. Dupont,
bailiff of Cardoville manor.said his wife; "what dreadful weather, my dear!This M.
Rodin, who is to come here this morning, as the Princess de Saint
Dizier's steward announced to us, picked out a very bad day for it.""Why, in truth, I have rarely heard such a hurricane.If M. Rodin has
never seen the sea in its fury, he may feast his eyes to-day with the
sight.""What can it be that brings this M. Rodin, my dear?"The steward tells me in his letter to
show M. Rodin the greatest attention, and to obey him as if he were my
master.It will be for him to explain himself, and for me to execute his
orders, since he comes on the part of the princess.""By rights he should come from Mademoiselle Adrienne, as the land belongs
to her since the death of the duke her father.""Yes; but the princess being aunt to the young lady, her steward manages
Mademoiselle Adrienne's affairs--so whether one or the other, it amounts
to the same thing.""May be M. Rodin means to buy the estate.Though, to be sure, that stout
lady who came from Paris last week on purpose to see the chateau appeared
to have a great wish for it."At these words the bailiff began to laugh with a sly look."What is there to laugh at, Dupont?"asked his wife, a very good
creature, but not famous for intelligence or penetration."I laugh," answered Dupont, "to think of the face and figure of that
enormous woman: with such a look, who the devil would call themselves
Madame de la Sainte-Colombe--Mrs.A pretty saint, and a pretty
dove, truly!She is round as a hogshead, with the voice of a town-crier;
has gray moustachios like an old grenadier, and without her knowing it, I
heard her say to her servant: 'Stir your stumps, my hearty!'--and yet she
calls herself Sainte-Colombe!""How hard on her you are, Dupont; a body don't choose one's name.And, if
she has a beard, it is not the lady's fault.""No--but it is her fault to call herself Sainte-Colombe.Ah, my poor Catherine, you are yet very green in some
things.""While you, my poor Dupont, are well read in slander!The first thing she asked for on arriving was the
chapel of the Castle, of which she had heard speak.She even said that
she would make some embellishments in it; and, when I told her we had no
church in this little place, she appeared quite vexed not to have a
curate in the village."that's the first thought of your upstarts--to play the
great lady of the parish, like your titled people.""Madame de la Sainte-Colombe need not play the great lady, because she is
one.""Yes--only see how she was dressed, in scarlet gown, and violet gloves
like a bishop's; and, when she took off her bonnet, she had a diamond
band round her head-dress of false, light hair, and diamond ear-drops as
large as my thumb, and diamond rings on every finger!None of your
tuppenny beauties would wear so many diamonds in the middle of the day.""Do you mean to say there's more?""She talked of nothing but dukes, and marquises, and counts, and very
rich gentlemen, who visit at her house, and are her most intimate
friends; and then, when she saw the summer house in the park, half-burnt
by the Prussians, which our late master never rebuilt, she asked, 'What
are those ruins there?'and I answered: 'Madame, it was in the time of
the Allies that the pavilion was burnt.'--'Oh, my clear,' cried she; 'our
allies, good, dear allies!So
you see, Dupont, I said to myself directly: 'She was no doubt one of the
noble women who fled abroad--'"

"Madame de la Sainte-Colombe!"cried the bailiff, laughing heartily."Oh,
my poor, poor wife!""Oh, it is all very well; but because you have been three years at Paris,
don't think yourself a conjurer!""Catherine, let's drop it: you will make me say some folly, and there are
certain things which dear, good creatures like you need never know.""I cannot tell what you are driving at, only try to be less
slanderous--for, after all, should Madame de la Sainte-Colombe buy the
estate, will you be sorry to remain as her bailiff, eh?""Not I--for we are getting old, my good Catherine; we have lived here
twenty years, and we have been too honest to provide for our old days by
pilfering--and truly, at our age, it would be hard to seek another place,
which perhaps we should not find.What I regret is, that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should not keep the land; it seems that she wished to sell it,
against the will of the princess."is it not very extraordinary that Mademoiselle
Adrienne should have the disposal of her large fortune so early in life?"Our young lady, having no father or mother, is
mistress of her property, besides having a famous little will of her own.Dost remember, ten years ago, when the count brought her down here one
summer?--what an imp of mischief!eh?--how they
sparkled, even then!""It is true that Mademoiselle Adrienne had in her look--an expression--a
very uncommon expression for her age.""If she has kept what her witching, luring face promised, she must be
very pretty by this time, notwithstanding the peculiar color of her
hair--for, between ourselves, if she had been a tradesman's daughter,
instead of a young lady of high birth, they would have called it red."Heaven forbid--I always thought
that she would be as good as pretty, and it is not speaking ill of her to
say she has red hair.On the contrary, it always appears to me so fine,
so bright, so sunny, and to suit so well her snowy complexion and black
eyes, that in truth I would not have had it other than it was; and I am
sure, that now this very color of her hair, which would be a blemish in
any one else, must only add to the charm of Mademoiselle Adrienne's face.She must have such a sweet vixen look!"to be candid, she really was a vixen--always running about the park,
aggravating her governess, climbing the trees--in fact, playing all
manner of naughty tricks.""I grant you, Mademoiselle Adrienne was a chip of the old block; but then
what wit, what engaging ways, and above all, what a good heart!"Once I remember she gave her shawl and her
new merino frock to a poor little beggar girl, and came back to the house
in her petticoat, and bare arms.""Oh, an excellent heart--but headstrong--terribly headstrong!""Yes--that she was; and 'tis likely to finish badly, for it seems that
she does things at Paris--oh!such things--"

"What things?""Oh, my dear; I can hardly venture--"

"Fell, but what are they?""Why," said the worthy dame, with a sort of embarrassment and confusion,
which showed how much she was shocked by such enormities, "they say, that
Mademoiselle Adrienne never sets foot in a church, but lives in a kind of
heathen temple in her aunt's garden, where she has masked women to dress
her up like a goddess, and scratches them very often, because she gets
tipsy--without mentioning, that every night she plays on a hunting horn
of massive gold--all which causes the utmost grief and despair to her
poor aunt the princess."Here the bailiff burst into a fit of laughter, which interrupted his
wife."Now tell me," said he, when this first access of hilarity was over,
"where did you get these fine stories about Mademoiselle Adrienne?""From Rene's wife, who went to Paris to look for a child to nurse; she
called at Saint-Dizier House, to see Madame Grivois, her godmother.--Now
Madame Grivois is first bedchamber woman to the princess--and she it was
who told her all this--and surely she ought to know, being in the house.""Yes, a fine piece of goods that Grivois!once she was a regular bad 'un,
but now she professes to be as over-nice as her mistress; like master
like man, they say.The princess herself, who is now so stiff and
starched, knew how to carry on a lively game in her time.Fifteen years
ago, she was no such prude: do you remember that handsome colonel of
hussars, who was in garrison at Abbeville?an exiled noble who had served
in Russia, whom the Bourbons gave a regiment on the Restoration?""Yes, yes--I remember him; but you are really too backbiting.""Not a bit--I only speak the truth.The colonel spent his whole time
here, and every one said he was very warm with this same princess, who is
now such a saint.Every evening, some new
entertainment at the chateau.What a fellow that colonel was, to set
things going; how well he could act a play!--I remember--"

The bailiff was unable to proceed.A stout maid-servant, wearing the
costume and cap of Picardy, entered in haste, and thus addressed her
mistress: "Madame, there is a person here that wants to speak to master;
he has come in the postmaster's calash from Saint-Valery, and he says
that he is M.A moment after, M. Rodin made his appearance.According to his custom, he
was dressed even more than plainly.With an air of great humility, he
saluted the bailiff and his wife, and at a sign from her husband, the
latter withdrew.The cadaverous countenance of M. Rodin, his almost
invisible lips, his little reptile eyes, half concealed by their flabby
lids, and the sordid style of his dress, rendered his general aspect far
from prepossessing; yet this man knew how, when it was necessary, to
affect, with diabolical art, so much sincerity and good-nature--his words
were so affectionate and subtly penetrating--that the disagreeable
feeling of repugnance, which the first sight of him generally inspired,
wore off little by little, and he almost always finished by involving his
dupe or victim in the tortuous windings of an eloquence as pliant as it
was honeyed and perfidious; for ugliness and evil have their fascination,
as well as what is good and fair.The honest bailiff looked at this man with surprise, when he thought of
the pressing recommendation of the steward of the Princess de Saint
Dizier; he had expected to see quite another sort of personage, and,
hardly able to dissemble his astonishment, he said to him: "Is it to M.
Rodin that I have the honor to speak?""Yes, sir; and here is another letter from the steward of the Princess de
Saint-Dizier.""Pray, sir, draw near the fire, whilst I just see what is in this letter.The weather is so bad," continued the bailiff, obligingly, "may I not
offer you some refreshment?""A thousand thanks, my dear sir; I am off again in an hour."Whilst M. Dupont read, M. Rodin threw inquisitive glances round the
chamber; like a man of skill and experience, he had frequently drawn just
and useful inductions from those little appearances, which, revealing a
taste or habit, give at the same time some notion of a character; on this
occasion, however, his curiosity was at fault."Very good, sir," said the bailiff, when he had finished reading; "the
steward renews his recommendation, and tells me to attend implicitly to
your commands.""Well, sir, they will amount to very little, and I shall not trouble you
long.""It will be no trouble, but an honor.""Nay, I know how much your time must be occupied, for, as soon as one
enters this chateau, one is struck with the good order and perfect
keeping of everything in it--which proves, my dear sir, what excellent
care you take of it.""Oh, sir, you flatter me.""Flatter you?--a poor old man like myself has something else to think of.But to come to business: there is a room here which is called the Green
Chamber?""Yes, sir; the room which the late Count-Duke de Cardoville used for a
study.""You will have the goodness to take me there.""Unfortunately, it is not in my power to do so.After the death of the
Count-Duke, and when the seals were removed, a number of papers were shut
up in a cabinet in that room, and the lawyers took the keys with them to
Paris.""Here are those keys," said M. Rodin, showing to the bailiff a large and
a small key tied together."Yes--for certain papers--and also far a small mahogany casket, with
silver clasps--do you happen to know it?""Yes, sir; I have often seen it on the count's writing-table.It must be
in the large, lacquered cabinet, of which you have the key.""You will conduct me to this chamber, as authorized by the Princess de
Saint-Dizier?""Yes, sir; the princess continues in good health?""And Mademoiselle Adrienne?"said M. Rodin, with a sigh of deep contrition and
grief.has any calamity happened to Mademoiselle Adrienne?""No, no--she is, unfortunately, as well as she is beautiful."for when beauty, youth, and health are joined to an evil
spirit of revolt and perversity--to a character which certainly has not
its equal upon earth--it would be far better to be deprived of those
dangerous advantages, which only become so many causes of perdition.But
I conjure you, my dear sir, let us talk of something else: this subject
is too painful," said M. Rodin, with a voice of deep emotion, lifting the
tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as if to stop a
rising tear.The bailiff did not see the tear, but he saw the gesture, and he was
struck with the change in M. Rodin's voice.He answered him, therefore,
with much sympathy: "Pardon my indiscretion, sir; I really did not
know--"

"It is I who should ask pardon for this involuntary display of
feeling--tears are so rare with old men--but if you had seen, as I have,
the despair of that excellent princess, whose only fault has been too
much kindness, too much weakness, with regard to her niece--by which she
has encouraged her--but, once more, let us talk of something else, my
dear sir!"After a moment's pause, during which M. Rodin seemed to recover from his
emotion, he said to Dupont: "One part of my mission, my dear sir--that
which relates to the Green Chamber--I have now told you; but there is yet
another.Before coming to it, however, I must remind you of a
circumstance you have perhaps forgotten--namely, that some fifteen or
sixteen years ago, the Marquis d'Aigrigny, then colonel of the hussars in
garrison at Abbeville, spent some time in this house."It was only just now, that I
was talking about him to my wife.He was the life of the house!--how well
he could perform plays--particularly the character of a scapegrace.In
the Two Edmonds, for instance, he would make you die with laughing, in
that part of a drunken soldier--and then, with what a charming voice he
sang Joconde, sir--better than they could sing it at Paris!"Rodin, having listened complacently to the bailiff, said to him: "You
doubtless know that, after a fierce duel he had with a furious
Bonapartist, one General Simon, the Marquis d'Aigrigny (whose private
secretary I have now the honor to be) left the world for the church.""That fine officer--brave, noble, rich, esteemed, and
flattered--abandoned all those advantages for the sorry black gown; and,
notwithstanding his name, position, high connections, his reputation as a
great preacher, he is still what he was fourteen years ago--a plain
abbe--whilst so many, who have neither his merit nor his virtues, are
archbishops and cardinals."M. Rodin expressed himself with so much goodness, with such an air of
conviction, and the facts he cited appeared to be so incontestable, that
M. Dupont could not help exclaiming: "Well, sir, that is splendid
conduct!"said M. Rodin, with an inimitable expression of
simplicity; "it is quite a matter of course when one has a heart like M.
d'Aigrigny's.But amongst all his good qualities, he has particularly
that of never forgetting worthy people--people of integrity, honor,
conscience--and therefore, my dear M. Dupont, he has not forgotten you.""What, the most noble marquis deigns to remember--"

"Three days ago, I received a letter from him, in which he mentions your
name.""He will be there soon, if not there now.He went to Italy about three
months ago, and, during his absence, he received a very sad piece of
news--the death of his mother, who was passing the autumn on one of the
estates of the Princess de Saint-Dizier.""Yes, it was a cruel grief to him; but we must all resign ourselves to
the will of Providence!""And with regard to what subject did the marquis do me the honor to
mention my name?"First of all, you must know that this house is
sold.The bill of sale was signed the day before my departure from
Paris.""I am afraid that the new proprietors may not choose to keep me as their
bailiff."It is just on that subject that I am going
to speak to you."Knowing the interest which the marquis feels for you, I am
particularly desirous that you should keep this place, and I will do all
in my power to serve you, if--"

"Ah, sir!"cried Dupont, interrupting Rodin; "what gratitude do I not owe
you!"Now, my dear sir, you flatter me in your turn; but I ought to tell you,
that I'm obliged to annex a small condition to my support.""The person who is about to inhabit this mansion, is an old lady in every
way worthy of veneration; Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is the name of this
respectable--"

"What, sir?"said the bailiff, interrupting Rodin; "Madame de la Sainte
Colombe the lady who has bought us out?""Yes, sir, she came last week to see the estate.My wife persists that
she is a great lady; but--between ourselves--judging by certain words
that I heard her speak--"

"You are full of penetration, my dear M. Dupont.Madame de la Sainte
Colombe is far from being a great lady.I believe she was neither more
nor less than a milliner, under one of the wooden porticoes of the Palais
Royal.You see, that I deal openly with you.""And she boasted of all the noblemen, French and foreign, who used to
visit her!""No doubt, they came to buy bonnets for their wives!However, the fact
is, that, having gained a large fortune and, after being in youth and
middle age--indifferent--alas!more than indifferent to the salvation of
her soul--Madame de la Sainte-Colombe is now in a likely way to
experience grace--which renders her, as I told you, worthy of veneration,
because nothing is so respectable as a sincere repentance--always
providing it to be lasting.Now to make the good work sure and effectual,
we shall need your assistance, my dear M."A great deal; and I will explain to you how.There is no church in this
village, which stands at an equal distance from either of two parishes.Madame de la Sainte-Colombe, wishing to make choice of one of the two
clergymen, will naturally apply to you and Madame Dupont, who have long
lived in these parts, for information respecting them."in that case the choice will soon be made.The incumbent of
Danicourt is one of the best of men.""Now that is precisely what you must not say to Madame de la Sainte
Colombe.""You must, on the contrary, much praise, without ceasing, the curate of
Roiville, the other parish, so as to decide this good lady to trust
herself to his care.""And why, sir, to him rather than to the other?""Why?--because, if you and Madame Dupont succeed in persuading Madame de
la Sainte-Colombe to make the choice I wish, you will be certain to keep
your place as bailiff.I give you my word of it, and what I promise I
perform.""I do not doubt, sir, that you have this power," said Dupont, convinced
by Rodin's manner, and the authority of his words; "but I should like to
know--"

"One word more," said Rodin, interrupting him; "I will deal openly with
you, and tell you why I insist on the preference which I beg you to
support.I should be grieved if you saw in all this the shadow of an
intrigue.It is only for the purpose of doing a good action.The curate
of Roiville, for whom I ask your influence, is a man for whom M.
d'Aigrigny feels a deep interest.Though very poor, he has to support an
aged mother.Now, if he had the spiritual care of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe, he would do more good than any one else, because he is full of
zeal and patience; and then it is clear he would reap some little
advantages, by which his old mother might profit--there you see is the
secret of this mighty scheme.When I knew that this lady was disposed to
buy an estate in the neighborhood of our friend's parish, I wrote about
it to the marquis; and he, remembering you, desired me to ask you to
render him this small service, which, as you see, will not remain without
a recompense.For I tell you once more, and I will prove it, that I have
the power to keep you in your place as bailiff.""Well, sir," replied Dupont, after a moment's reflection, "you are so
frank and obliging, that I will imitate your sincerity.In the same
degree that the curate of Danicourt is respected and loved in this
country, the curate of Roiville, whom you wish me to prefer to him, is
dreaded for his intolerance--and, moreover--"

"Well, and what more?""Why, then, they say--"

"Come, what do they say?"Upon these words, M. Rodin burst into so hearty a laugh that the bailiff
was quite struck dumb with amazement--for the countenance of M. Rodin
took a singular expression when he laughed.he repeated, with
redoubled hilarity; "a Jesuit!--Now really, my dear M. Dupont, for a man
of sense, experience, and intelligence, how can you believe such idle
stories?--A Jesuit--are there such people as Jesuits?--in our time, above
all, can you believe such romance of the Jacobins, hobgoblins of the old
freedom lovers?--Come, come; I wager, you have read about them in the
Constitutionnel!""And yet, sir, they say--"

"Good heavens!what will they not say?--But wise men, prudent men like
you, do not meddle with what is said--they manage their own little
matters, without doing injury to any one, and they never sacrifice, for
the sake of nonsense, a good place, which secures them a comfortable
provision for the rest of their days.I tell you frankly, however much I
may regret it, that should you not succeed in getting the preference for
my man, you will not remain bailiff here."But, sir," said poor Dupont, "it will not be my fault, if this lady,
hearing a great deal in praise of the other curate, should prefer him to
your friend."but if, on the other hand, persons who have long lived in the
neighborhood--persons worthy of confidence, whom she will see every
day--tell Madame de la Sainte-Colombe a great deal of good of my friend,
and a great deal of harm of the other curate, she will prefer the former,
and you will continue bailiff.""But, sir--that would be calumny!"said Rodin, with an air of sorrowful and
affectionate reproach, "how can you think me capable of giving you evil
counsel?--I was only making a supposition.You wish to remain bailiff on
this estate.I offer you the certainty of doing so--it is for you to
consider and decide.""But, sir--"

"One word more--or rather one more condition--as important as the other.Unfortunately, we have seen clergymen take advantage of the age and
weakness of their penitents, unfairly to benefit either themselves or
others: I believe our protege incapable of any such baseness--but, in
order to discharge my responsibility--and yours also, as you will have
contributed to his appointment--I must request that you will write to me
twice a week, giving the most exact detail of all that you have remarked
in the character, habits, connections, pursuits, of Madame de la Sainte
Colombe--for the influence of a confessor, you see, reveals itself in the
whole conduct of life, and I should wish to be fully edified by the
proceedings of my friend, without his being aware of it--or, if anything
blameable were to strike you, I should be immediately informed of it by
this weekly correspondence.""But, sir--that would be to act as a spy?""Now, my dear M. Dupont!how can you thus brand the sweetest, most
wholesome of human desires--mutual confidence?--I ask of you nothing
else--I ask of you to write to me confidentially the details of all that
goes on here.On these two conditions, inseparable one from the other,
you remain bailiff; otherwise, I shall be forced, with grief and regret,
to recommend some one else to Madame de la Sainte-Colombe.""I beg you, sir," said Dupont, with emotion, "Be generous without any
conditions!--I and my wife have only this place to give us bread, and we
are too old to find another.Do not expose our probity of forty years'
standing to be tempted by the fear of want, which is so bad a
counsellor!""My dear M. Dupont, you are really a great child: you must reflect upon
this, and give me your answer in the course of a week."I implore you--" The conversation was here interrupted by a
loud report, which was almost instantaneously repeated by the echoes of
the cliffs.Hardly had he spoken, when the
same noise was again heard more distinctly than before."It is the sound of cannon," cried Dupont, rising; "no doubt a ship in
distress, or signaling for a pilot.""My dear," said the bailiffs wife, entering abruptly, "from the terrace,
we can see a steamer and a large ship nearly dismasted--they are drifting
right upon the shore--the ship is firing minute gulls--it will be lost."cried the bailiff, taking his hat and preparing to
go out, "to look on at a shipwreck, and be able to do nothing!""Can no help be given to these vessels?""If they are driven upon the reefs, no human power can save them; since
the last equinox two ships have been lost on this coast.""Lost with all on board?--Oh, very frightful," said M. Rodin."In such a storm, there is but little chance for the crew; no matter,"
said the bailiff, addressing his wife, "I will run down to the rocks with
the people of the farm, and try to save some of them, poor
creatures!--Light large fires in several rooms--get ready linen, clothes,
cordials--I scarcely dare hope to save any, but we must do our best."I should think it a duty, if I could be at all useful, but I am too old
and feeble to be of any service," said M. Rodin, who was by no means
anxious to encounter the storm."Your good lady will be kind enough to
show me the Green Chamber, and when I have found the articles I require,
I will set out immediately for Paris, for I am in great haste."Ring the big bell," said the
bailiff to his servant; "let all the people of the farm meet me at the
foot of the cliff, with ropes and levers.""Yes, my dear," replied Catherine; "but do not expose yourself.""Kiss me--it will bring me luck," said the bailiff; and he started at a
full run, crying: "Quick!quick; by this time not a plank may remain of
the vessels.""My dear madam," said Rodin, always impassible, "will you be obliging
enough to show me the Green Chamber?""Please to follow me, sir," answered Catherine, drying her tears--for she
trembled on account of her husband, whose courage she well knew.THE TEMPEST

The sea is raging.Mountainous waves of dark green, marbled with white
foam, stand out, in high, deep undulations, from the broad streak of red
light, which extends along the horizon.Above are piled heavy masses of
black and sulphurous vapor, whilst a few lighter clouds of a reddish
gray, driven by the violence of the wind, rush across the murky sky.The pale winter sun, before he quite disappears in the great clouds,
behind which he is slowly mounting, casts here and there some oblique
rays upon the troubled sea, and gilds the transparent crest of some of
the tallest waves.A band of snow-white foam boils and rages as far as
the eye can reach, along the line of the reefs that bristle on this
dangerous coast.Half-way up a rugged promontory, which juts pretty far into the sea,
rises Cardoville Castle; a ray of the sun glitters upon its windows; its
brick walls and pointed roofs of slate are visible in the midst of this
sky loaded with vapors.A large, disabled ship, with mere shreds of sail still fluttering from
the stumps of broken masts, drives dead upon the coast.Now she rolls her
monstrous hull upon the waves--now plunges into their trough.A flash is
seen, followed by a dull sound, scarcely perceptible in the midst of the
roar of the tempest.That gun is the last signal of distress from this
lost vessel, which is fast forging on the breakers.At the same moment, a steamer, with its long plume of black smoke, is
working her way from east to west, making every effort to keep at a
distance from the shore, leaving the breakers on her left.The dismasted
ship, drifting towards the rocks, at the mercy of the wind and tide, must
some time pass right ahead of the steamer.Suddenly, the rush of a heavy sea laid the steamer upon her side; the
enormous wave broke furiously on her deck; in a second the chimney was
carried away, the paddle box stove in, one of the wheels rendered
useless.A second white-cap, following the first, again struck the vessel
amidships, and so increased the damage that, no longer answering to the
helm, she also drifted towards the shore, in the same direction as the
ship.But the latter, though further from the breakers, presented a
greater surface to the wind and sea, and so gained upon the steamer in
swiftness that a collision between the two vessels became imminent--a new
clanger added to all the horrors of the now certain wreck.The ship was an English vessel, the "Black Eagle," homeward bound from
Alexandria, with passengers, who arriving from India and Java, via the
Red Sea, had disembarked at the Isthmus of Suez, from on board the
steamship "Ruyter."The "Black Eagle," quitting the Straits of Gibraltar,
had gone to touch at the Azores.She headed thence for Portsmouth, when
she was overtaken in the Channel by the northwester.The steamer was the
"William Tell," coming from Germany, by way of the Elbe, and bound, in
the last place, for Hamburg to Havre.These two vessels, the sport of enormous rollers, driven along by tide
and tempest, were now rushing upon the breakers with frightful speed.The
deck of each offered a terrible spectacle; the loss of crew and
passengers appeared almost certain, for before them a tremendous sea
broke on jagged rocks, at the foot of a perpendicular cliff.The captain of the "Black Eagle," standing on the poop, holding by the
remnant of a spar, issued his last orders in this fearful extremity with
courageous coolness.The smaller boats had been carried away by the
waves; it was in vain to think of launching the long-boat; the only
chance of escape in case the ship should not be immediately dashed to
pieces on touching the rocks, was to establish a communication with the
land by means of a life-line--almost the last resort for passing between
the shore and a stranded vessel.The deck was covered with passengers, whose cries and terror augmented
the general confusion.Some, struck with a kind of stupor, and clinging
convulsively to the shrouds, awaited their doom in a state of stupid
insensibility.Others wrung their hands in despair, or rolled upon the
deck uttering horrible imprecations.Here, women knelt down to pray;
there, others hid their faces in their hands, that they might not see the
awful approach of death.A young mother, pale as a specter, holding her
child clasped tightly to her bosom, went supplicating from sailor to
sailor, and offering a purse full of gold and jewels to any one that
would take charge of her son.These cries, and tears, and terror contrasted with the stern and silent
resignation of the sailors.Knowing the imminence of the inevitable
danger, some of them stripped themselves of part of their clothes,
waiting for the moment to make a last effort, to dispute their lives with
the fury of the waves; others renouncing all hope, prepared to meet death
with stoical indifference.Here and there, touching or awful episodes rose in relief, if one may so
express it, from this dark and gloomy background of despair.A young man of about eighteen or twenty, with shiny black hair, copper
<DW52> complexion, and perfectly regular and handsome features,
contemplated this scene of dismay and horror with that sad calmness
peculiar to those who have often braved great perils; wrapped in a cloak,
he leaned his back against the bulwarks, with his feet resting against
one of the bulkheads.Suddenly, the unhappy mother, who, with her child
in her arms, and gold in her hand, had in vain addressed herself to
several of the mariners, to beg them to save her boy, perceiving the
young man with the copper-<DW52> complexion, threw herself on her knees
before him, and lifted her child towards him with a burst of
inexpressible agony.The young man took it, mournfully shook his head,
and pointed to the furious waves--but, with a meaning gesture, he
appeared to promise that he would at least try to save it.Then the young
mother, in a mad transport of hope, seized the hand of the youth, and
bathed it with her tears.Further on, another passenger of the "Black Eagle," seemed animated by
sentiments of the most active pity.One would hardly have given him
five-and-twenty years of age.His long, fair locks fell in curls on
either side of his angelic countenance.He wore a black cassock and white
neck-band.Applying himself to comfort the most desponding, he went from
one to the other, and spoke to them pious words of hope and resignation;
to hear him console some, and encourage others, in language full of
unction, tenderness, and ineffable charity, one would have supposed him
unaware or indifferent to the perils that he shared.On his fine, mild features, was impressed a calm and sacred intrepidity,
a religious abstraction from every terrestrial thought; from time to
time, he raised to heaven his large blue eyes, beaming with gratitude,
love, and serenity, as if to thank God for having called him to one of
those formidable trials in which the man of humanity and courage may
devote himself for his brethren, and, if not able to rescue them at all,
at least die with them, pointing to the sky.One might almost have taken
him for an angel, sent down to render less cruel the strokes of
inexorable fate.not far from this young man's angelic beauty, there was
another being, who resembled an evil spirit!Boldly mounted on what was left of the bowsprit, to which he held on by
means of some remaining cordage, this man looked down upon the terrible
scene that was passing on the deck.A grim, wild joy lighted up his
countenance of a dead yellow, that tint peculiar to those who spring from
the union of the white race with the East.He wore only a shirt and linen
drawers; from his neck was suspended, by a cord, a cylindrical tin box,
similar to that in which soldiers carry their leave of absence.The more the danger augmented, the nearer the ship came to the breakers,
or to a collision with the steamer, which she was now rapidly
approaching--a terrible collision, which would probably cause the two
vessels to founder before even they touched the rocks--the more did the
infernal joy of this passenger reveal itself in frightful transports.He
seemed to long, with ferocious impatience, for the moment when the work
of destruction should be accomplished.To see him thus feasting with
avidity on all the agony, the terror, and the despair of those around
him, one might have taken him for the apostle of one of those sanguinary
deities, who, in barbarous countries, preside over murder and carnage.By this time the "Black Eagle," driven by the wind and waves, came so
near the "William Tell" that the passengers on the deck of the nearly
dismantled steamer were visible from the first-named vessel.The heavy sea, which stove in
the paddle-box and broke one of the paddles, had also carried away nearly
the whole of the bulwarks on that side; the waves, entering every instant
by this large opening, swept the decks with irresistible violence, and
every time bore away with them some fresh victims.Amongst the passengers, who seemed only to have escaped this danger to be
hurled against the rocks, or crushed in the encounter of the two vessels,
one group was especially worthy of the most tender and painful interest.Taking refuge abaft, a tall old man, with bald forehead and gray
moustache, had lashed himself to a stanchion, by winding a piece of rope
round his body, whilst he clasped in his arms, and held fast to his
breast, two girls of fifteen or sixteen, half enveloped in a pelisse of
reindeer-skin.A large, fallow, Siberian dog, dripping with water, and
barking furiously at the waves, stood close to their feet.These girls, clasped in the arms of the old man, also pressed close to
each other; but, far from being lost in terror, they raised their eyes to
heaven, full of confidence and ingenuous hope, as though they expected to
be saved by the intervention of some supernatural power.A frightful shriek of horror and despair, raised by the passengers of
both vessels, was heard suddenly above the roar of the tempest.At the
moment when, plunging deeply between two waves, the broadside of the
steamer was turned towards the bows of the ship, the latter, lifted to a
prodigious height on a mountain of water, remained, as it were, suspended
over the "William Tell," during the second which preceded the shock of
the two vessels.There are sights of so sublime a horror, that it is impossible to
describe them.Yet, in the midst of these catastrophes, swift as thought,
one catches sometimes a momentary glimpse of a picture, rapid and
fleeting, as if illumined by a flash of lightning.Thus, when the "Black Eagle," poised aloft by the flood, was about to
crash down upon the "William Tell," the young man with the angelic
countenance and fair, waving locks bent over the prow of the ship, ready
to cast himself into the sea to save some victim.Suddenly, he perceived
on board the steamer, on which he looked down from the summit of the
immense wave, the two girls extending their arms towards him in
supplication.They appeared to recognize him, and gazed on him with a
sort of ecstacy and religious homage!For a second, in spite of the horrors of the tempest, in spite of the
approaching shipwreck, the looks of those three beings met.The features
of the young man were expressive of sudden and profound pity; for the
maidens with their hands clasped in prayer, seemed to invoke him as their
expected Saviour.The old man, struck down by the fall of a plank, lay
helpless on the deck.A fearful mass of water dashed the "Black Eagle" down upon the "William
Tell," in the midst of a cloud of boiling foam.To the dreadful crash of
the two great bodies of wood and iron, which splintering against one
another, instantly foundered, one loud cry was added--a cry of agony and
death--the cry of a hundred human creatures swallowed up at once by the
waves!A few moments after, the fragments of the two vessels appeared in the
trough of the sea, and on the caps of the waves--with here and there the
contracted arms, the livid and despairing faces of some unhappy wretches,
striving to make their way to the reefs along the shore, at the risk of
being crushed to death by the shock of the furious breakers.While the bailiff was gone to the sea-shore, to render help to those of
the passengers who might escape from the inevitable shipwreck, M. Rodin,
conducted by Catherine to the Green Chamber, had there found the articles
that he was to take with him to Paris.After passing two hours in this apartment, very indifferent to the fate
of the shipwrecked persons, which alone absorbed the attention of the
inhabitants of the Castle, Rodin returned to the chamber commonly
occupied by the bailiff, a room which opened upon a long gallery.When he
entered it he found nobody there.Under his arm he held a casket, with
silver fastenings, almost black from age, whilst one end of a large red
morocco portfolio projected from the breast-pocket of his half buttoned
great coat.Had the cold and livid countenance of the Abbe d'Aigrigny's secretary
been able to express joy otherwise than by a sarcastic smile, his
features would have been radiant with delight; for, just then, he was
under the influence of the most agreeable thoughts.Having placed the
casket upon a table, it was with marked satisfaction that he thus
communed with himself:

"All goes well.It was prudent to keep these papers here till this
moment, for one must always be on guard against the diabolical spirit of
that Adrienne de Cardoville, who appears to guess instinctively what it
is impossible she should know.Fortunately, the time approaches when we
shall have no more need to fear her.Her fate will be a cruel one; it
must be so.Those proud, independent characters are at all times our
natural enemies--they are so by their very essence--how much more when
they show themselves peculiarly hurtful and dangerous!As for La Sainte
Colombe, the bailiff is sure to act for us; between what the fool calls
his conscience, and the dread of being at his age deprived of a
livelihood, he will not hesitate.I wish to have him because he will
serve us better than a stranger; his having been here twenty years will
prevent all suspicion on the part of that dull and narrow-minded woman.Once in the hands of our man at Roiville, I will answer for the result.The course of all such gross and stupid women is traced beforehand: in
their youth, they serve the devil; in riper years, they make others serve
him; in their old age, they are horribly afraid of him; and this fear
must continue till she has left us the Chateau de Cardoville, which, from
its isolated position, will make us an excellent college.As for the affair of the medals, the 13th of February approaches,
without news from Joshua--evidently, Prince Djalma is still kept prisoner
by the English in the heart of India, or I must have received letters
from Batavia.The daughters of General Simon will be detained at Leipsic
for at least a month longer.All our foreign relations are in the best
condition.As for our internal affairs--"

 Here M. Rodin was interrupted in the current of his reflections by the
entrance of Madame Dupont, who was zealously engaged in preparations to
give assistance in case of need."Now," said she to the servant, "light a fire in the next room; put this
warm wine there; your master may be in every minute.""Well, my dear madam," said Rodin to her, "do they hope to save any of
these poor creatures?"He is so courageous, so imprudent, if
once he thinks he can be of any service.""Courageous even to imprudence," said Rodin to himself, impatiently; "I
do not like that.""Well," resumed Catherine, "I have here at hand my hot linen, my
cordials--heaven grant it may all be of use!""We may at least hope so, my dear madam.I very much regretted that my
age and weakness did not permit me to assist your excellent husband.I
also regret not being able to wait for the issue of his exertions, and to
wish him joy if successful--for I am unfortunately compelled to depart,
my moments are precious.I shall be much obliged if you will have the
carriage got ready.""Yes, Sir; I will see about it directly.""One word, my dear, good Madame Dupont.You are a woman of sense, and
excellent judgment.Now I have put your husband in the way to keep, if he
will, his situation as bailiff of the estate--"

"Is it possible?Without this place
what would become of us at our time of life?""I have only saddled my promise with two conditions--mere trifles--he
will explain all that to you."we shall regard you as our deliverer."Only, on two little conditions--"

"If there were a hundred, sir we should gladly accept them.Think what we
should be without this place--penniless--absolutely penniless!""I reckon upon you then; for the interest of your husband, you will try
to persuade him."here's master come back," cried a servant,
rushing into the chamber."No, missus; he is alone."A few moments after, M. Dupont entered the room; his clothes were
streaming with water; to keep his hat on in the midst of the storm, he
had tied it down to his head by means of his cravat, which was knotted
under his chin; his gaiters were covered with chalky stains."There I have thee, my dear love!"cried his wife, tenderly embracing
him."Up to the present moment--THREE SAVED."said Rodin; "at least your efforts
will not have been all in vain.""I only speak of those I saw myself, near the little creek of Goelands.Let us hope there may be more saved on other parts of the coast.""Yes, indeed; happily, the shore is not equally steep in all parts.""And where are these interesting sufferers, my dear sir?"asked Rodin,
who could not avoid remaining a few instants longer."They are mounting the cliffs, supported by our people.As they cannot
walk very fast, I ran on before to console my wife, and to take the
necessary measures for their reception.First of all, my dear, you must
get ready some women's clothes.""There is then a woman amongst the persons saved?""There are two girls--fifteen or sixteen years of age at the most--mere
children--and so pretty!"said Rodin, with an affectation of interest."The person to whom they owe their lives is with them."Yes; only fancy--"

"You can tell me all this by and by.Just slip on this dry warm
dressing-gown, and take some of this hot wine."I'll not refuse, for I am almost frozen to death.I was telling you that
the person who saved these young girls was a hero; and certainly his
courage was beyond anything one could have imagined.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."Sandra went back to the kitchen.said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.Pepper and many other
practitioners.It should be continued for two or three weeks at least,
but it may be given in small doses during several months, with
intermissions, without danger of silver staining.[48]

[Footnote 48: A case is recorded of silver staining of the skin after
four weeks' administration (Woodward, _op.A routine administration of any drug or class of drugs is
reprehensible, and from the numerous remedies which are advocated in
chronic diarrhoea selection can be made for trial in the course of
intractable cases.The list would include sulphate of copper
(one-fourth to one-half a grain), the liquid preparations of iron
(liquor ferri nitratis, tinct.ferri chloridi), dilute nitric and
sulphuric acids, gallic acid and other vegetable astringents, oxide or
sulphate of zinc, alum, precipitated phosphate of calcium, salicin,
corrosive sublimate (1/100 gr.every hour), the Indian bael-fruit, etc.No remedy should be abandoned until it has been continuously given for
one or more weeks.alum water is markedly astringent, is not
unpleasant, and may be used as a substitute for water with advantage.In fact, there is no better way of introducing in quantity a mild
astringent into the intestine than by the drinking of this water.Cold-water rectal irrigation has a sedative and astringent influence,
and when properly used is of great advantage to both children and
adults.[49] The patient should be placed in the proper position, and
the water made to enter the rectum as high up as possible.The number
of stools lessens almost immediately after this treatment, peristalsis
being inhibited thereby.[Footnote 49: A long rectal rubber tube, such as advised by
Surgeon-General Wales, U.S.N., serves this purpose well.]To the water used in irrigation astringents may be added in small
doses.Sulphate of zinc, sugar of lead, or alum may be given in this
way in the strength of one grain to four or six ounces of water.This
{718} method of treatment promises more and is more rational than the
internal administration of drugs.Opium and its preparations should be avoided except to control frequent
or watery discharges or to relieve pain, but it is not often that this
is called for if wiser measures are first employed.Any of the remedies
spoken of may be given in the form of suppositories with greater
advantage often than by the mouth.In that more severe class of cases called follicular ulceration, in
which the follicles are known to be ulcerated from a prolongation of
the illness, the obstinacy of the diarrhoea, the character of the
discharges, and the effect upon the general health, other measures are
to be adopted.The diet should be most strictly regulated and the
digestive power of the patient carefully studied.Cod-liver oil is
added with advantage to other foods if there is a lack of nutrition.Aids to gastric digestion are called for.The intestinal lesion is to be reached through the stomach or the
rectum.Nitrate of silver in small doses is more especially applicable,
and is to be preferred to all other drugs in this stage.It is to be
given in small doses and for several weeks.Turpentine and copaiba have something in their favor in ulceration.Ergot has been suggested, and where there is much hemorrhage from the
bowel may be prescribed.Irrigations with solutions of nitrate of silver seem to be a direct and
certain remedy in cases where ulceration has existed for a long time.Two and a half to three pints of distilled water, holding in solution
five grains of nitrate of silver, should be thrown up the rectum as
high as possible with a rubber tube; the effort should be made to
secure immediate exit to the fluid.This procedure is to be repeated
after the bowels are moved--once every day or every other day if the
rectum becomes irritable.[50]

CHOLERA MORBUS.BY W. W. JOHNSTON, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Cholera nostras, Sporadic cholera, European or English
cholera, Spasmodic cholera, Cholera biliosa, Passio cholerica,
Cholerhagia, Trousse-galant, Die Gallenruhr, Brechruhr.DEFINITION.--An affection of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane
characterized by violent abdominal pain, nausea, and sudden, violent,
and incessant vomiting, and by purging of a watery fluid containing
little albumen and bile; attended with spasms of the muscles of the
abdomen and extremities, a pinched and sunken countenance, pallor,
cyanosis, and coldness of the surface of the body; a feeble and rapid
pulse, oppressed respiration, and great restlessness; dryness of the
tongue, great thirst, and diminished or suppressed urinary secretion
and a state approaching collapse, which may rarely prove fatal, but is,
as a rule, followed by reaction.HISTORY.--The term cholera has been in use since the time of
Hippocrates, but he confounded with it every disease which seemed to
him to come from acridity or corruption of humors, as colics and
meteorism with constipation.[1] He well described cholera morbus in
saying that "it is a disease which appears in summer, due to imprudence
in eating, at the same time as intermittent fever."[2] If Celsus be
correct in deriving the name from [Greek: chole] "bile," and [Greek:
reo] "I flow," it is more applicable to the disease now under
consideration than to the Asiatic disease, as it is the bile which is
absent in the colorless rice-water discharges of Asiatic cholera.Trallian and Ruysch, however, ascribe it to [Greek: cholera] the
rain-gutter of a house.les Maladies aigues_, 19, ii.[Footnote 2: _Epidemies_, lib.In the Old Testament mention is made of a disease resembling cholera
morbus.[3] Its true pathogeny was known to Galen, and it was accurately
described by Celsus,[4] and Aretaeus[5] mentions the nature of the
discharges and its frequency among young people and children.des Maladies epidemiques_, Paris, 1825.]The first mention of epidemics was in the sixteenth century.Various
epidemics in 1695, 1717, and 1718 in Germany were probably cholera
morbus.Forestus[6] reports seven observations from 1559 to 1565 of
attacks due to indigestible food or drastic medicines.F. Hoffman,[7]
{720} J. Frank,[8] and L. Riviere speak of the benignity of the disease
as contrasting it with its apparently dangerous symptoms.[Footnote 6: _Opera Omnia_, Rothomagi, 1633, "De stomachi affectibus,"
lib.[Footnote 7: _Medicina rationalis systemica_, t. iv.[Footnote 8: _Praxeos medicae universae praecepta_, Leipzig, 1826, p.Sydenham's[9] description of the epidemics in England in 1669-72 is the
earliest account of the disease in modern literature, and it was he who
gave it the name cholera morbus.NATURE.--There prevails at the present time a great diversity of
opinion in regard to its nature; the want of uniformity in the
appearances presented by post-mortem examinations may in some measure
account for this.The present state of our knowledge, derived both from
pathological anatomy and a study of the symptoms, will not warrant a
positive opinion in regard to it.Niemeyer,[10] in common with most German and some French authors,
considers cholera morbus to be a variety of gastro-intestinal catarrh.Leube[11] thinks it a variety of gastric catarrh with simultaneous
inflammation of the intestines and running a peculiar course.It is
certainly not identical with the specific Asiatic disease, although in
some cases the symptoms and morbid anatomy are exactly similar, and any
differentiation is impossible.By some it is believed that cholera
morbus is due to surviving germs implanted by previous epidemics of
Asiatic cholera.[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, New York, 1876, vol.The slight changes found in some fatal cases would lead to the belief
that the effect of the exciting cause is something more than a
mechanical irritation of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.The sudden onset, rapid development of symptoms, and dangerous collapse
justify the theory that there must be some previous change in the
individual or some peculiar result of food-decomposition.The nervous
system may be so enfeebled by prolonged heat that an irritant quickly
destroys its equilibrium and brings about vaso-motor paralysis of the
intestinal vessels and abundant serum transudation.Or the irritation
may be specific, depending upon the development of poison germs in food
which has been subjected to heat influences.There is a close
relationship between cholera morbus and cholera infantum in their
etiology, symptoms, and pathology.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--The disease is more common in the
tropics, but is not confined to any climate.In temperate latitudes it
is more likely to occur in July and August, when the variation of
temperature between day and night is great, although the other months
of summer and autumn are not entirely exempt.It is said to be more
frequent and fatal in Southern Europe than in the northern and
temperate climates.In periods immediately preceding and following
epidemics of Asiatic cholera many persons are attacked, although there
is great liability to errors in diagnosis at these times.It occurs more frequently in youth and adolescence than in advanced
life, and males seem to be more liable to attacks than females, but
difference in occupation may assist in this predisposition.Persons
endowed with an extreme sensibility of the nervous system and who are
subject to frequent attacks of intestinal catarrh are much more liable
to the disease.The exhaustion of the nervous system by heat, which is
the {721} probable explanation of the phenomena of cholera infantum,
has no doubt much to do with the development of cholera morbus.Mental
anxiety or overwork in summer increases this nerve-exhaustion and
renders the termini of nerves and the centres very susceptible to
peculiar irritation.Exciting Causes.--It is probable that the cause of most attacks is a
septic material generated in the fermentation and decomposition of
food.This poison acts as an irritant upon the gastric and intestinal
nerves and gives rise to excessive peristaltic movements and vomiting.Hence the quality of the food is an element of more importance in the
causation than the mere quantity ingested; and herein may reside the
chief difference between cholera morbus and Asiatic cholera, the latter
being due to a specific, imported, or acclimated poison which
invariably produces the same specific form in those exposed to its
action.[12] Unripe fruits, partially cooked or decaying meats and
vegetables, shellfish and fish some time from the water, may produce
the disease in those predisposed to it.The intemperate use of
ice-water and other cold drinks after a full meal or when the body is
exhausted by heat and fatigue, exposure to showers at the close of a
hot day, or passing from a heated room into damp cellars and
outbuildings, are frequent exciting causes.[Footnote 12: "Bias the pugilist, naturally a great eater, had a sudden
choleraic attack after having eaten of succulent food" (Hippocrates,
lib.At times there exists a certain condition of inactivity of the
digestive organs when the gastric juice is not secreted in sufficient
quantity, and perfectly sound food may undergo fermentation and set up
an attack.The offensive exhalation from a filthy alley which had been recently
cleaned was the exciting cause of a fatal epidemic in a London
school,[13] and Levier recounts an epidemic caused by the
drinking-water during the winter in Berne.[14]

[Footnote 13: _Lond.f. Heilk._, iii., 1864, p.Nervous disturbance from other diseases may act as a cause.Leube
reports a case of intermittent fever which was followed by an annual
attack of cholera morbus preceded by febrile symptoms.[15]

[Footnote 15: Leube, _Ziemssen_, 1876, vol.Malaria, sewer-gas, and sudden and powerful mental emotions are
credited with the causation of some attacks.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--In a few cases an examination of the body has
revealed no phenomena sufficient to account for the symptoms, even when
they have been the most severe during life.In these cases either the
inflammation has not passed the first stage of development and the
resulting hyperaemia has disappeared after death, or the irritation of
the gastro-intestinal nerves has been sufficiently intense to cause
death before the alimentary tract has undergone any consequent
structural change.Usually, however, there are evidences of a general gastro-intestinal
catarrh: the mucous membrane is congested throughout and denuded of
epithelium.The solitary glands are enlarged and Peyer's patches
swollen and prominent.The blood is thickened and dark in color, and
the serous membranes dry, sticky, and covered with desquamated
epithelium.Indeed, the appearances may be identical with those
observed in true Asiatic {722} cholera.The kidneys are congested,
sometimes enlarged, and the tubules devoid of epithelium.In protracted
cases the general muscular system shows a beginning of granular
degeneration.In no case, however, can a positive diagnosis between Asiatic cholera
and cholera morbus be made from post-mortem appearances.SYMPTOMS.--The attack is usually sudden in its onset, but in some cases
is preceded by nausea, thirst, loss of appetite, and slight general
distress for some hours, or it may come on in the course of some
gastro-intestinal disturbance.Frequently it is developed during sleep,
particularly after midnight, the patient being aroused by a feeling of
pressure at the pit of the stomach, which is followed by nausea and
violent and incessant vomiting with intense pain, the contents of the
stomach being ejected with great force.The matters first vomited consist mainly of the food last eaten, little
altered or mixed with gastric mucus and tinged with bile.In a certain
proportion of cases the amount of bile is increased, although it is
difficult to judge of the relative proportion by the color and taste of
the vomited liquid.The general belief that the liver is implicated and
the bile secreted in morbid quantity rests upon conjecture alone, and
has no solid basis.After a time only yellow, brown, or greenish mucus,
with more or less bile, is ejected, and in protracted cases hiccough is
most distressing.Following the vomiting or at the same time with it purging comes on,
and it is usually preceded by borborygmi.In rare cases there is no
vomiting, but only intense pain in the bowels and copious alvine
discharges from the beginning to the end of the attack.The stools in
the beginning are normal in color, but soon become pulpy or semi-fluid.As they increase in quantity they become watery, consisting of
blood-serum with mucus, cast-off epithelium and pus-cells, and are
nearly odorless, and sometimes resemble very closely the discharges of
Asiatic cholera, but almost invariably retain the yellow or green color
of the bile.Colorless rice-water discharges are observed in undoubted
cases of cholera morbus outside of any epidemic influence.The
discharges are acrid and irritating, and the neighboring parts become
red and excoriated.At the same time there is intense burning or tearing pain in the
abdomen, generally centring at the umbilicus, great thirst and painful
contractions of the muscles of the abdomen and extremities,
particularly in the calves of the legs, and of the flexors of the
thighs, forearms, fingers, and toes.In the beginning there may be
tympanites, but this soon disappears, and the abdomen becomes retracted
and the muscles drawn up into knots.The cramps usually come on after
each act of vomiting and purging, but they may appear spontaneously.Abdominal tenderness is either wanting or slight.As the transudation
continues the thirst becomes intense, the tongue cold, dry, and coated,
and the tissues shrivelled from loss of water.The skin is cold,
clammy, or covered with a viscid sweat, and the surface of the body is
cyanosed, violet, or in the extremities it may have a marbled
appearance.The nose is pointed, the eyes dark and sunken, and there is
a general appearance of collapse.The mind may be clear throughout, but in protracted cases there is
great nervous prostration.The patient becomes dull and lethargic,
passing into stupor after great restlessness and jactitation.The voice
is faint {723} or whispering, the breath cold, and the respiration
sighing.The pulse in the beginning may be depressed, but soon becomes
rapid and often imperceptible, and there is great praecordial anxiety.As the blood becomes thickened the urine is highly, small in
quantity, and it may be suppressed.An examination shows traces of
albumen, casts and desquamated epithelium, and a decrease in the amount
of urea and salts.In the last stages there may be a slight rise in
temperature, but it has no definite course and it is usually absent.In
collapse the temperature of the surface of the body sinks below normal,
but the temperature of the interior may rise as high as 101 degrees or
102 degrees F., as shown by the thermometer in the rectum or
vagina.[16]

[Footnote 16: _London Hosp.PROGRESS AND TERMINATION.--But, fortunately, the course of the disease
tends toward recovery in the large majority of cases.The discharges
gradually decrease in quantity, the intervals are longer, the
appearance becomes more natural, and a profuse perspiration is followed
by a refreshing sleep.The surface becomes warmer, the pulse slower and
more full, and the skin regains its normal color.If the case has been a severe one or if it occurs in a person much
enfeebled by disease, it pursues a different course.The discharges
become almost uninterrupted, and at last are passed involuntarily.The
cramps are almost continuous or are convulsive, the pulse grows rapidly
weaker and is finally lost, coma succeeds stupor, and death follows in
collapse.The duration of the disease varies from a few hours to two or three
days; death has occurred within twelve hours.Recovery is generally complete after a few hours; and this rapid return
to the normal condition shows that there have been no textural change
of organs.Sometimes great emaciation, irritability of the stomach, and
slight diarrhoea persist for a few days, or symptoms of a general
gastro-enteritis may supervene.DIAGNOSIS.--In making the diagnosis of cholera morbus it is necessary
to carefully differentiate it from epidemic cholera and the effects
produced by irritant poisons, such as the metallic salts, poisonous
fungi, etc.Occurring during an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, it is not possible to
make a diagnosis, as the symptoms of cholera morbus and of mild cases
of the Asiatic disease are identical.From severe cases it is to be
distinguished by the absence of antecedent diarrhoea, by the presence
of bile in the vomited matters, and by the color and fecal odor of the
stools.The nausea and abdominal pain are more marked, while the
dyspnoea, cyanosis, and shrunken condition of the skin are less marked.The mortality of cholera morbus is slight, whilst about one-half of
those attacked with epidemic cholera die.In irritant poisoning the vomiting follows quickly after the ingestion
of a meal or poisonous matter; it continues for some time before
purging begins, and is out of all proportion to the diarrhoea.The
vomited matters contain blood and mucus and are never serous in
character.Corrosive poisons may cause redness, charring, or ulceration
of the mouth and throat and a burning sensation in the stomach.The
pain over the stomach is more constant and severe, particularly in the
intervals of {724} vomiting, and there may be abdominal tenderness and
bloody discharges.The expression is more anxious and the pulse rapid
and weak.Elaterium and tartar emetic will bring on vomiting and purging which
resemble the symptoms of cholera morbus.Choleriform attacks due to
uraemia simulate cholera morbus.The distinction is to be made by the
previous history--pain and purging being relatively less prominent in
uraemia--by the presence of albumen and casts in the urine, and by the
early tendency to coma.Acute peritonitis, attended by copious vomiting and purging, has been
mistaken for cholera morbus, and the true nature of the affection only
revealed by the autopsy.PROGNOSIS.--As a rule, cholera morbus occurring in persons otherwise
healthy ends favorably in a few hours.Cases of secondary fever, with
gastro-intestinal catarrh, may prolong the attack from a few days to
two weeks.Should treatment have no effect in lessening the vomiting
and purging, and should the evidences of heart-failure become apparent,
a fatal result may be feared.Death has occurred within twelve hours,
and the mortality is 3 per cent.[17]

[Footnote 17: Bartholow, _Pract.Med._, New York, 1880, p.Cases occurring in the course of other diseases possess a special
gravity.TREATMENT.--During the summer months, and particularly in August and
September, when the hot days are succeeded by cool nights, iced drinks
should be used in moderate quantities; the diet should be light,
nutritious, and easy of digestion.Unripe fruits and articles of food
liable to fermentative changes should not be indulged in.Exposure to the night air, particularly after a full meal, should be
especially avoided, and the clothing ought to be so arranged that
additions may be made as night approaches.Slight attacks of
indigestion should not be neglected, and any irregularity of the bowels
must receive immediate attention.The period when the physician is called upon to prescribe for an attack
of cholera morbus is usually when the stomach has been emptied of food
and the patient is vomiting incessantly, purging, and writhing in pain.If vomiting has not occurred and violent epigastric pain is the only
symptom, the stomach should be emptied by an emetic of hot water and
mustard repeated until the overcharged organ is completely emptied.Partially-digested food in a state of acid fermentation will thus be
got rid of, and the sufferings may be immediately but not wholly
relieved.If spontaneous vomiting has expelled the food, and the matters vomited
are green and watery, while pain and frequent stools with muscular
cramps, heart feebleness, and threatening collapse are the symptoms
presented, the remedy par excellence is a hypodermic injection of
sulphate of morphia (gr.1/8 to 1/3) with sulphate of atropia (gr.If one dose is not followed by decided mitigation of
suffering, the injection is to be repeated in a half hour or an hour,
not giving above one grain of morphia in divided doses.At the same
time, and while waiting for the full effect of the narcotic, efforts
can be directed to giving ease to the muscular spasms and pain by brisk
friction with stimulating lotions or by mustard poultices to the
abdomen and extremities.The morphia will be the best and quickest
stimulant which can be used; it will therefore be useless in most cases
to administer brandy, camphor, chloroform, {725} or other remedies of
that sort.Waiting and giving nothing by the mouth is the wiser course.In twenty minutes to half an hour the most perfect bien etre succeeds
to the previous agony and exhaustion.In some cases the vomiting,
purging, and cramps cease more gradually, and six hours will pass
before the patient is at ease.The intense thirst is best treated by
the giving of cracked ice sparingly at first, more freely later.Nothing substitutes morphia hypodermically with success, but in some
instances or when the stomach is not very irritable it may be necessary
to give medicine by the mouth.In this case chloroform (xv to xxx
drops), chlorodyne (x to xx drops), or spirits of camphor (v to x
drops) every quarter or half hour in ice-water may be directed.Chloroform and camphor can be combined with the deodorized tincture of
opium in ten- to twenty-drop doses.Time is wasted in expecting relief
from remedies which are inevitably rejected as soon as taken; it is
only when the stomach is very tolerant that it is judicious to begin
with them.The weakness of the heart's action must be combated by brandy or
whiskey, given by the mouth with pounded ice or administered
hypodermically.A considerable quantity of brandy or diluted alcohol
may be introduced by repeated injections beneath the skin.Iced
champagne may be tried with good effect.H. C. Wood quotes Hall[18] as
recommending hypodermic injections of chloral in the cold stage of
cholera.Five to eight grains in twenty minims of distilled water can
be thus given, and repeated at intervals of fifteen to twenty minutes
until some effect is perceived.[Footnote 18: _Lancet_, May 2, 1874.]If vomiting persists after the other symptoms--pain and muscular
spasms--are relieved, it is due to the intense gastric hyperaemia;
giving nothing which is not necessary is the wiser plan.Carbolic acid,
hydrocyanic acid, bismuth, bromide of sodium, or small doses of calomel
are remedies which meet the indication.Food should be withheld as long
as possible; then iced barley-water, followed by milk and lime-water in
very small quantities at short intervals, will test the power of the
stomach to retain and digest food.{726}

INTESTINAL AFFECTIONS OF CHILDREN IN HOT WEATHER.BY J. LEWIS SMITH, M.D.The summer affections of the intestines in children are chiefly of a
diarrhoeal character.Diarrhoeal attacks, as is well known, are much
more frequent and severe in the summer months than in other portions of
the year.Moreover, the diarrhoea of the summer season occurs chiefly
among children under the age of two and a half years, and is much more
common and fatal in the cities than in the country.In the large cities
this malady has heretofore been the annually-recurring scourge of
infancy, but of late years its prevalence has been in some degree
diminished and its severity controlled by the establishment of health
boards and the enforcement of sanitary regulations.Still, it remains
an important disease in all our cities, and one that largely increases
the aggregate mortality.The truth of this statement is shown by the
statistics of deaths taken at random from the mortuary records of any
large city.Thus, in New York City during 1882 the deaths from
diarrhoea reported to the Health Board, tabulated in months, were as
follows:

        Jan.Under
  five   34   32   50   50   72   231  1533  817   362  195   68   35
  years.Over
  five   14   15   14   20   15    19   131  149    84   55   31   24
  years.Therefore, in 1882--and the statistics of other years correspond in
this particular--it is seen that nine times as many deaths of children
under the age of five years occurred from diarrhoea during the five
months from June 1st to October 31st as in the remaining seven months
of the year.It is also seen, in corroboration of the statement that
diarrhoea due to hot weather is chiefly a disease of infancy and early
childhood, that during these same five months, which embrace the summer
season, the number of deaths from diarrhoea under the age of five years
was seven and a half times greater than the number over that age.These
statistics agree with the general experience of physicians in city
practice.The summer diarrhoea would indeed be comparatively
unimportant were its death-rate as low in the first five years of life
as subsequently.The following statistics show how great a destruction of life this
malady causes even under the surveillance of an energetic health board;
and before this board was established it was much greater, as I had
abundant opportunities to observe.The last annual report of the New
York Board of Health was made in 1875, since which time weekly
bulletins have been {727} issued.The deaths from diarrhoea at all ages
in the three last years in which annual reports were issued were as
follows:

              1873.January       94     43     46
  February      84     34     52
  March         97     40     58
  April        114     47     45
  May           95     61     89
  June         220    144    157
  July        1514   1205   1387
  August       967   1007   1012
  September    424    587    608
  October      213    255    185
  November      87    105     57
  December      53     56     50

Thus, in these three years the aggregate deaths from diarrhoea during
the months from June to October inclusive, in which months the summer
diarrhoea prevails, were 9885, while in the remaining seven months the
number was only 1407.How large a proportion of these deaths in the
warm season occurred in children we may infer from remarks made by the
Health Board in regard to another year.In their annual report for 1870
the board state: "The mortality from the diarrhoeal affections amounted
to 2789, or 33 per cent.of the total deaths; and of these deaths 95
per cent.occurred in children less than five years old, 92 per cent.in children less than two years old, and 67 per cent.Every year the reports of the Health Board furnish
similar statistics, but enough have been given to show how great a
sacrifice of life the summer complaint produces annually in this city.What we observe in New York in reference to this disease is true also,
to a greater or less extent, in other cities of this country and
Europe, so far as we have reports.Not in every city is there the same
proportionate mortality from this cause as in New York, but the
frequency of the summer diarrhoea and the mortality which attends it
render it an important disease in, I believe, most cities of both
continents.In country towns, whether in villages or farm-houses, this
disease is comparatively unimportant, inasmuch as few cases occur in
them, and the few that do occur are of mild type, and consequently much
less fatal than in the cities.The comparative immunity of the rural districts has an important
relation, as we will see, to the hygienic management of these cases.ETIOLOGY.--In the causation of this disease two distinct factors are
recognized--the one atmospheric, the other dietetic.The prevalence and severity of the summer diarrhoea correspond closely
with the degree of atmospheric heat, as may be inferred from the
foregoing statistics.In New York this disease begins in the month of
May--earlier in some years than in others--in a few scattered cases,
commonly of a mild type.Cases become more and more numerous and severe
as the weather grows warmer until July and August, when the diarrhoea
attains its maximum prevalence and severity.In these two months it is
by far the most frequent and fatal of all the diseases in cities.In
the middle of September new patients begin to be less common, and in
the latter part of this month and subsequently new cases do not occur,
unless under unusual circumstances which favor the development of this
malady.In New York a considerable number of deaths {728} of infants
occur from the diarrhoea in October.October is not a hot month in our
latitude--its average temperature is lower than that of May--and yet
the mortality from this disease is considerably larger in the former
than in the latter month.This fact, which seems to show that the
prevalence of the summer diarrhoea does not correspond with the degree
of atmospheric heat, is readily explained.The mortality in October,
and indeed in the latter part of September, is not that of new cases,
but is mainly of infants, as I have observed every year, who contract
the disease in July or August or earlier, and linger in a state of
emaciation and increasing weakness till they finally succumb, some even
in cool weather.The fact is therefore undisputed, and is universally admitted, that the
summer season, stated in a general way, is the cause of this
annually-recurring diarrhoeal epidemic, but it is not so easy to
determine what are the exact causative conditions or agents which the
summer weather brings into activity.That atmospheric heat does not in
itself cause the diarrhoea is evident from the fact that in the rural
districts there is the same intensity of heat as in the cities, and yet
the summer complaint does not occur.The cause must be looked for in
that state of the atmosphere engendered by heat where unsanitary
conditions exist, as in large cities.Moreover, observations show that
the noxious effluvia with which the air becomes polluted under such
circumstances constitute or contain the morbific agent.Thus, in one of
the institutions of this city a few years since, on May 10, which
happened to be an unusually warm day for this month, an offensive odor
was noticed in the wards, which was traced to a large manure-heap that
was being upturned in an adjacent garden.On this day four young
children were severely attacked by diarrhoea, and one died.Many other
examples might be cited showing how the foul air of the city during the
hot months, when animal and vegetable decomposition is most active,
causes diarrhoea.Several years since, while serving as sanitary
inspector for the Citizens' Association in one of the city districts,
my attention was particularly called to one of the streets, in which a
house-to-house visitation disclosed the fact that nearly every infant
between two avenues had the diarrhoea, and usually in a severe form,
not a few dying.This street was compactly built with wooden
tenement-houses on each side, and contained a dense population, mainly
foreign, poor, ignorant, and filthy in their habits.It had no sewer,
and the refuse of the kitchens and bed-chambers was thrown into the
street, where it accumulated in heaps.Water trickled down over the
sidewalks from the houses into the gutters or was thrown out as slops,
so that it kept up a constant moisture of the refuse matter which
covered the street, and promoted the decay of the animal and vegetable
substances which it contained.The air in the domicils and street under
such conditions of impurity was necessarily foul in the extreme, and
stifling during the hot days and nights of July and August; and it was
evidently the important factor in producing the numerous and severe
diarrhoeal cases which were in these domicils.In another locality, occupied by tripe-dealers and a low class of
butchers who carried on fat- and bone-boiling at night, the air was so
foul after dark that the peculiar impurity which tainted it could be
distinctly noticed in the mouth for a considerable time after a night
visit.In the street where {729} these nuisances existed and in
adjacent streets the summer diarrhoea was very prevalent and
destructive to human life.Murchison states that twenty out of
twenty-five boys were affected with purging and vomiting from inhaling
the effluvia from the contents of an old drain near their school-room.Physicians are familiar with a similar fact showing this purgative
effect of impure air--that the atmosphere of a dissecting-room often
causes diarrhoea in those otherwise healthy.The exact nature of the deleterious agent or agents in foul air which
cause the diarrhoea, whether they be gases or organisms, has not been
fully determined; but at a recent meeting of the Berliner Med.Gesellschaft, A. Baginsky made a report on the bacilli of cholera
infantum, which he states he has found both in the dejections and in
the intestinal mucous membrane in the bodies of those who have perished
with this disease.In the stools, along with numerous other organisms,
Baginsky states that he found masses of zoogloea, and the same
organisms he detected on the surface of the small intestines, and could
trace their wanderings as far as the submucous tissue.[1] But it is
evidently very difficult to determine whether such organisms sustain a
causative relation to diarrhoea or spring into existence in consequence
of the foul secretions and decomposing fecal matters which are present.The impurities in the air of a large city are very numerous.Among
those of a gaseous nature are sulphurous acid, sulphuric acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen; various gases of the carbon group, as carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide; gases of the nitrogen
group, as the acetate, sulphide, and carbonate of ammonium, nitrous and
nitric acids; and at times compounds of phosphorus and chlorine
(Parkes).A theory deserving consideration is that certain gaseous
impurities found in the air form purgative combinations.D. F. Lincoln,
in his interesting paper on the atmosphere in the _Cyclopaedia of
Medicine_, writes in regard to sulphuretted hydrogen: "When in the air,
freely exposed to the contact of oxygen, it becomes sulphuric acid.Sulphide of ammonium in the same circumstances becomes a sulphate,
which, encountering common salt (chloride of sodium), produces sulphate
of sodium and chloride of ammonium.The sulphates form a characteristic
ingredient of the air in manufacturing districts."The sulphates, we
know, are for the most part purgatives, but whether they or other
chemical agents exist in the respired air in sufficient quantity to
disturb the action of the intestines, even where atmospheric impurities
are most abundant, is problematical and uncertain.Again, the solid impurities in the air of a large city are very
numerous, as any one may observe by viewing a sunbeam in a darkened
room, which is made visible by the numerous particles floating in it.These particles consist largely of organic matter, which sometimes has
been carried a long distance by the wind.The remarkable statement has
been made that in the air of Berlin organic forms have been found of
African production.Ehrenberg discovered fragments of insects of
various kinds--rhizopods, tardigrades, polygastrica, etc.--which,
existing in considerable quantity and inhaled in hot weather, when
decomposition and fermentation are most active, may be deleterious to
the system.Monads, bacteria, vibriones, amorphous dust containing
spores which {730} retain their vitality for months, are among the
substances found in the air of cities.The well-known hazy appearance
of the atmosphere resting over a large city like New York when viewed
from a distance is due to the gaseous and solid impurities with which
the air is so abundantly supplied--impurities which assume importance
in pathological studies, since minute organisms are now believed to
cause so many diseases the etiology of which has heretofore been
obscure.With our present knowledge we must be content with the general
statement that impure air is one of the two important factors which
cause summer diarrhoea, without being able to state positively which of
the elements in the air are most instrumental in causing this result.But the theory is plausible that minute organisms rather than chemical
products are the chief cause.Henoch of Berlin, writing upon this
subject, calls attention to the disease known as intestinal mycosis,
its prominent symptom being a severe diarrhoea produced by eating
diseased meat containing a fungus.He believes that "a portion of the
fungus not destroyed by the gastric juice settles upon different parts
of the intestine, and there produces its effects;" and he adds, "At
present, however, we can regard the mykotic theory of cholera infantum
only as a very probable hypothesis.There is no doubt that high
atmospheric temperature increases the tendency to fermentation
dyspepsias which is present in imperfectly-nourished children at all
seasons, and causes them to appear not only epidemically, but also in
an extremely acute form which is not frequent under ordinary
circumstances.This would lead to the conclusion that, in addition to
the heat, infectious germs are present, which, being developed in great
masses by the former, enter the stomach with the food."The fungus
theory of the causative relation of atmospheric heat to the diarrhoea
of the summer season as thus explained by Henoch commands the readier
assent since it comports with the well-known facts relating to the
etiology of the summer complaint.This disease, as we have seen, is
most prevalent and fatal under precisely those conditions of dense
population, filthy domicils and streets, and atmospheric heat which are
favorable for the development of low organisms.In those portions of our cities which are occupied by the poor, more
than anywhere else, those conditions prevail which render the
atmosphere deleterious.One accustomed to the pure air of the country
would scarcely believe how stifling and poisonous the atmosphere
becomes during the hot summer days and close summer nights in and
around the domicils in the poor quarters of the city.Among the causes
of this foul air may be mentioned too dense a population, the occupancy
of small rooms by large families, rigid economy and ceaseless endeavor
to make ends meet, so that in the absorbing interest sanitary
requirements are sadly neglected.Adults of such families, and children
of both sexes as soon as they are old enough, engage in laborious and
often filthy occupations.Many of them seldom bathe, and they often
wear for days the same undergarments, foul with perspiration and dirt.The intemperate, vicious, and indolent, who always abound in the
quarters of the city poor, are notoriously filthy in their habits and
add to the insalubrity by their presence.Children old enough to be in
the streets and adults away at their occupations escape to a great
extent the evil effects of impure air, but the infantile population
always suffer severely.Every physician who has witnessed the summer diarrhoea of infants is
{731} aware of the fact that the mode of feeding has much to do with
its occurrence.A large proportion of those who each summer fall
victims to it would doubtless escape if the feeding were exactly
proper.In New York City facts like the following are of common
occurrence in the practice of all physicians: Infants under the age of
eight months, if bottle-fed, nearly always contract diarrhoea, and
usually of an obstinate character, during the summer months.The
younger the infant, the less able is it to digest any other food than
breast-milk, and the more liable is it therefore to suffer from
diarrhoea if bottle-fed.In the institutions nearly every bottle-fed
infant under the age of four or even six months dies in the hot months
with symptoms of indigestion and intestinal catarrh, while the
wet-nursed of the same ages remain well.Sudden weaning, the sudden
substitution of cow's milk or any artificially-prepared food in place
of breast-milk in hot weather, almost always produces diarrhoea, often
of a severe and fatal nature.Feeding an infant in the hot months with
indigestible and improper food, as fruits with seeds or the ordinary
table-food prepared in such a way that it overtaxes the digestive
function of the infant, causes diarrhoea, and not infrequently that
severe form of it which will be described under the term cholera
infantum.Many obstinate cases of the summer complaint begin to improve
under change of diet, as by the substitution of one kind of milk for
another or the return of the infant to the breast after it has been
temporarily withdrawn from it.It is a common remark in the families of
the city poor that the second summer is the period of greatest danger
to infants.This increased liability of infants to contract diarrhoea
in the second summer is due to the fact that most infants in their
second year are table-fed, while in the first year they are wet-nursed.Such facts, with which all physicians are familiar, show how important
the diet is as a factor in causing the summer complaint.Occasionally, from continued ill-health, the milk of the mother or
wet-nurse does not agree with the nursling.Examined with the
microscope, it is found to contain colostrum.Under such circumstances
if a healthy wet-nurse be employed the diarrhoea ceases.It is very
important that any woman furnishing breast-milk to an infant should
lead a quiet and regular life, with regular meals and sleep.19, 1882, R. B. Gilbert relates
striking cases in which venereal excesses on the part of wet-nurses
were immediately followed by fatal diarrhoea in the infants which they
suckled.One not a resident would scarcely be able to appreciate the difficulty
which is experienced in a large city in obtaining proper diet for young
children, especially those of such an age that they require milk as the
basis of their food.Milk from cows stabled in the city or having a
limited pasturage near the city, and fed upon a mixture of hay with
garden and distillery products, the latter often largely predominating,
is unsuitable.It is deficient in nutritive properties, prone to
fermentation, and from microscopical and chemical examinations which
have been made it appears that it often contains deleterious
ingredients.If milk be obtained from distant farms where pasturage is
fresh and abundant--and in New York City this is the usual source of
the supply--considerable time elapses before it is served to customers,
so that, particularly in the hot months of July and August, it
frequently has begun to undergo {732} lactic-acid fermentation when the
infants receive it.That dispensed to families in the morning is the
milking of the previous morning and evening.The common result of the
use of this milk in midsummer by infants under the age of ten months is
more or less diarrhoea.The ill-success of feeding with cow's milk has led to the preparation
of various kinds of food which the shops contain, but no dietetic
preparation has yet appeared which agrees so well with the digestive
function of the infant as breast-milk, and is at the same time
sufficiently nutritive.In New York City improper diet, unaided by the conditions which hot
weather produces, is a common cause of diarrhoea in young infants, for
we meet with this diarrhoea in infants who are bottle-fed at all
seasons; but when the atmospheric conditions of hot weather and the use
of food unsuitable for the age of the infant are both present and
operative, this diarrhoea so increases in frequency and severity that
it is proper to designate it the summer epidemic of the cities.Several
years since, before the New York Foundling Asylum was established, the
foundlings of New York, more than a thousand annually, were taken to
the almshouse on Blackwell's Island and consigned to the care of the
pauper-women, who were mostly old, infirm, and filthy in their habits
and apparel.Their beds, in which the foundlings were also placed
alongside of them, were seldom clean, not properly aired and washed,
and under the beds were various garments and utensils which these
pauper-women had brought with them as their sole property from their
miserable abodes in the city.With such surroundings, the air which
these infants breathed day and night manifestly contained poisonous
emanations; while their diet was equally improper, for it was prepared
by these women from such milk and farinaceous food as were furnished
the almshouse.When assigned to duty in the almshouse, this service
being at that time a branch of Charity Hospital, I was informed that
all the foundlings died before the age of two months; one only was
pointed out as a curiosity which had been an exception to the rule.The
disease of which they perished was diarrhoea, and this malady in the
summer months was especially severe and rapidly fatal.The unpleasant
experiences in this institution furnished additional evidence, were any
wanting, that foul air and improper diet are the two important factors
in causing the summer diarrhoea of infants.Since that beneficial
charity, the New York Foundling Asylum, in East Sixty-eighth street,
came into existence, providing pure air and, for a considerable
proportion of the foundlings, breast-milk, many of these waifs have
been rescued from death.I have already stated that this disease occurs, with an occasional
exception, under the age of two and a half years.The following table
embraces all the cases that came to one of the city dispensaries during
my service between the months of May and October, inclusive:

       Age.5 months or under         58
   5 months to 12 months    212
  12 months to 18 months    174
  18 months to 24 months     93
  24 months to 36 months     36
                            ---
        Total               573

After the third year the liability to the summer complaint so rapidly
{733} diminishes that comparatively few are affected by it.It is seen
from the above statistics that by far the largest number of cases occur
during the period of first dentition; hence the prevalent opinion among
families that dentition causes the diarrhoea.It is the common belief
among the poor of New York that diarrhoea occurring during dentition is
conservative, and should not be checked.They believe that an infant
cutting its teeth suffers less, and may be saved from serious illness,
if it have frequent stools.Every summer I see infants reduced to a
state of imminent danger through the continuance of diarrhoea during
several weeks, nothing having been done to check it in consequence of
this absurd belief.The progressive loss of flesh and strength and
wasting of the features do not excite alarm, under the blinding
influence of this theory, till the diarrhoea has continued so long and
become so severe that it is with difficulty controlled, and the patient
is in a state of real danger when the physician is first summoned.The
following statistics, which comprise cases occurring during my service
in one of the city dispensaries, show the preponderance of cases during
the age when dental evolution is occurring:

                                              Cases.No teeth and no marked turgescence of gums    47
  Cutting incisors                             106
     "    anterior molars                       41
     "    canines                               40
     "    last molars                           20
  All the teeth cut                             28
                                               ---
        Total                                  282

It so happens that the period of dental evolution corresponds with that
of the most rapid development and the greatest functional activity of
the gastric and intestinal follicles, and the predisposition which
exists to diarrhoeal maladies at this age must be attributed to this
cause rather than to dentition.SYMPTOMS.--The summer diarrhoea of infants commonly begins gradually
with languor, fretfulness, and slight febrile movement.The diarrhoea
at first usually attracts little attention from its mildness.The
stools, while they are thinner than natural, vary in appearance, being
yellow, brown, or green.Infants with milk diet are apt to pass green
and acid stools containing particles of undigested casein.The tongue
in the commencement of the attack is moist and covered with a slight
fur.At a more advanced stage it may be moist, but is often dry, and in
dangerous forms of the malady, accompanied by prostration, the buccal
surface is red and the gums more or less swollen and sometimes
ulcerated.It may commence simultaneously with the
diarrhoea, especially when food that is unusually indigestible and
irritating to the stomach has been given, but more frequently this
symptom does not appear until the diarrhoea has continued a few days.I
preserved memoranda of the date when vomiting began in the cases
treated in two consecutive summers, and found that ordinarily it was
toward the close of the first week.When it is an early and prominent
symptom it appears to be due to the presence in the stomach of
imperfectly digested or fermented and acid food, which, when ejected,
gives a decidedly acid reaction with appropriate tests.It contains
coagulated casein and undigested particles of whatever food has been
given.In many patients the progressive loss of flesh and {734}
strength is largely due to the indigestion and vomiting by which the
food, which is so much required for proper nourishment, is lost.Emesis occurring at a late stage of the summer complaint is often due
to commencing spurious hydrocephalus, which is not an infrequent
complication, as we will see, of protracted cases.Perhaps when a late
symptom it may sometimes have an uraemic origin, for the urine is
usually quite scanty in advanced cases.It seems probable, however,
that deleterious effects from non-elimination of urea are to a
considerable extent prevented by the diarrhoea.The fecal evacuations may remain nearly uniform in appearance during
the disease, but in many patients they vary in color and consistence at
different periods.In the same case they may be brown and offensive at
one time, green at another, and again they may contain masses of a
putty-like appearance, the partly-digested casein or altered epithelial
cells.The stools sometimes consist largely of mucus, with or without
occasional streaks of blood, indicating the predominance of
inflammation in the colon.This is the mucous diarrhoea of Barrier.The
stools are sometimes yellow when passed, but become green on exposure
to the air from chemical reaction due to admixture with the urine.The character of the alvine discharges is interesting.In addition to
undigested casein I have found epithelial cells, single or in clusters
(sometimes regularly arranged as if detached in mass from the villi),
fibres of meat, crystalline formations, mucus, and occasionally blood,
as stated above.In one instance I observed an appearance resembling
three or four crypts of Lieberkuhn united, probably thrown off by
ulceration.If the stools are green, <DW52> masses of various sizes,
but mostly small, are also seen under the microscope.The pulse is accelerated according to the severity of the attack.The
heat of the surface is at first apt to be increased, though but
slightly in ordinary cases; but when the vital powers begin to fail
from the continuance of the diarrhoea the warmth of the surface
diminishes.In advanced cases approaching a fatal termination the face
and extremities are pallid and cool, and the pulse gradually becomes
more frequent and feeble.The skin is usually dry, and, as already
stated, the urinary secretion diminished.In severe cases attended by
frequent alvine discharges the infant does not pass urine oftener than
once or twice daily.The imperfect action of the skin and kidneys is
noteworthy.Protracted cases of the summer complaint are apt to be complicated by
two cutaneous eruptions--erythema extending over the perineum and
frequently as far as the thighs and lower part of the abdomen, due to
the acid and irritating character of the stools; and boils upon the
forehead and scalp.The latter sometimes extend to the pericranium, and
in case of recovery leave permanent cicatrices.This furuncular
affection of the scalp has seemed to me useful in consequence of the
external irritation which it causes, since it occurs at a time when, on
account of the feeble heart's action and languid circulation, passive
congestion of the vessels of the brain and meninges is liable to be
present.Patients who are weak and wasted in consequence of protracted
diarrhoea, remaining almost constantly in the recumbent position, often
have an occasional dry cough which continues till the close of life.It
is due to hypostatic congestion in the lungs, usually limited to the
posterior and {735} inferior portions of the lobes, extending but a
little way into the lungs.It is the result of prolonged recumbency
with feeble heart's action and feeble pulmonary circulation.Infants
reduced by chronic diseases, lying day after day in their cribs with
little movement of their bodies, are very liable to this passive
congestion of depending portions of their lungs, toward which the blood
gravitates, and into which but little air enters in consequence of
their distance and position and the feeble respirations.The hyperaemia
which results is of a passive character, a venous congestion, and the
affected lobules have a dusky-red color.This congestion, continuing,
soon results in pneumonitis of the catarrhal form, subacute and of a
low grade, for pulmonary lobules in which the blood remains stagnant
soon exhibit augmented cell-proliferation, perhaps from the irritating
effects of the elements of the blood now withdrawn from the
circulation.I have made or procured a considerable number of microscopic
examinations in these cases of hypostatic pneumonia, and the
solidification of the pulmonary lobules has been found to be due to the
exaggerated development of the epithelial cells in the alveoli,
together with venous congestion.The affected lobules, whether in the
stage of hypostatic congestion or the more advanced stage of hypostatic
pneumonitis, when examined at the autopsy, were somewhat softer than in
health, of dark color, and many of the lobules could be inflated by
strong force of the breath; but in protracted cases the alveoli in
central parts of the inflamed area resisted insufflation.The lung in
hypostatic pneumonia, even when it is inflated, still feels firmer
between the fingers than normal lung.Hypostatic pneumonia is so common in hospitals for infants that some
physicians whose observations have been chiefly in such institutions
have almost ignored other forms of pulmonary inflammation.Billard,
many years ago, wrote: "... The pneumonia of young children is
evidently the result of stagnation of blood in their lungs.Under these
circumstances the blood may be regarded as a kind of foreign body."Of
all the chronic and exhausting diseases of infancy, no one has,
according to my observations, been so frequently complicated by
hypostatic pneumonia as the disease which we are considering, although
it does not usually give rise to any more prominent symptom than an
occasional cough.Limited to a small and almost immovable part of the
lung, it does not ordinarily accelerate respiration or render it
painful, and the cough is also apparently painless.When progressive loss of flesh and strength has continued several
weeks, and the patient is much exhausted, another complication is apt
to occur, known as spurious hydrocephalus or the hydrocephaloid
disease, the anatomical characters of which will be described in the
proper place.The commencement of spurious hydrocephalus is announced
by gradually increasing drowsiness, perhaps preceded by a period of
unusual fretfulness.Vomiting and rolling the head are occasional early
symptoms of this complication.As the drowsiness increases the pupils
become less sensitive to light than in their normal state, and are
usually contracted.When the drowsiness becomes profound and constant,
the pupils remain contracted as in sound sleep or in opium narcotism.The functional activity of the organs is now also diminished, the
vomiting ceases, the stools become less frequent, the buccal surface
dry, and the urine more {736} scanty, while the pulse is more frequent
and feeble.Spurious hydrocephalus either continues till death, or by
stimulation the patient may emerge from it.Although the summer complaint in its commencement may be promptly
arrested by proper hygienic and medicinal treatment, if it continue a
few weeks the anatomical changes which occur are such that recovery, if
it take place, is necessarily slow and gradual.Improvement is shown by
better digestion, fewer stools and of better appearance, less frequent
vomiting, a more cheerful countenance, and the absence of symptoms
which indicate a complication.Many recover after days of anxious
watching and perhaps after many fluctuations.Death may occur early from a sudden aggravation of symptoms and rapid
sinking, or the attack may be so violent from the first that the infant
quickly succumbs; but more frequently death takes place after a
prolonged sickness.Little by little the patient loses flesh and
strength, till a state of marked emaciation is reached.The eyes and
cheeks are sunken, the bony projections of the face, trunk, and limbs
become prominent, and the skin lies in wrinkles from the wasting.The
altered expression of the face makes the patient look older than the
actual age.The joints in contrast with the wasted extremities seem
enlarged and the fingers and toes elongated.The stools diminish in
frequency from diminished peristaltic and vermicular action, and
vomiting, if previously present, now ceases.A feeble, quick, and
scarcely appreciable pulse, slow respiration, and diminished inflation
of the lungs, sightless and contracted pupils, over which the eyelids
no longer close, announce the near approach of death.The drowsiness
increases and the limbs become cool, while perhaps the head is hot.The
infant no longer has the ability to nurse, or if bottle-fed the food
placed in the mouth flows back or is swallowed with apparent
indifference.So low is its vitality that it lies pallid and almost
motionless for hours or even days before death, and death occurs so
quietly that the moment of its occurrence is scarcely appreciable.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Since the prominent and essential symptoms of
the disease which we are considering pertain to the digestive
apparatus, it is evident that the lesions which attend and characterize
it are to be found in this part of the system.Lesions elsewhere, so
far as they are appreciable to us, are secondary and not essential.I
have witnessed a large number of autopsies of infants who have perished
from the summer complaint, chiefly in institutions, and they have been
sufficiently marked and uniform to enable us to designate it an
entero-colitis.Several years since I preserved records of the
autopsical appearances in the intestinal catarrh of infants, most of
the cases being of summer diarrhoea.Since then I have each summer witnessed autopsies in the institutions
in cases of this disease, and the lesions observed were the same as in
the eighty-two cases.The question may properly be asked: Can inflammatory hyperaemia of the
intestinal mucous membrane be distinguished from simple congestion if
there be no ulceration and no appreciable thickening of the intestine?It is possible that occasionally I have recorded as inflammatory what
was simply a congestive lesion, but I do not think I have incorporated
a {737} sufficient number of such cases to vitiate the statistics.In a
large proportion of the cases there was evident thickening of the
intestinal mucous membrane or other unequivocal evidence of
inflammation.The following is an analysis of the eighty-two cases:

The duodenum and jejunum presented the appearance of inflammatory
hyperaemia in 12 cases.The hyperaemia was usually in patches of
variable extent or of that form described by the term arborescent.In
51 cases the duodenal and jejunal mucous membrane was pale and without
any other appearance characteristic of catarrh or inflammation.In the
remaining 19 cases the appearance of the duodenum and jejunum was not
recorded, so that it was probably normal.On the other hand, in the
ileum inflammatory lesions were present as a rule.In 49 cases I found
the surface of the ileum distinctly hyperaemic, and in that portion of
it nearest the ileo-caecal valve, including the valve itself, the
inflammation had evidently been the most intense, since in this portion
the hyperaemia and thickening of the mucous membrane were most marked.In 16 cases the surface of the ileum appeared nearly or quite normal;
in 14 hyperaemia in the small intestines in patches, streaks, or
arborescence was recorded, but the records do not state in which
division of the intestines they were observed.Billard, with other observers, has noticed the frequency and intensity
of the inflammatory lesions in entero-colitis in the terminal portion
of the small intestines, and the thickening in many cases of the
ileo-caecal valve, and he asks whether the vomiting which is so common
and often obstinate in this disease may not be sometimes due to
obstruction to the passage of fecal matter at the valve in consequence
of the hyperaemia and swelling, but has not observed any retained fecal
matter above it, such as we find in any part of the colon, or any other
appearance which indicated sufficient obstruction to cause symptoms.Still, it seems not improbable that the reason why the inflammatory
lesions are more pronounced at and immediately above the valve than in
other parts of the small intestine is that the fecal matter, so
commonly acid and irritating in this disease, is somewhat delayed in
its passage downward at this point.Small superficial circular or oval ulcers were observed in the ileum in
4 cases, in 2 of which they were found also in the lower part of the
jejunum.In 1 case the records state that ulcers were in the jejunum,
but do not mention whether they were also in the ileum.In 1 case, in
which there was much thickening of the ileum next to the ileo-caecal
valve, many small granulations had sprouted up from the submucous
connective tissue, so that the mucous surface appeared as if studded
with small warts.Softening of the mucous membrane was also apparent in certain cases.The firmness of its attachment to the parts underneath varied
considerably in different specimens.I was able in cases in which there
was considerable softening to detach readily the mucous membrane with
the nail or handle of the scalpel within so short a period after death
that it was probable that the change of consistence was not cadaveric.In some cases the vessels of the submucous tissue were injected and
this tissue infiltrated.In all the cases except one lesions were present indicating
inflammation {738} of the mucous membrane of the colon.In 39
hyperaemia, thickening, and other signs of inflammation extended over
nearly or quite the entire colon; in 14 the colitis was confined to the
descending portion entirely or almost entirely; in 28 cases the records
state that inflammatory lesions were found in the colon, but their
exact location is not mentioned.In 18 of the autopsies the mucous
membrane of the colon was found ulcerated.Therefore, according to these statistics--and autopsies which I have
witnessed that are not embraced in them disclosed similar
lesions--colitis is present, almost without exception, in cases of
summer diarrhoea, associated with more or less ileitis.The portion of
the colon which presents the most marked inflammatory lesions is that
in and immediately above the sigmoid flexure--that portion, therefore,
in which any fermenting fecal matter has reached its greatest degree of
fermentation, and consequently contains the most irritating elements,
and where, next to the caput coli, it is longest delayed in its passage
downward.The solitary glands of both the large and small intestines and Peyer's
patches undergo hyperplasia.In cases of short duration, and in parts
of the intestine where the inflammatory action has been mild, the
solitary glands present a vascular appearance, like the surrounding
membrane, and are slightly enlarged.The enlargement is most apparent
if the intestine be viewed by transmitted light, when not only are the
glands seen to be swollen, but their central dark points are distinct.If a higher grade of intestinal catarrh or a catarrh more protracted
have occurred, the volume of these follicles is so increased that they
rise above the common level and present a papillary appearance.Peyer's
patches are also distinct and punctate.The enlargement of Peyer's
patches, like that of the solitary glands, is due to hyperplasia, the
elementary cells being largely increased in number.The small ulcers which, as we have seen from the above statistics, are
present in a certain proportion of cases in the mucous membrane of the
colon, and more rarely in that of the small intestine when the
inflammation has been protracted and of a severe type, appear to occur
in the solitary glands and in the mucous membrane surrounding them.While some of these glands in a specimen are simply tumefied, others
are slightly ulcerated, and others still nearly or quite destroyed.The
ulcers are usually from one to three lines in diameter, circular or
oval, with edges slightly raised from infiltration.Rarely, I have seen
minute coagula of blood in one or more ulcers, and I have also observed
ulcers which have evidently been larger and have partially healed.The
ulcers are more frequently found in the descending colon than in other
portions of the intestines.When ulcers are present they commonly occur
in the descending colon, or if occurring elsewhere they are most
abundant in this situation.According to my observations, these ulcers are found chiefly in infants
over the age of six months--during the time, therefore, when there is
greatest functional activity and most rapid development of the solitary
glands.Peyer's patches, though frequently prominent and distinct, have
not been ulcerated in any of the cases observed by me.The appendix vermiformis participates in the catarrh when it occurs in
the caput coli, its mucous membrane being hyperaemic and thickened.In
{739} certain rare cases the inflammation is so intense that a thin
film of fibrin is exuded in places upon the surface of the colon.It is
apt to be overlooked or to be washed away in the examination.The
rectum usually presents no inflammatory lesions, or but slight lesions
in comparison with those in the colon.It usually remains of the normal
pale color, or but slightly vascular even when there is almost general
colitis.Hence the infrequency of tenesmus.As might be expected from the nature of the disease, the secretion of
mucus from the intestinal surface is augmented.It is often seen
forming a layer upon the intestinal surface, and it appears in the
stools mixed with epithelial cells and sometimes with blood and pus.The mesenteric glands in cases which have run the most protracted
course and end fatally are found more or less enlarged from
hyperplasia.They are frequently as large as a pea or larger, and of a
light color, the color being due not only to the hyperplasia, but in
part to the anaemia.Occasionally, when patients have been much reduced
from the long continuance of the diarrhoea, and are in a state of
marked cachexia at death, we find certain of these glands caseous.The condition of the stomach is interesting, since indigestion and
vomiting are so commonly present.I have records of its appearance in
59 cases, in 42 of which it seemed normal, having the usual pale color
and exhibiting only such changes as occur in the cadaver.In the
remaining 17 cases the stomach was more or less hyperaemic, and in 3 of
them points of ulceration were observed in the mucous membrane.All physicians familiar with this disease have remarked the frequency
of stomatitis.In protracted and grave cases it is a common
complication.The buccal surface in these cases is more vascular than
natural, and if the vital powers are much reduced superficial
ulcerations are not infrequent, oftener upon the gums than elsewhere.The gums are apt to be spongy, more or less swollen, bleeding readily
when rubbed or pressed upon.Thrush is a common complication of the
summer complaint in infants under the age of three or four months, but
is infrequent in older infants.Occurring in those over the age of six
or eight months, it has an unfavorable prognostic significance,
indicating a form of summer diarrhoea which commonly eventuates in
death.The belief has long been prevalent in the past that the liver is also
in fault.The green color of the stools was supposed to be due to
vitiated bile.But usually in the post-mortem examinations which I have
made I have found that the green coloration of the fecal matter did not
appear at the point where the bile enters the intestines, but at some
point below the ductus communis choledochus in the jejunum or ileum.The green tinge, at first slight, becomes more and more distinct on
tracing it downward in the intestine.It appears to be due to admixture
of the intestinal secretions with the fecal matter.I have notes of the appearance and state of the liver in 32 fatal
cases.Nothing could be seen in these examinations which indicated any
anatomical change in this organ that could be attributed to the
diarrhoeal malady.The size and weight of the liver varied considerably
in infants of the same age, but probably there was no greater
difference than usually obtains among glandular organs in a state of
health.The following was the weight of this organ in 20 cases: {740}

    Age.4 weeks   5     ounces.| 10 months   6-3/4 ounces.2 months  3-1/2   "      | 13   "      6       "

  4   "     5       "      | 15   "      6       "
  5   "     6-1/2   "      | 15   "      7-1/2   "
  5   "     9       "      | 15   "      9-1/2   "
  7   "     4-1/2   "      | 16   "      6       "
  7   "     6       "      | 19   "      4-1/2   "
  7   "     6-1/4   "      | 20   "      9-1/4   "
  9   "     8       "      | 23   "     15       "

In none of these cases did the size, weight, or appearance of this
organ seem to be different from that in health or in other diseases,
except in one in which fatty degeneration had occurred, but this was
probably due to tuberculosis, which was also present.In most of these
cases the liver was examined microscopically, and the only noteworthy
appearance observed was the variable amount of oil-globules in the
hepatic cells.In some specimens the oil-globules were in excess, in
others deficient, and in others still they were more abundant in one
part of the organ than in another.Little importance was attached to
these differences in the quantity of oily matter.Hypostatic congestion of the posterior portions of the lungs, ending if
it continue in a form of subacute catarrhal pneumonia and giving rise
to an occasional painless cough, has been described in the preceding
pages.The character of the cough in connection with the wasting might
excite suspicions of the presence of tubercles in the lungs; but
tubercles are rare in this disease, and when present I should suspect a
strong hereditary predisposition.They occurred in only 1 of the 82
cases.The state of the encephalon in those patients in whom spurious
hydrocephalus occurs is interesting.In protracted cases of the
diarrhoea the brain wastes like the body and limbs.In the young
infant, in whom the cranial bones are still ununited, the occipital and
sometimes the frontal bones become depressed and overlapped by the
parietal, the depression being of course proportionate to the
diminution in size of the encephalon.In older children, with the cranial bones consolidated, serous effusion
occurs according to the degree of waste, thus preserving the size of
the encephalon.The effusion is chiefly external to the brain, lying
over the convolutions from the base to the vertex.Its quantity varies
from one or two drachms to an ounce or more.Along with this serous
effusion, and antedating it, passive congestion of the cerebral veins
and sinuses is also present.This congestion is the obvious and
necessary result of the feebleness of the heart's action and the loss
of brain substance.DIAGNOSIS.--The occurrence and continuance of diarrhoea in the warm
months, without any apparent cause except the agencies which hot
weather produces, indicate this disease.The exciting cause of the
attack may be the use of some indigestible and irritating substance,
dietetic or medicinal, as fruits with their seeds or a purgative
medicine; but if it continue after the immediate effects of the agent
have passed off, it is proper to attribute the diarrhoea to the summer
season.In the adult abdominal tenderness is an important diagnostic symptom of
intestinal catarrh, but in the infant this symptom is lacking or is not
in general appreciable, so that it does not aid in diagnosis.When the
{741} diagnosis of the disease is established, the symptoms do not
usually indicate what part of the intestinal surface is chiefly
involved, but it may be assumed that it is the lower part of the ileum
and the colon.The presence of mucus or of mucus tinged with blood in
the stools shows the predominance of colitis.PROGNOSIS.--Although this disease every summer largely increases the
death-rate of young children, most cases can be cured if the proper
hygienic and medicinal measures be early applied.It is obvious, from
what has been stated in the foregoing pages, that cholera infantum is
the form of this malady which involves greatest danger.Except in such
cases there is sufficient forewarning of a fatal result, for if death
occur it is after a lingering sickness, with fluctuations and gradual
loss of flesh and strength.Patients often recover from a state of
great prostration and emaciation, provided that no fatal complications
arise.The eyes may be sunken, the skin lie in folds from the wasting,
the strength may be so exhausted that any other than the recumbent
position is impossible, and yet the patient may recover by removal to
the country, by change of weather, or by the use of better diet and
remedies.Therefore an absolutely unfavorable prognosis should not be
made except in cases that are complicated or that border on collapse.The most dangerous symptoms, except those which indicate commencing or
actual collapse, arise from the state of the brain.Rolling the head,
squinting, feeble action or permanent contraction of the pupils,
spasmodic or irregular movements of the limbs, indicate the near
approach of death, as do also coldness of face and extremities and
inability to swallow.It is obvious also that in making the prognosis
in ordinary cases we should consider the age of the patient, the state
of the weather, the time in the summer, whether in the beginning or
near its close, and the surroundings, especially in reference to the
impurity of the air, as well as the patient's condition.Cholera Infantum, or Choleriform Diarrhoea.This is the most severe form of the summer complaint.It receives the
name which designates it from the violence of its symptoms, which
closely resemble those of Asiatic cholera.It is, however, quite
distinct from that disease.It is characterized by frequent stools,
vomiting, great elevation of temperature, and rapid and great
emaciation and loss of strength.It commonly occurs under the age of
two years.It sometimes begins abruptly, the previous health having
been good; in other cases it is preceded by the ordinary form of summer
diarrhoea.The stools have been thinner than natural and somewhat more
frequent, but not such as to excite alarm, when suddenly they become
more frequent and watery, and the parents are surprised and frightened
by the rapid sinking and real danger of the infant.The first evacuations, unless there have been previous diarrhoea, may
contain fecal matter, but subsequently they are so thin that they soak
into the diaper like urine, and in some cases they scarcely produce
more of a stain than does this secretion.Their odor is peculiar--not
fecal, but musty and offensive, and occasionally almost odorless.Commencing simultaneously with the watery evacuations or soon after is
another {742} symptom, irritability of the stomach, which increases
greatly the prostration and danger.Whatever drinks are swallowed by
the infant are rejected immediately or after a few moments, or retching
may occur without vomiting.The appetite is lost and the thirst is
intense.Cold water is taken with avidity, and if the infant nurse it
eagerly seizes the breast in order to relieve the thirst.The tongue is
moist at first, and clean or covered with a light fur, pulse
accelerated, respiration either natural or somewhat increased in
frequency, and the surface warm, but the temperature is speedily
reduced in severe cases.The internal temperature or that of the blood
is always very high.In ordinary cases of cholera infantum the
thermometer introduced into the rectum rises to or above 105 degrees,
and I have seen it indicate 107 degrees.Although the infant may be
restless at first, it does not appear to have any abdominal pain or
tenderness.The restlessness is apparently due to thirst or to that
unpleasant sensation which the sick feel when the vital powers are
rapidly reduced.The urine is scanty in proportion to the gravity of
the attack, as it ordinarily is when the stools are frequent and
watery.The emaciation and loss of strength are more rapid than in any other
disease which I can recall to mind, unless in Asiatic cholera.In a few
hours the parents scarcely recognize in the changed and melancholy
aspect of the infant any resemblance to the features which it exhibited
a day or two before.The eyes are sunken, the eyelids and lips are
permanently open from the feeble contractile power of the muscles which
close them, while the loss of the fluids from the tissues and the
emaciation are such that the bony angles become more prominent and the
skin in places lies in folds.As the disease approaches a fatal termination, which often occurs in
two or three days, the infant remains quiet, not disturbed even by the
flies which alight upon its face.The limbs and face become cool, the
eyes bleared, pupils contracted, and the urine scanty or suppressed.In
some instances, when the patient is near death, the respiration becomes
accelerated, either from the effect of the disease upon the respiratory
centres or from pulmonary congestion resulting from the feeble
circulation.As the vital powers fail the pulse becomes progressively
more feeble, the surface has a clammy coldness, the contracted pupils
no longer respond to light, and the stupor deepens, from which it is
impossible to arouse the infant.In the most favorable cases cholera infantum is checked before the
occurrence of these grave symptoms, and often in cases which are
ultimately fatal there is not such a speedy termination of the malady
as is indicated in the above description.The choleriform diarrhoea
abates and the case becomes one of ordinary summer complaint.ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS.--Rilliet and Barthez, who of foreign writers
treat of cholera infantum at greatest length, describe it under the
name of gastro-intestinal choleriform catarrh."The perusal," they
remark, "of anatomico-pathological descriptions, and especially the
study of the facts, show that the gastro-intestinal tube in subjects
who succumb to this disease may be in four different states: (_a_)
either the stomach is softened without any lesion of the digestive
tube; (_b_) or the stomach is softened at the same time that the mucous
membrane of the intestine, and especially its follicular apparatus, is
diseased; (_c_) or the stomach is healthy, {743} while the follicular
apparatus or the mucous membrane is diseased; (_d_) or, finally, the
gastro-intestinal tube is not the seat of any lesion appreciable to our
senses in the present state of our knowledge, or it presents lesions so
insignificant that they are not sufficient to explain the gravity of
the symptoms."So far, the disease resembles all the catarrhs, but what is special is
the abundance of serous secretion and the disturbance of the great
sympathetic nerve."The serous secretion, which appears to be produced by a perspiration
(analogous to that of the respiratory passages and of the skin) rather
than by a follicular secretion, shows, perhaps, that the elimination of
substances is effected by other organs than the follicles; perhaps,
also, we ought to see a proof that the materials to eliminate are not
the same as in simple catarrh.Upon all these points we are constrained
to remain in doubt.We content ourselves with pointing out the
fact."[2]

[Footnote 2: _Maladies des Enfants_.]On the 1st of August, 1861, I made the autopsy of an infant sixteen
months old who died of cholera infantum with a sickness of less than
one day.Nothing
unusual was observed in the brain, unless perhaps a little more than
the ordinary injection of vessels at the vertex.No marked anatomical
change was observed in the stomach and intestines, except enlargement
of the patches of Peyer as well as of the solitary and mesenteric
glands.In this and the following cases there was
apparently slight softening of the intestinal mucous membrane, but
whether it was pathological or cadaveric was uncertain, as the weather
was very warm.Examined by the microscope, it
was found to contain about the normal number of oil-globules.The second case was that of an infant seven months old, wet-nursed, who
died July 26, 1862, after a sickness also of about one day.He was
previously emaciated, but without any marked ailment.The post-mortem
examination was made on the 28th.The brain was somewhat softer than
natural, but otherwise healthy.There was no abnormal vascularity of
the membranes of the brain, and no serous effusion within the cranium.The mucous membrane of the intestines had nearly the normal color
throughout, but it seemed somewhat thickened and softened; the solitary
glands of the colon were prominent.The patches of Peyer were not
distinct.In the New York Protestant Episcopal Orphan Asylum an infant twenty
months old, previously healthy, was seized with cholera infantum on the
25th of June, 1864.The alvine evacuations, as is usual with this
disease, were frequent and watery, and attended by obstinate vomiting.Death occurred in slight spasms in thirty-six hours.The exciting cause
was probably the use of a few currants which were eaten in a cake the
day before, some of which fruit was contained in the first evacuations.The only pathological changes which were
observed in the stomach and intestines were slightly vascular patches
in the small intestines and an unusual prominence of the solitary
glands in the colon.The glands resembled small beads imbedded in the
mucous membrane.The lungs in the above cases were healthy, excepting
hypostatic congestion.{744} Since the date of these autopsies I have made others in cases
which terminated fatally after a brief duration, and have uniformly
found similar lesions--namely, the gastro-intestinal surface either
without vascularity or scantily vascular in streaks or patches,
sometimes presenting a whitish or soggy appearance and somewhat
softened, while the solitary glands were enlarged so as to be prominent
upon the surface.In cases which continue longer evident inflammatory
lesions soon appear which are identical with those which have already
been described in our remarks on the ordinary form of the summer
diarrhoea.During my term of service in the New York Foundling Asylum in the
summer of 1884, an infant died after a brief illness with all the
symptoms of cholera infantum, and the intestines were sent to William
H. Welch, now of Johns Hopkins Hospital, for microscopic examination.His report was as follows: "I found undoubted evidence of acute
inflammation.There was an increased number of small, round cells
(leucocytes) in the mucous and submucous coats.This accumulation of
new cells was most abundant in and around the solitary follicles, which
were greatly swollen.Clumps of lymphoid cells were found extending
even a little into the muscular coat.The epithelial lining of the
intestine was not demonstrable, but this is usually the case with
post-mortem specimens of human intestine, and justifies no inferences
as to pathological changes.The glands of Lieberkuhn were rich in the
so-called goblet-cells, and some of the glands were distended with
mucus and desquamated epithelium, so as to present sometimes the
appearance of little cysts.This was observed especially in the
neighborhood of the solitary follicles.The blood-vessels, especially
the veins of the submucous coat, were abnormally distended with blood.I searched for micro-organisms, and found them in abundance upon the
free surface of the intestine in the mucous accumulations there, and
also in the mouths of the glands of Lieberkuhn.Both rod-shaped and
small round bacteria were found.I attach no especial importance to
finding bacteria upon the surface of the intestine.The general result
of the examination is to confirm the view that cholera infantum is
characterized by an acute intestinal inflammation."NATURE.--Cholera infantum appears from its symptoms and lesions to be
the most severe form of intestinal catarrh to which infants are liable.The alvine discharges, to which the rapid prostration is largely due,
probably consist in part of intestinal secretions and in part of serum
which has transuded from the capillaries of the intestines.That the
intestinal mucous membrane sometimes presents a pale appearance at the
autopsy of an infant who, previously well, has died of cholera infantum
after a sickness of twenty-four or forty-eight hours, is perhaps due to
the great amount of liquid secretion and transudation in which the
inflamed surface is bathed.Moreover, it is, I believe, a recognized
fact that the hyperaemia of an acutely-inflamed surface when of short
duration frequently disappears in the cadaver, as that of scarlet fever
and erysipelas.The early hyperplasia of the solitary and mesenteric
glands, and the hyperaemia and thickening of the surface of the ileum
and colon in those who have survived a few days, indicate the
inflammatory character of the malady.The opinion has been expressed by certain observers that cholera {745}
infantum is identical with thermic fever or sunstroke.There is indeed
a resemblance to thermic fever as regards certain important symptoms.In cholera infantum the temperature is from 105 degrees to 108 degrees;
in sunstroke it is also very high, often running above 108 degrees.Great heat of head, contracted pupils, thin fecal evacuations,
embarrassed respiration, scanty urine, and cerebral symptoms are common
toward the close of cholera infantum, and they are the prominent
symptoms in sunstroke.Nevertheless, I cannot accept the theory which
regards these maladies as identical, and which removes cholera infantum
from the list of intestinal diseases.In cholera infantum the
gastro-intestinal symptoms always take the precedence, and are, except
in advanced cases, always more prominent than other symptoms.It does
not commence as by a stroke like coup de soleil, but it comes on more
gradually, though rapidly, and it often supervenes upon a diarrhoea or
some error of diet.In the commencement of cholera infantum the infant
is not apt to be drowsy, and it is often wide awake and restless from
the thirst.Contrast this with the alarming stupor of sunstroke.Sunstroke only occurs during the hours of excessive heat, but cholera
infantum may occur at any hour or in any day during the hot weather,
provided that there be sufficient dietetic cause.Again, intestinal
inflammation is not common in sunstroke, while it is the common or, as
I believe, the essential lesion of cholera infantum.These facts show,
in my opinion, that the two maladies are essentially and entirely
distinct.Nevertheless, cases of apparent sunstroke sometimes occur in
the infant, and if the bowels are at the same time relaxed the disease
is apt to be regarded as cholera infantum, and if fatal is usually
reported as such to the health authorities.Cases of this kind I have
occasionally observed or they have been reported to me, although they
are not common.With the exception of the organs of digestion no uniform lesions are
observed in any of the viscera in cholera infantum, except such as are
due to change in the quantity and fluidity of the blood and its
circulation.Writers describe an anaemic appearance of the thoracic and
abdominal viscera, and occasionally passive congestion of the cerebral
vessels.The cerebral symptoms often present toward the close of life
in unfavorable cases of cholera infantum are often due to spurious
hydrocephalus, which we have described above; but as the urinary
secretion is scanty or suppressed, cerebral symptoms may in certain
cases be due to uraemia.DIAGNOSIS.--This form of the summer diarrhoea is diagnosticated by the
symptoms, and especially by the frequency and character of the stools.The stools have already been described as frequent, often passed with
considerable force, deficient in fecal matter, and thin, so as to soak
into the diaper almost like urine.The vomiting, thirst, rapid sinking,
and emaciation serve to distinguish cholera infantum from other
diarrhoeal maladies.When Asiatic cholera is prevalent the differential diagnosis between
the two is difficult if not impossible.PROGNOSIS.--Cholera infantum is one of those diseases in regard to
which physicians often injure their reputation by not giving sufficient
notice of the danger, or even by expressing a favorable opinion when
the case soon after ends fatally.A favorable prognosis should seldom
be expressed without qualification.If the urgent symptoms be relieved,
{746} still the disease may continue as an ordinary intestinal
inflammation, which in hot weather is formidable and often fatal.If
the stools become more consistent and less frequent without the
occurrence of cerebral symptoms, while the limbs are warm and the pulse
good, we may confidently express the opinion that there is no present
danger.The duration of true cholera infantum is short.It either ends fatally,
or it begins soon to abate and ceases, or it continues, and is not to
be distinguished in its subsequent course from an attack of summer
diarrhoea beginning in the ordinary manner.TREATMENT.--Preventive Measures.--Obviously, efficient preventive
measures consist in the removal of infants so far as practicable from
the operation of the causes which produce the disease.Weaning just
before or in the hot weather should, if possible, be avoided, and
removal to the country should be recommended, especially for those who
are deprived of the breast-milk during the age when such nutriment is
required.If for any reason it is necessary to employ artificial
feeding for infants under the age of ten months, that food should
obviously be used which most closely resembles human milk in
digestibility and in nutritive properties.Care should be taken to
prevent fermentation in the food before its use, since much harm is
done by the employment of milk or other food in which fermentative
changes have occurred and which occur quickly in dietetic mixtures in
the hot months.It is also very important that the infant receive its food in proper
quantity and at proper intervals, for if the mother or nurse in her
anxiety to have it thrive feed it too often or in too large quantity,
the surplus food which it cannot digest if not vomited undergoes
fermentation, and consequently becomes irritating to the
gastro-intestinal surface.The physician should be able to give advice
not only in reference to the frequency of feeding, but also in regard
to the quantity of food which the infant requires at each feeding.Correct knowledge and advice in this matter aid in the prevention and
cure of the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Chadbourne of this city and myself made some observations in order to
ascertain how much food well-nourished infants receive daily.We
selected infants that had an abundance of breast-milk, and weighed them
before and after each nursing, so as to determine how much each infant
took during twenty-four hours.The avoirdupois ounce contains 437.5
grains, and we ascertained by careful weight and measurement, employing
the metric system for its greater accuracy, that one fluidounce of
human milk, with a specific gravity of 1.031, weighed 451.9 grains.With these data it was easy to determine the quantity of milk in
fluidounces from its weight.Our first observations related to 12
infants under the age of five weeks, 8 of which nursed twelve times,
and the remaining 4 eight, nine, nine, and eleven times respectively,
in the twenty-four hours.The quantity of milk received by them in
twenty-four hours varied considerably in the different cases, but the
average was 12.41 fluidounces.Therefore if a baby in the first five
weeks nurse every two hours, it receives only a little more than one
fluidounce at each nursing.The next observations were made upon 15 infants between the ages of
five weeks and ten months: 8 of the 15 were under the age of six {747}
months, and the remaining 7 were between the ages of six months and ten
months.The weighing showed that the younger took nearly the same
quantity per day, on the average, as the older infants in this group.The average quantity received by each was twenty-four and six-tenths
fluidounces.Hence if the nursings were eight in the twenty-four hours,
three ounces were taken at each nursing; if the nursings were twelve,
the quantity each time was two ounces.Biedert of Germany has also made similar observations in order to
determine the amount of nutriment required by infants.The results of
his weight-studies, as he designates them, were published in the
_Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde_, xix.B., 3 H. His weighing showed that
infants during their first month, if fed on cow's milk, required from
160 to 200 grammes of milk daily, and in the third month 300 grammes.These quantities in fluid measure are 5.44 to 6.83 ounces, the quantity
required each day in the first month, and 10.22 ounces, the quantity
required daily the second month.Therefore, both my weights and
Biedert's show that infants under the age of two months assimilate a
smaller quantity of milk than is usually supposed.For infants older
than two months he estimates the quantity of milk required by infants
by their weight.He believes that the greater the weight the greater is
the amount of food which the infant needs.The method pursued by
Chadbourne and myself is more simple, and it seems to indicate with
sufficient exactness the amount of food required.Some infants, like adults, need more food than others, so that there
can be no exact schedule of the quantity which they require at each
feeding; but while in the first and second months they do not need more
than from one to one and a half fluidounces at each feeding, whether of
breast-milk, or of cow's milk prepared so as to resemble as closely as
possible human milk, infants as they grow older and their stomachs
enlarge can take food in larger quantity, and therefore require less
frequent feeding.Under the age of two months the stomach is so small
that it cannot receive much more than one or one and a half fluidounces
without undue distension.At the age of six months it can probably
receive and digest without discomfort three ounces, and in the last
half of the first year even four ounces.Infants nourished at the
breast should be allowed to nurse every two hours in the daytime,
whatever the age, after the second month, but less frequently at night,
for frequent nursing promotes the secretion of milk, and the milk is of
better quality than when it is long retained in the breast.If by the
fifth or sixth month mothers or wet-nurses find, as is frequently the
case, that they do not have sufficient milk, other food should be given
in addition, perhaps after each second nursing or every fourth hour.The kind of food which it is best to employ to supplement the nursing
will be mentioned under the head of curative measures.By knowledge on
the part of the mother and nurse of the dietetic needs of the infant,
and by consequent judicious alimentation, and by measures also to
procure the utmost purity of the air, there can be no doubt that the
summer diarrhoea may to a great extent be prevented.Curative Treatment.--The indications for treatment are--1st, to provide
the best possible food; 2d, to procure pure air; 3d, to aid the
digestive function of the infant; 4th, to employ such medicinal agents
as can be safely given to check the diarrhoea and cure the intestinal
catarrh.{748} The infant with this disease is thirsty, and is therefore apt to
take more nutriment in the liquid form than it requires for its
sustenance.If nursing, it craves the breast, or if weaned, craves the
bottle, at short intervals to relieve the thirst.No more nutriment
should be allowed than is required for nutrition, for the reason stated
above, and the thirst may best be relieved by a little cold water,
gum-water, or barley-water, to which a few drops of brandy or whiskey
are added.Since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea is the use of improper food, it is obviously very important
for the successful treatment of this disease that the food should be of
the right kind, properly prepared, and given in proper quantity.I need
not repeat that for infants under the age of one year no food is so
suitable as breast-milk, and one affected with the diarrhoea and
remaining in the city should, if possible, at least if under the age of
ten months, be provided with breast-milk.It can be more satisfactorily
treated and the chances of its recovery are much greater if it be
nourished with human milk than by any other kind of diet.If, however,
the mother's milk fail or become unsuitable from ill-health or
pregnancy, and on account of family circumstances a wet-nurse cannot be
procured, the important and difficult duty devolves upon the physician
of deciding how the infant should be fed.In order to solve this
problem it will be well to recall to mind the part performed in the
digestive function by the different secretions which digest food:

1st.It converts starch into glucose
or grape-sugar.It has no effect upon fat or the protein group.It is
the secretion of the parotid, submaxillary, and sublingual glands,
which in infants under the age of three months are very small, almost
rudimentary.The two parotid glands at the age of one month weigh only
thirty-four grains.The power to convert starch into sugar possessed by
saliva is due to a ferment which it contains called ptyalin.The gastric juice is a thin, nearly transparent, and colorless
fluid, acid from the presence of a little hydrochloric acid.It
produces no change in starch, grape-sugar, or the fats, except that it
dissolves the covering of the fat-cells.Its function is to convert the
proteids into peptone, which is effected by its active principle,
termed pepsin.The bile is alkaline and neutralizes the acid product of gastric
digestion.It forms soaps with the
fatty acids and has a slight emulsifying action on fat.The soaps are
said to promote the emulsion of fat.Their emulsifying power is
believed to be increased by admixture with the pancreatic secretion.Moreover, the absorption of oil is facilitated by the presence of bile
upon the surface through which it passes.The pancreatic juice appears to have the function of digesting
whatever alimentary substance has escaped digestion by the saliva,
gastric juice, and bile.It is a clear, viscid liquid of alkaline
reaction.It converts proteids
into peptones and emulsifies fats.While the gastric juice requires an
acid medium for the performance of its digestive function, the
pancreatic juice requires one that is alkaline.This important fact
should be borne in mind, that such a mistake as presenting pepsin with
chalk mixture, or the extractum pancreatis with dilute muriatic acid,
may be avoided.The intestinal secretions are mainly from the crypts of
Lieberkuhn, and their action in the digestive process is probably
comparatively unimportant, but in some animals they have been found to
digest starch.It will be observed that of all these secretions that
which digests the largest number of nutritive principles is the
pancreatic.It digests all those which are essential to the maintenance
of life except fat, and it aids the bile in emulsifying fat.One of the most important conferences in paediatrics ever held convened
at Salzburg in 1881 for the purpose of considering the diet of infants.Among those who participated in the discussion were men known
throughout the world as authorities in children's diseases, such as
Demme, Biedert, Gerhardt, Henoch, Steffen, Thomas, and Soltmann.None
of the physicians present dissented from the following proposition of
the chairman: That "all the advances made in physiology in respect to
the digestive organs of children only go to prove that the mother's
milk is the only true material which is quantitatively and
qualitatively suited to the development of the child, which preserves
the physiological functions of the organs of digestion, and under
favorable circumstances of growth unfolds the whole organism in its
completeness."All agreed that when the breast-milk fails animal milk
is the best substitute.Henoch, who was one of the conference,
expresses the same opinion in his well-known treatise on diseases of
children, as follows: "Cow's milk is the best substitute for mother's
milk during the entire period of infancy.I consider the administration
of other substances advisable only when good cow's milk cannot be
obtained or when it gives rise to constant vomiting and diarrhoea."The many infants' foods contained in the shops were considered by the
conference, and, in the words of the chairman, "Now and evermore it is
unanimously agreed that these preparations can in no way be substituted
for mother's milk, and as exclusive food during the first year are to
be entirely and completely rejected."But, unfortunately, we soon learn
by experience that animal milk, although it is the best of the
substitutes for human milk, is, especially as dispensed in the cities,
faulty.It is digested with difficulty by young infants, and is apt to
cause in them diarrhoea and intestinal catarrh.Therefore in the hot
months its use is very apt to act as one of the dietetic causes of the
summer diarrhoea in infants exclusively fed upon it, unless it be
specially prepared so as to more closely resemble human milk.The
frequent unsatisfactory results of its use have led to the preparation
of the many proprietary substitutes for human milk which the shops
contain, and which have been so summarily discarded by the German
conference.Woman's milk in health is always alkaline.It has a specific gravity of
1.0317; cow's milk has a specific gravity of 1.029.That of cows
stabled and fed upon other fodder than hay or grass is usually
decidedly acid.That from cows in the country with good pasturage is
said to be alkaline, but in two dairies in Central New York a hundred
miles apart, in midsummer, with an abundant pasturage, two competent
persons whom I requested to make the examinations found the milk
slightly acid immediately after the milking in all the cows.The following results of a large number of analyses of woman's and
cow's milk, made by Konig and quoted by Leeds, and of several of the
{750} best known and most used preparations designed by their inventors
to be substitutes for human milk, show how far these substitutes
resemble the natural aliment in their chemical characters:

It is seen by examination of the analyses of the above foods that all
except such as consist largely or wholly of cow's milk differ widely
from human milk in their composition, and although some of them--as the
Liebig preparations, in which starch is converted into glucose by the
action of the diastase of malt--may aid in the nutrition and be useful
as adjuncts to milk, physicians of experience and close observation
will, I think, agree with the German conference that when breast-milk
fails or is insufficient our main reliance for the successful nutrition
of the infant must be on animal milk.Nestle's Food, which consists of
wheat flour, the yelk of egg, condensed milk, and sugar, and which has
been so largely used in this country and in Europe, is probably
beneficial mainly from the large amount of Swiss condensed milk which
it contains.Although the preference is to be given to animal milk over any other
kind of food as a substitute for human milk, yet even when obtained
fresh and from the best dairies and properly diluted it is very apt to
disagree with infants under the age of one year, producing indigestion
and diarrhoea.The close resemblance in chemical character of cow's,
ass's, and goat's milk to human milk would lead us to expect that
either would be a good substitute for the latter.The fact that the
milk of these animals is apt to cause indigestion and intestinal
catarrh, especially in the hot months, when the digestive function of
the infant is enfeebled from the heat, must be due to the quality
rather than quantity of its constituents.The difference in quality of
the casein of human and animal milk is well known, since that of human
milk coagulates in the stomach in flakes, and that of animal milk in
firm and large masses.The German conference saw at once the importance
of the problem which confronted them--_i.e._ how to modify cow's milk
so that it bears the closest possible resemblance to human milk.They
even discussed the difference of the milk of different breeds of cows,
and the proper feeding and care of cows, but the most important
suggestion made--and one which has already produced good results in
this country and in Europe, and promises to be instrumental in saving
the lives of many infants who by the old method of feeding would
inevitably perish--was made by Pfeiffer of Wiesbaden.I allude to the
peptonizing of milk.The pancreatic secretion digests milk that is
rendered alkaline at a temperature between 100 degrees and 150 degrees
F. Milk thus treated becomes in from twenty minutes to one hour
thinner, resembling human milk in appearance, and if the peptonizing be
continued beyond a certain point, and is more complete, its taste is
decidedly {752} bitter.The process should be watched and the
peptonizing suspended as soon as the bitterness becomes appreciable,
for, although more advanced peptonizing so changes the milk that it is
more easily digested by the infant than when the peptonizing is
partial, yet the bitterness which is imparted to it renders it very
disagreeable as a dietetic preparation.Milk thus prepared closely
resembles human milk in appearance, and its casein is so digested that
it is either not precipitated by acids or is precipitated, like that of
human milk, in flakes.By this process a digested or an easily-digested
casein is produced, instead of the casein of ordinary cow's milk, which
produces large and firm masses in the stomach--masses that the
digestive ferments penetrate with such difficulty that they cause
indigestion, and occur in the stools in coagula of greater or less
size.Pfeiffer pointed out that when peptonized milk is employed "the
feces showed absolutely no trace of the white cheesiness."Milk thus
prepared quickly spoils, and it is necessary to peptonize it in small
quantity and often during the twenty-four hours.In New York City during the last year peptonized milk has been employed
largely as recommended by Pfeiffer, and with such results as to
encourage its further use.It is now used in the New York Infant Asylum
and New York Foundling Asylum.Five grains of extractum pancreatis
(Fairchild & Co.'s) and ten grains of sodium bicarbonate are added to
one gill of warm water.This is mixed with one pint of warm milk, and
the mixture, in some convenient vessel, is placed in water kept at a
temperature of 100 degrees F. for one hour, when it is placed upon ice
to prevent further digestion.It should be tasted frequently during the
peptonizing process, and if the least bitterness be observed the
process should be suspended before the expiration of the hour.With
some specimens of milk, especially at a temperature of 115 degrees to
120 degrees, a half hour or even less is sufficient.This artificial
digestion is arrested either by boiling the peptonized milk, which
destroys the ferment, or by reducing its temperature to near the
freezing-point, which renders it latent and inactive, but does not
destroy it.I need not add that placing the peptonized milk on ice is
preferable to boiling it, since we wish the ferment to continue to act
in the stomach of the infant.In the present state of our knowledge of
infant feeding, therefore, we can recommend no better substitute for
human milk than peptonized cow's milk.Leeds recommended the following formula for peptonizing milk in his
very instructive remarks made before the New York County Medical
Association, July 16, 1884.In order that no mistake might be made, I
wrote to him for his formula, which he kindly sent me.The following is
an extract from his letter: "The formula which I ventured to suggest
for the preparation of humanized cow's milk was as follows: 1 gill of
cow's milk, fresh and unskimmed; 1 gill of water; 2 tablespoonfuls of
rich cream; 200 grains of milk-sugar; 1-1/2 grains of extractum
pancreatis; 4 grains of sodium bicarbonate.Put this in a
nursing-bottle; place the bottle in water made so warm that the whole
hand cannot be held in it without pain longer than one minute.Keep the
milk at this temperature for exactly twenty minutes.The milk should be
prepared just before using."The object is of course to provide from cow's milk a food which will be
the nearest possible approximation to healthy human milk; and this
{753} appears to be achieved by the peptonizing process.Certainly,
what physicians have long been desiring--namely, some mode of preparing
cow's milk so that its casein will coagulate in flakes like that of
human milk--has been obtained by peptonizing.It is a common error to expect too much of a new remedy which has a
real value, and we must not expect that all patients not in an utterly
hopeless state will begin to improve as soon as peptonized milk is
prepared for them, or that it is a full and exact substitute for human
milk, so that wet-nurses may be dispensed with.Healthy human milk is
the best of all food for infants under the age of twelve months, and
should always be preferred when it can be obtained, but we claim that
peptonized milk is a most useful addition to the dietetic preparations
for infants, probably surpassing in value the best of those in the
shops.We employ it in the belief that it affords important aid in
curing the dyspeptic and diarrhoeal maladies of infancy.Who first
formulated and recommended the process of peptonizing milk I am not
able to state, but I am informed that Roberts of Great Britain called
attention to it as a means of improving milk at a time antedating the
German conference.Milk from healthy, properly-fed cows may be prepared without
peptonizing, so as to agree with many infants except in the warmest
weather, but is obviously less easily digested than peptonized milk.It
should be diluted as follows with water boiled so as to free it from
germs: In the first week after birth one-fourth milk with the addition
of a little sugar.The milk should be gradually increased, so that it
is one-third by the end of the fourth week, one-half by the end of the
third month, and two-thirds to three-fourths by the end of the sixth
month.After the sixth month it is still proper to add one-fourth
water, but pure milk may be given.Before peptonizing--which, as we have seen, digests the casein to a
great extent, and changes that which is not digested so that it
coagulates in flakes in the stomach like breast-milk--was resorted to,
it was customary to use a thin barley- or oat-water in place of the
water used for diluting the milk.One heaped teaspoonful of barley
flour to two tablespoonfuls of water make a gruel of proper
consistence.A little farinaceous substance added to the milk by
mechanically separating the particles of casein tends to prevent their
coagulation in large and firm masses.This was the theory which
explained the beneficial action of the admixture.If for any reason
peptonized milk be not employed, milk prepared in the way I have
mentioned, by admixture with a farinaceous substance, is probably the
next best substitute for human milk.It is very important to determine when and how farinaceous foods shall
be given in this disease.It is well known that infants under the age
of three months digest starch with difficulty and only in small
quantity, since the salivary and pancreatic glands which secrete the
ferments which digest starch are almost rudimentary at that age.The
artificial digestion of starch is, however, easily accomplished.Among
the last labors of the renowned chemist Baron Liebig was the
preparation of a food for infants in which the starch is digested and
transformed into grape-sugar, and thus infants at any age who are fed
with it are relieved of the burden of digesting it.The baron led the
way which has been so successfully followed since in the artificial
digestion of foods.A considerable part of the starch {754} in wheat
flour is converted into grape-sugar by the prolonged action of heat.I
frequently recommend that from three to five pounds of wheat flour be
packed dry in a firm muslin bag, so as to form a ball, and be placed in
water sufficient to cover it constantly and the bag kept over the fire
three or four days.During the nights the fire may go out for a few
hours.At the expiration of this time the external part, which is wet,
being peeled off, the remainder resembles a lump of yellowish chalk.The flour grated from it gives a decided reaction of sugar by Fehling's
test.Starch is also quickly transformed into glucose by the action of
the diastase of malt, which indeed Liebig employed.If to a gruel of
barley flour, oatmeal, or other farinaceous substance, when hot, a
little of a good preparation of extract of malt, such as that prepared
by Trommer & Co.at Fremont, Ohio, which acts promptly, or by Reed &
Carnrick, be added, it becomes thinner.It is claimed that the starch
is thus quickly converted into glucose; which seems doubtful.It is,
however, so modified that it is apparently more readily digested and
assimilated.Farinaceous substances thus prepared may be employed with
peptonized or other milk.Infants frequently do better with this
admixture than when either the milk or gruel is used separately.Of the foods contained in the shops which have been most prescribed,
and which have apparently been useful in certain cases, I may mention
those which have been prepared according to Liebig's formula, of which
there are several, the analyses of which I have given, and Nestle's
farina.In the use of those foods which contain no milk, as Ridge's
food, Imperial granum, etc., it is recommended that milk be added,
while for such as contain condensed milk, as Nestle's and the
Anglo-Swiss food, only water should be employed.The Anglo-Swiss food
contains about 60 per cent.each
of oatmeal and Russian wheat flour.It gives an acid reaction, unlike
Nestle's, which is alkaline.When Biedert's cream conserve was
announced great expectations were awakened from the fact that the
inventor is an authority in paediatrics, but, unfortunately, they have
not been realized in this country.Much of Biedert's conserve when it
reaches us is spoiled, and the directions for its use are too
complicated for ordinary family use, since a different mixture is
required for each month of the infant's age.I have employed this food,
but, with Henoch, "could not convince myself that it is more
efficacious than cow's milk."I am informed that the sale of it in this
country has ceased.Condensed milk is largely used in the feeding of infants.The milk is
condensed in vacuo to one-third or one-fifth its volume, heated to 100
degrees C.to kill any fungus which it contains, and
38 to 40 per cent.of cane-sugar is added to preserve it.In the first
month one part of milk should be added to sixteen of water, and the
proportion of water should be gradually reduced as the infant becomes
older.The large amount of sugar which condensed milk, preserved in
cans, contains renders it unsuitable in the dietetic role of the summer
diarrhoea of infants.The sugar is apt to produce acid fermentation and
diarrhoea in hot weather.Borden's condensed milk, freshly prepared, as
dispensed from the wagons, contains, I am informed by the agent, no
cane-sugar or other foreign substance, and on this account is to be
preferred to that in the cans.It is cow's milk of good quality, from
which 75 to 79 per cent.of the water {755} has been removed under
vacuum.The sole advantage which it possesses--and it is an important
one--is that it resists fermentation longer than the ordinary milk.To select the best food for the infant from this considerable number of
dietetic preparations is one of the most important duties of the
physician.If called to an infant unfortunately deprived of wholesome
breast-milk, and suffering in consequence from indigestion and
diarrhoea, what diet shall we recommend?My recommendation would be as
follows: Use cow's milk of the best possible quality and peptonized in
the manner stated above, and peptonized in small quantity at a time,
such as a pint, or, better, half a pint.This may be the sole food till
the age of five or six months.Unfortunately, in the cities the milk
that is delivered in the morning is the milking of the preceding
evening, mixed with that of the preceding morning, brought often many
miles from the farms where it is produced.Milk twelve and twenty-four
hours old, notwithstanding the use of ice around the milk-cans, is apt
to undergo some fermentative change before it reaches the nursery.This
prevents the preparation of the best quality of peptonized milk, so
that in some instances during the heated term I have found that the
peptonized milk did not agree as well as the condensed milks, like
Borden's or Nestle's food.Not a few infants suffering from diarrhoeal
maladies seem to do better if some farinaceous food properly prepared
be added to the peptonized milk than when the milk is used alone.It is
better, I think, that the starch, or a considerable part of the starch,
be converted into glucose before the admixture.This can be done if a
few pounds of wheat flour be pressed dry in a bag, so as to form a
ball, and boiled three or four days, as I have elsewhere recommended.The flour grated from the mass gives a decided sugar reaction to
Fehling's test.For infants under the age of six months one
tablespoonful of the flour thus prepared should be mixed with twelve
tablespoonfuls of water and boiled.When it has been removed from the
fire and become tepid, a small quantity of a good extract of malt, as
Trommer's or Reed & Carnrick's, may advantageously be added to the
gruel to increase the transformation of starch and render it more
digestible.To avoid the time and trouble of preparing the food in this
manner, one of the foods contained in the shops, in which the starch
has been transformed into glucose by the employment of Baron Liebig's
formula, may be used, as Mellin's or Horlick's, instead of the wheat
flour prepared by long boiling.The older the child, the thicker should
be the gruel.Beef-, mutton-, or chicken-tea should not be employed, at least as it
is ordinarily made, since it is too laxative.Occasionally, for the
older infants, we may allow the expressed juice of beef, raw scraped
beef, or beef-tea prepared by adding half a pound of lean beef, finely
minced, to one pint of cold water, and after allowing it to stand for
half an hour warming it to a temperature not exceeding 110 degrees for
another half hour.Salt
should be added to it, and I am in the habit of adding to it also about
seven drops of dilute muriatic acid to facilitate its digestion.It is
chiefly for infants over the age of ten months that the meat-juices are
proper.A concentrated nutriment, prepared, it is stated, from beef,
mutton, and fruits, has lately been introduced in the shops under the
name Murdoch's Liquid Food.Young {756} infants with dyspeptic and
diarrhoeal symptoms can take it, and it appears to be readily
assimilated, as the quantity given at each feeding is small.It has its
advocates, and it appears to be of some service in cases of weak and
irritable stomach.But since one of the two important factors in producing the summer
diarrhoea of infants is foul air, it is obvious that measures should be
employed to render the atmosphere in which the infant lives as free as
possible from noxious effluvia.Cleanliness of the person, of the
bedding, and of the house in which the patient resides, the prompt
removal of all refuse animal or vegetable matter, whether within or
around the premises, and allowing the infant to remain a considerable
part of the day in shaded localities where the air is pure, as in the
parks or suburbs of the city, are important measures.In New York great
benefit has resulted from the floating hospital which every second day
during the heated term carries a thousand sick children from the
stifling air of the tenement-houses down the bay and out to the fresh
air of the ocean.But it is difficult to obtain an atmosphere that is entirely pure in a
large city with its many sources of insalubrity; and all physicians of
experience agree in the propriety of sending infants affected with the
summer diarrhoea to localities in the country which are free from
malaria and sparsely inhabited, in order that they may obtain the
benefits of a purer air.Many are the instances each summer in New York
City of infants removed to the country with intestinal inflammation,
with features haggard and shrunken, with limbs shrivelled and the skin
lying in folds, too weak to raise, or at least hold, their heads from
the pillow, vomiting nearly all the nutriment taken, stools frequent
and thin, resulting in great part from molecular disintegration of the
tissues--presenting, indeed, an appearance seldom observed in any other
disease except in the last stages of phthisis--and returning in late
autumn with the cheerfulness, vigor, and rotundity of health.The
localities usually preferred by the physicians of this city are the
elevated portions of New Jersey and Northern Pennsylvania, the
Highlands of the Hudson, the central and northern parts of New York
State, and Northern New England.Taken to a salubrious locality and
properly fed, the infant soon begins to improve if the disease be still
recent, unless it be exceptionally severe.If the disease have
continued several weeks at the time of the removal, little benefit may
be observed from the country residence until two or more weeks have
elapsed.An infant weakened and wasted by the summer diarrhoea, removed to a
cool locality in the country, should be warmly dressed and kept indoor
when the heavy night dew is falling.Patients sometimes become worse
from injudicious exposure of this kind, the intestinal catarrh from
which they are suffering being aggravated by taking cold, and perhaps
rendered dysenteric.Sometimes parents, not noticing the immediate improvement which they
have been led to expect, return to the city without giving the country
fair trial, and the life of the infant is then, as a rule, sacrificed.Returned to the foul air of the city while the weather is still warm,
it sinks rapidly from an aggravation of the malady.Occasionally, the
change from one rural locality to another, like the change from one
wet-nurse to another, has a salutary effect.The infant, although it
{757} has recovered, should not be brought back while the weather is
still warm.One attack of the disease does not diminish, but increases,
the liability to a second seizure.Medicinal Treatment.--The summer diarrhoea of infants requires, to some
extent, different treatment in its early and later stages.We have seen
that acids, especially the lactic and butyric, the results of faulty
digestion, are produced abundantly, causing acid stools.In a few days
the inflammatory irritation of the mucous follicles causes such an
exaggerated secretion of mucus which is alkaline that the acid is
nearly or quite neutralized.In the commencement of the attack these
acid and irritating products should be as quickly as possible
neutralized, while we endeavor to prevent their production by improving
the diet and assisting the digestion.In the second stage, when the
fecal matter is less acid and irritating from the large admixture of
mucus, medicines are required to improve digestion and check the
diarrhoea, while the indication for antacids is less urgent.Therefore
it is convenient to consider separately the treatment which is proper
in the commencement or first stage, and that which is required in the
subsequent course of the disease.First stage, or during the first three or four days, perhaps the first
week.--Occasionally, it is proper to commence the treatment by the
employment of some gentle purgative, especially when the disease begins
abruptly after the use of indigestible and irritating food.A single
dose of castor oil or syrup of rhubarb, or the two mixed, will remove
the irritating substance, and afterward opiates or the remedies
designed to control the disease can be more successfully employed.Ordinarily, such preliminary treatment is not required.Diarrhoea has
generally continued a few days when the physician is summoned, and no
irritating substance remains save the acid which is so abundantly
generated in the intestines in this disease, and which we have the
means of removing without purgation.The same general plan of medicinal treatment is appropriate for the
summer diarrhoea of infants as for diarrhoea from other causes; but the
acid fermentation commonly present indicates the need of antacids,
which should be employed in most of the mixtures used in the first
stage as long as the stools have a decidedly acid reaction.Those who accept the theory that this disease is produced by
micro-organisms which lodge on the gastro-intestinal surface and
produce diarrhoea by their irritating effect are naturally led to
employ antiseptic remedies.Guaita administered for this purpose sodium
benzoate.One drachm or a drachm and a half dissolved in three ounces
of water were administered in twenty-four hours with, it is stated,
good results.[3] I have no experience in the use of antiseptic
remedies.If by the appearance of the stools or the substance ejected from the
stomach, or by the usual test of litmus-paper, the presence of an acid
in an irritating quantity be ascertained or suspected, lime-water or a
little sodium bicarbonate may be added to the food.The creta
praeparata of the Pharmacopoeia administered every two hours, or, which
is more convenient, the mistura cretae, is a useful antacid for such a
case.By the alkalies alone,
aided by the judicious use of stimulants, the disease is sometimes
arrested, but, unless {758} circumstances are favorable and the case be
mild, other remedies are required.Opium has long been used, and it retains its place as one of the
important remedies in this disease.For the treatment of a young infant
paregoric is a convenient opiate preparation.For the age of one to two
months the dose is from three to five drops; for the age of six months,
twelve drops, repeated every three hours or at longer intervals
according to the state of the patient.After the age of six months the
stronger preparations of opium are more commonly used.The tinctura
opii deodorata or Squibb's liquor opii compositus may be given in doses
of one drop at the age of one year.Dover's powder in doses of
three-fourths of a grain, or the pulvis cretae comp.cum opio in
three-grain doses every third hour, may be given to an infant of one
year.Opium is, however, in general best given in mixtures which will be
mentioned hereafter.It quiets the action of the intestines and
diminishes the number of the evacuations.It is contraindicated or
should be used with caution if cerebral symptoms are present.Sometimes
in the commencement of the disease, when it begins abruptly from some
error in diet, with high temperature, drowsiness, twitching of the
limbs--symptoms which threaten eclampsia--opiates should be given
cautiously before free evacuations occur from the bowels and the
offending substance is expelled.Under such circumstances a few doses
of the bromide of potassium are preferable.In the advanced stage of
the disease also, when symptoms of spurious hydrocephalus occur, opium
should be withheld or cautiously administered, since it might tend to
increase the fatal stupor in which severe cases are apt to terminate.The vegetable astringents, although they have been largely employed in
the treatment of this as well as other forms of infantile diarrhoea,
are, I think, much less frequently prescribed than formerly.I have
entirely discarded them, since they are apt to be vomited and have not
proved efficient in my practice.As a substitute for them the
subnitrate of bismuth has come into use, and in much larger doses than
were formerly employed.While it aids in checking the diarrhoea, it is
an efficient antiemetic and antiseptic.It should be prescribed in ten
or twelve grains for an infant of twelve months; larger doses produce
no ill effect, for its action is almost entirely local and soothing to
the inflamed surface with which it comes in contact.It undergoes a
chemical change in the stomach and intestines, becoming black, being
converted into the bismuth sulphide, and it causes dark stools.Rarely
it gives rise in the infant to the well-known garlicky odor, like that
occasionally observed in adult patients, and which Squibb thinks may be
due to tellurium accidentally associated with the bismuth in its
natural state.For those cases in which the symptoms are chiefly due to
colitis, and the stools contain blood with a large proportion of mucus,
it has been customary to prescribe laudanum or some other form of opium
with castor oil.I prefer, however, the bismuth and opium for such
cases as are more decidedly dysenteric, as well as for cases of the
usual form of intestinal catarrh.In ordering bismuth in these large
doses it is important that a pure article be dispensed.The following are convenient and useful formulae for a child of one
year: {759}

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidrachm xiv.Shake thoroughly and give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.minim xvj;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Aq.cinnamomi,        fluidounce iss.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every two to four hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.X. Dose, one powder every three hours.drachm ij;
      Pulv.Cholera infantum requires similar treatment to that which is proper for
the ordinary form of the summer diarrhoea, but there is no disease,
unless it is pseudo-membranous croup, in which early and appropriate
treatment is more urgently required, since the tendency is to rapid
sinking and death.As early as possible, therefore, proper instructions
should be given in regard to the feeding, and for an infant between the
ages of eight and twelve months either one of the above prescriptions
should be given or the following:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Spts.fluidrachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidounce ss;
      Misturae cretae,      fluidounce iss.Give one teaspoonful every two or three hours.An infant of six months can take one-half the dose, and one of three or
four months one-third or one-fourth the dose, of either of the above
mixtures.If cerebral symptoms appear, as rolling the head, drowsiness, etc., I
usually write the prescription without the opiate; and with this
omission it may be given more frequently if the case require it, while
the opiate prescribed alone or with bromide of potassium is given
guardedly and at longer intervals.Although every day during the summer
months I have written the above prescriptions, it has been several
years since any case has occurred in my practice which led me to regret
the use of the opiate; but it must not be forgotten that there is
danger in the summer complaint, and especially in cholera infantum, of
the sudden supervention of stupor, amounting even to coma, and ending
fatally.A few instances have come to my knowledge in which, when death
occurred in this way, the friends believed that the melancholy result
was hastened by the medicine.But injury to the patient in this respect
can only occur, in my opinion, through carelessness in not giving
proper attention to his condition.It is chiefly in advanced cases,
when the vital powers are beginning to fail, when the innervation is
deficient, and the cerebral circulation sluggish, that the use of
opiates may involve danger.Explicit and positive directions should
{760} be given to omit the opiate or give it less frequently whenever
the evacuations are checked wholly or partially and signs of stupor
appear.Second Stage.--The summer complaint in a large proportion of cases
begins in such a gradual way that the treatment which we are about to
recommend is proper in many instances at the first visit of the
physician, who is frequently not summoned till the attack has continued
one or two weeks.The alkaline treatment recommended above for the
diarrhoea in its commencement does not aid digestion sufficiently to
justify its continuance as the main remedy after the first few days.In
a large number of instances, however, one of the above alkaline
mixtures may be given with advantage midway between the nursings or
feedings, while those remedies, presently to be mentioned, which
facilitate digestion and assimilation are given at the time of the
reception of food.Some physicians of large experience, as Henoch of Berlin, recommend
small doses of calomel, as the twelfth or twentieth of a grain, three
or four times daily for infants with faulty digestion and diarrhoea.To
me, this seems an uncertain remedy, without sufficient indications for
its use, and I have therefore no experience with it.The following are
formulae which I employ in my own practice, and which have been
employed with apparent good results in the institutions of New York:

  Rx.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.(Hawley's or other good pepsin), drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,                            fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                             fluidrachm xiv.M.

Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful before each feeding or nursing to an
infant of one year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.minim xvj;
      Acid.minim xvj;
      Pepsinae saccharat.drachm j;
      Bismuth.drachm ij;
      Syrupi,               fluidrachm ij;
      Aquae,                fluidrachm xiv.Shake bottle; give one teaspoonful every three hours to a child of one
year; half a teaspoonful to one of six months.drachm j-ij;
      Bismuth.One powder every three hours to a child of one
year; half a powder to one of six months.I have also obtained apparent benefit from lactopeptin, given as a
substitute for one of the above mixtures before each feeding or
nursing.In several instances which I recall to mind I have ordered as
much as could be placed on a ten-cent piece to be given every second or
third hour, while midway between the feedings in some instances of
considerable diarrhoea one of the mixtures of bismuth and chalk
recommended above was employed, and the result has been good.Enemata.--It will be recollected, from our remarks on the anatomical
characters, that inflammatory lesions are commonly present in the
entire length of the colon, and that at the sigmoid flexure, where acid
and irritating fecal matter is probably longest delayed in its passage
downward, the colitis is usually most severe.Aware of this fact, I was
{761} led to prescribe at my first visit a large clyster of warm water,
given with the fountain or Davidson's rubber syringe, especially in
cases in which the stools showed mucus or mucus tinged with blood.This, given with the lower part of the body raised a little above the
level of the shoulders, washes out the large intestine and has a
soothing effect upon its surface.The benzoate of sodium may be added
to the water for its antiseptic effect, as in the following formula:

  Rx.drachm j;
      Aquae,         pint j.  Misce.In occasional cases in which the stomach is very irritable, so that
medicines given by the mouth are in great part rejected, our reliance
must be largely on rectal medication, and especially on clysters
containing an opiate.Laudanum may be given in this manner with marked
benefit.It may be given mixed with a little starch-water, and the best
instrument for administering it is a small glass or gutta-percha
syringe, the nurse retaining the enema for a time by means of a
compress.Beck in his _Infant Therapeutics_ advises to give by the
clyster twice as much of the opiate as would be required by the mouth.A somewhat larger proportion may, however, be safely employed.The
following formula for a clyster has given me more satisfaction than any
other medicated enema which I have employed:

  Rx.iv;
      Bismuth.ss;
      Mucilag.acaciae,
      Aquae,         _aa_ fluidounce ij.One-quarter to one half of this should be given at a time, with the
addition of as much laudanum as is thought proper; and it should be
retained by the compress.It is especially useful when from the large
amount of mucus or mucus tinged with blood it is probable that the
descending colon is chiefly involved.Alcoholic stimulants are required almost from the commencement of the
disease, and they should be employed in all protracted cases.Whiskey
or brandy is the best of these stimulants, and it should be given in
small doses at intervals of two hours.I usually order three or four
drops for an infant of one month, and an additional drop or two drops
for each additional month.The stimulant is not only useful in
sustaining the vital powers, but it also aids in relieving the
irritability of the stomach and in preventing hypostasis in depending
portions of the lung and brain, which, as we have seen, is so frequent
in advanced cases.The vomiting which is so common a symptom in many cases greatly
increases the prostration, and should be immediately relieved if
possible.The following formulae will be found useful for it:

  Rx.drachm ij;
      Spts.fluidrachm ss-fluidrachm j;
      Syrupi,
      Aquae,          _aa_ fluidounce j.  Misce.Dose, one teaspoonful half-hourly or hourly if required,
made cold by a piece of ice.ij;
      Liquor.Dose, one teaspoonful, with a teaspoonful of milk (breast-milk if the
baby nurse), to be repeated according to the nausea.{762} Lime-water with an equal quantity of milk often relieves the
nausea when it is due to acids in the stomach, but it is rendered more
effectual in certain cases by the addition of carbolic acid, which
tends to check any fermentative process.Perhaps also some of the
recent antiseptic medicines introduced into our Pharmacopoeia, as the
benzoate of sodium, may be found useful for the vomiting.A minute dose
of tincture of ipecacuanha, as one-eighth of a drop in a teaspoonful of
ice-water, frequently repeated, has also been employed with alleged
benefit.Of these various antiemetics, my preference is for the bismuth in large
doses, with the aromatic spirits of ammonia, properly diluted, that the
ammonia do not irritate the stomach.Nevertheless, in certain patients
the nausea is very obstinate, and all these remedies fail.In such
cases absolute quiet of the infant on its back, the administration of
but little nutriment at a time, mustard over the epigastrium, and the
use of an occasional small piece of ice or the use of carbonic acid
water with ice in it, may relieve this symptom.In protracted cases, when the vital powers begin to fail, as indicated
by pallor, more or less emaciation, and loss of strength, the following
is the best tonic mixture with which I am acquainted.It aids in
restraining the diarrhoea, while it increases the appetite and
strength.It should not be prescribed until the inflammation has
assumed a subacute or chronic character:

  Rx.calumbae,     fluidrachm iij;
      Liq.ferri nitratis, minim xxvij;
      Syrupi,              fluidounce iij.Dose, one teaspoonful every three or four hours to an infant of one
year.{763}

PSEUDO-MEMBRANOUS ENTERITIS.BY PHILIP S. WALES, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Membranous enteritis; Infarctus (Kaempf); Diarrhoea

(Sennertus); Scelotyrbe pituitosa (Perywinger); Mucositas intestinalis
colloides, Concretiones gelatiniformes intestinales (Laboulbene);
Tubular exudation-casts of the intestines (Hutchinson).DEFINITION.--The disease is a non-febrile affection, consisting in a
peculiar, and usually persistent, morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous membrane, marked by the periodical formation of viscous,
shreddy, or tubular exudates composed chiefly of mucin, on the
discharge of which temporary amelioration of the accompanying acute
digestive and nervous symptoms occurs.HISTORY.--Although no distinct and separate accounts of
pseudo-membranous enteritis occur in the medical writings of the
ancients, nor even in those dating up to the eighteenth century, yet
there may occasionally be detected in some of the descriptions of
certain pathological conditions grouped under such titles as colic,
passage of gall-stones, tenesmus, coeliac and pituitous affections,
diarrhoea, dysentery, etc., the peculiar features of the disease under
consideration.This confusion ruled up to a comparatively recent time.J. Mason Good,[1] writing in the first quarter of the nineteenth
century, groups the disease as a species of diarrhoea--diarrhoea
tubularis--and remarks that he had "never hitherto seen this species
classified, and not often described, although it occurred frequently in
practice."[Footnote 1: _Study of Medicine_, 1822.]Aretaeus,[2] in the second century, in discussing the subject of
dysentery, speaks of alvine discharges sometimes occurring of a
substance of considerable length, in many respects not to be
distinguished from a sound piece of intestine, which he regarded as the
inner coating of the bowel.{764} This false interpretation of a fact
arose from the circumstance that the membranous exudate occasionally
assumes a tubular form, bearing the impress of the inner surface of the
bowel upon which it is formed, and was perpetuated up to a
comparatively recent period by successive authors.This error befell
Simpson,[3] Morgagni,[4] Lancisi, and Spindler;[5] the last of whom
describes the material discharged as worked up into a "materia alba,
longa, compacta."Bauer[6] under the title of "intestinal moles" describes in Haller's
_Disputations_ the discharges of this disease as "concreta fibrosa
quaedam pro parte pinguedine rara abducta, membranacea molarum ex utero
muliebri rejectarum formam accurate sistentia."[Footnote 6: "De Moles Intestinorum," _Disputationes ad Morborum_,
Dresdae, 1747, p.In the same volume Kaempf[7] discourses on this subject under the title
of "infarction of the intestinal vessels," and also in a separate
treatise[8] published somewhat later.In the latter he groups the
disease with others of a far different nature, their only point of
convergence being preternatural alvine discharges.[Footnote 7: _De Infarctu Vasorum Ventriculi_, Basiliae, 1751.][Footnote 8: _Abhandlungen von einer neuer methode der hartnackigsten
Krankheiten die ihren Sitz im unterleibe haben, zu heilen_, Leipzig,
1784.]Subsequent authors, as a rule, fell into the same error, and it was not
until 1818 that membranous enteritis was discriminated by Powell[9]
from that condition in which we recognize the presence of gall-stones.Since then more correct views have prevailed, and the disease has now a
recognized place in nosology.ETIOLOGY.--As in other diseases of obscure nature, so in this, there
has been much divergence of opinion as to its cause.The influence of age is striking, as it is rarely seen in childhood or
in persons who have passed the forty-fifth year.Of my own cases, the
youngest was forty, and the oldest fifty-four.Rilliet and Barthez[10]
state that membranous formations in the intestinal canal of children
are very rare; that they always occupy the summits of the folds, rarely
the intervals, of the mucous membrane; and that they are detached in
layers of greater or less extent.Heyfelder[11] has described similar exudations under the name of
enteritis exudatoria.[Footnote 10: _Traite clinique pratique des Maladies des Enfants_, t.
i. p.[Footnote 11: _Studien in Gabiete der Heilwissenschaft_, p.Sex exerts as marked an influence as age, as the immense preponderance
of cases occurs in females.In an analysis of 100 cases, 4 only
occurred in males, 2 of which were children.All of my cases were
women; with the exception of two cases occurring in males, the same
experience is reported by Powell and by Copeland.In regard to temperament, it is undoubted that the disease invades
nervous and hypochondriacal subjects oftener than others, but all
temperaments are liable in the presence of those enervative influences
that degrade physical health and impair nerve-power.All of my patients
belonged to the nervous type.Whitehead says that those of a phlegmatic
temperament, not easily excited into action, or persons deficient in
elasticity of fibre, compose all but a very small percentage of the
sufferers from this {765} complaint, and he had particularly noticed
that a large proportion of the women have light flaxen hair, fair
complexions, and white skins.The determinative causes, whatever they may be, occasion perversion of
nutrition and innervation of the gastro-intestinal canal, principally,
I believe, by their action upon the ganglionic nerves presiding over
those functions originating the peculiar exudatory phenomena of this
disease.This condition of the nervous system once established, local
irritation of any sort may precipitate an attack, and hence the
multitudinous influences that have been assigned as exercising a
causative agency, as exposure to wet and cold, coarse, bad food, fecal
impaction, and the abuse of cathartic medicines, as alleged by
Grantham,[12] who asserts that the use of mercury, conjoined with a too
frequent use of aperient agents, is the cause of the disease in every
case.[Footnote 12: _Facts and Observations in Med.and Surg._, 1849, p.Farr considered the irritation of the intestinal canal owing to a
parasitic growth of a confervoid type (oscillatoria).This view is
supported by no other authority than that of himself and Bennett, as
nothing of this sort is recorded as occurring in the discharges of
patients of other observers; certainly in mine there was no parasitic
development.The presence of it in their cases may then be fairly
regarded as accidental, or at least unessential.Habershon regarded ovarian diseases and painful menstruation in the
female, and prostatic diseases in the male, as exciting causes.SYMPTOMS.--The most characteristic symptoms disclosing the presence of
pseudo-membranous enteritis are those arising from derangements of the
digestive organs.They are, in the beginning, vague and irregular in
occurrence, or so over-veiled by associated disorders of the
genito-urinary and nervous systems that their nature and import often
escape recognition until, weeks, and even months, of fruitless
medication addressed to these secondary phenomena having been expended,
the disease assumes such severity and presents such a complex of
peculiar symptoms that it no longer eludes identification.The disease rarely starts as an acute affection; sometimes it is
subacute, but in the great majority of cases its course is chronic.Its
initiation is marked with symptoms of gastro-intestinal
disturbances--irregularity of the bowels, constipation and diarrhoea
alternately; and dyspeptic annoyance of one sort or another--capricious
appetite, nausea or vomiting, and pyrosis, usually increased by liquid
diet.In Dunhill's case there was almost daily vomiting of mucus and
pus streaked with blood, and occasionally pure blood.This prominence
of gastric derangement supplies an explanation why Todd conferred upon
the disease the title of follicular dyspepsia.There is a sense of discomfort, soreness, or rawness of the abdomen,
especially along the line of the colon, and in two of my cases the
rectum was tender and raw, which augmented to decided pain in sitting
or riding, and the abdominal muscles were tense; a feeling of heat or
burning in the bowels often occurs, and almost always more or less
lassitude and mental depression.These symptoms aggravate, especially
upon indiscretions in diet, exposure to wet, or indeed under any sort
of enervative influences, at irregular intervals.Their persistence
finally induces grave disorders of nutrition, marked by the blood
becoming poor and thin, by sluggish {766} circulation and local
congestions in the pelvic and abdominal viscera, and loss of strength
and flesh.Yet certain patients seem to retain their flesh for a long
time, as I have seen, after suffering several years from the disease.The depression of vital powers is still further manifested in a small,
slow, soft pulse and a temperature running below the normal standard.The tongue is usually moist, pale, and flabby, and coated with a
pearl-white or yellowish-white coating; sometimes, however, it is raw,
red, tender, and fissured, or patchy from exfoliation of the mucous
coating.The gums and cheeks are usually pale and bloodless, and often
the seat of small roundish painful ulcers, which occasionally invade
the palate and throat.Grantham[13] says that ulceration of a
phagedaenic kind sometimes forms on the tonsils.The complexion usually
assumes a muddy or flavescent tint, which during the attack may deepen
to a jaundiced hue.At other times it presents a transparent or waxy
appearance.The skin is dry and furfy, sometimes cold and clammy, or, from
over-action of the sebaceous glands, greasy.There is a disposition,
especially on the chest, neck, and face, to papular eruptions or even
phlegmonous or carbuncular inflammation.The urine is high- and loaded with abundant phosphates, which in
cooling precipitate as a heavy deposit.The bladder is often irritable,
and discharges more or less mucus.According to Grantham,[14] patients
occasionally pass urine with evident traces of albumen, and seldom
containing a normal quantity of phosphates.On an increase in fever or
mental excitement a larger quantity than natural of the lithate of
ammonium is found; frequently the mucous membrane of the bladder is
found thickened in these cases.The characteristic symptom, however, of this disease is the periodical
formation and discharge of mucous exudates varying in physical
appearances and frequency.The discharge may occur daily, with every
stool, or at irregular intervals--a week, month, or longer--but usually
in from twelve to fifteen days.The recurrence may be precipitated by
irregularity in diet, exposure to wet and cold, or by excesses of any
sort.The paroxysm is marked by tormina or severe pain, which may
resemble that of colic or that of the passage of a biliary calculus,
extending down the thighs or to the bladder, in the latter case
sometimes causing retention, requiring the use of the catheter.The
pain is usually referred to some part of the large intestine.In
certain cases the paroxysm is announced by chills radiating from some
point in the abdomen or even from other parts of the body.After the paroxysm has endured two, three, or more days--usually a
week--membranous exudates, either with a spontaneous or with an
artificial movement of the bowels, are voided; after which there is a
gradual assuagement of the local and general symptoms, but the patient
experiences a sense of exhaustion or lassitude, and the tenderness of
the abdomen and the irregularity of the bowels usually persist.During the attack there is anorexia, but in the intervals the appetite
remains fairly good, and the alvine discharges may assume quite a
natural condition.In the course of the disease there is more or less disturbance in the
functions of the nervous system.During the paroxysm, when the {767}
sufferings are severe, the cast of symptoms running through the case is
of a decidedly hypochondriacal type.At times, with the expulsion of
the exudates and succeeding respite from suffering, there often occurs
a mental rebound which lifts the patient from the slough of despair to
the most hopeful anticipations of future health and happiness.In one
of my cases this transition was remarkable.This hysterical type is
common enough, and the irritability of the nervous system is still
further manifested in the occurrence of irregular contractions of
various groups of the voluntary muscles, as shown in hysterical
tetanus, general convulsions, or chorea in children, or by paralyses of
motion.Copeland[15] reports a case of a lady in whom this disease was
complicated with the severest symptoms of hysteria, occasionally
amounting to catalepsy.The paroxysms of pain recurred at intervals
between four and six weeks, followed or attended by the discharge of
large quantities of false membrane in pieces, and sometimes in perfect
tubes.The menstrual flow was painful and irregular, accompanied with
shreds of false membrane--not, however, contemporaneous with those of
the intestine.The sensory nerves are often deranged, for in some cases
there is paraesthesia--anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia--in limited areas
of the skin.There is more or less headache, neuralgic pains in this or
that nerve, or in several at the same time.[Footnote 15: _Dictionary of Medicine_, vol.The special senses do not escape; they manifest various forms of
functional derangement.In one of my cases there were constant buzzing
in the ears and perversion of the sense of smell, and in another the
vision was thought impaired and the services of an oculist sought.The uterine functions are always involved in greater or less degree.The menstruation is difficult and painful, and occasionally accompanied
with membranous discharges.In one of my cases there was a uterine
exudate, though the menopause had occurred several years before.Leucorrhoea and cervical inflammation are common.PATHOLOGY.--Despite the fact that the disease in question, without
being very frequent, is far from rare, little light has been shed upon
its pathology.Indeed, even its individuality as an independent and
distinct affection has been contested, although it is marked by a
complex of symptoms as peculiar and characteristic as those of any
other disease in the nosology.There are those who maintain that the disease consists essentially in
an inflammatory condition of the intestinal mucous membrane, either of
the ordinary or of some specific type, croupous or diphtheritic.Copeland says the formation of the membranes depends upon a latent and
prolonged state of inflammation extending along a very large portion,
sometimes the greater part, of the intestinal canal, as is evinced by
the quantity thrown off.Valleix[16] dismisses the subject summarily
with the delivery of the oracular judgment that the greater number of
cases of this disease are dysenteric, and the remainder diphtheritic.Habershon is in full accord with this view, having, as he says, seen
these membranous exudates "follow severe disease of the intestines of a
dysenteric character, and sometimes associated with a state of chronic
congestion of the liver, and often perpetuated by the presence of
hemorrhoids, polypoid {768} growths, etc."Wilks and Clark,[17] after a
full examination of the enteric exudates submitted to them, concluded
that they are true casts of the large intestines produced by chronic
inflammatory action of the mucous membrane and subsequent exudation.Conjectures have been ventured as to the exact anatomical structure in
which the process occurs.Thus, Todd[18] says that the proximate cause
of the disease is dependent upon a morbid condition of the intestinal
mucous follicles.Golding-Bird[19] holds similar language.He says: "It
is probable that the follicles are the principal seat of the disease,
for we know that they sometimes secrete a dense mucus differing little
in physical qualities from coagulated albumen or even fibrin."Livedey[20] attributed the process to a morbid secretion into the
mucous crypts.[Footnote 16: _Guide du Medecine practicien_, vol.[Footnote 18: _Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine_, vol.[Footnote 19: _Guy's Hospital Reports_.][Footnote 20: _L'Union medicale_, 1868.]Among those believing in its croupous nature was Powell, who assumed
the character of the inflammation to be specific, and the exudate of
the same nature and formed in the same manner as that of ordinary
croup.This was the view entertained by Cruveilhier and Trousseau and
other French authors.Good was misled in a similar manner, as shown by
his statement that the exudation bears a striking resemblance to the
fibrous exudation thrown forth from the trachea in croup.He says,
however, that it is discharged in longer, firmer, and more compact
tubes.Serres,[21] in a dissertation upon pseudo-membranous colitis,
confounds the exudate with that of thrush, muguet, and infective
dysentery.Laboulbene,[22] a later writer, also remarks that there are
found in many treatises and in periodical literature a great number of
occurrences of false membranes in the dejecta.Most of these cases are
referable to dysentery, to muguet, hydatids, etc., but there remain a
certain number which are owing to different inflammatory and
non-diphtheritic affections of the digestive tube.[Footnote 21: _These de Paris_, No.[Footnote 22: _Recherches cliniques et anatomiques sur les Affections
pseudo-membraneuse_, Paris, 1861.]Whitehead, in summing up his conclusions respecting the nature of the
disease, compares it with dermic inflammation.He says: "The mucous
membrane (intestinal), like the skin (and is not the one looked upon as
an inversion of the other?), is prone under certain conditions in
certain constitutions to develop products unnatural to its functions.It is not natural for the skin to produce eczema, neither is it natural
for mucous surfaces to produce mucus in a concrete form; that the
proximate cause of the symptoms referable to this disease is the
hypersecretion and accumulation of mucus on the free surface of mucous
membranes; such accumulations sheathe and prevent the healthy
performance of the functions natural to the part, and thus induce
immediate and remote results, the effect of such suppressed functions;
that this hypersecretion indicates a want of balance between
nerve-force and germinal matter, and that the nerve-force is perverted
by irritation."Simpson held similar views, and regarded the disease as a chronic
pellicular or eruptive inflammation of the mucous lining of the
bowels.[23] Other observers have been inclined to ignore the
inflammatory nature of the disease, at least as a primary condition,
and have sought the proximate cause in some as yet undefined
derangement of the nervous {769} system.Thus, Clark does not regard
the membranous exudates as the products of inflammation, properly so
called--that is, of capillary blood-stasis which has preceded their
formation--as the characteristic of such exudates is that they contain
fibrin.He says the abnormal cell-forms present arise in some other way
than by free cell-development out of an exuded blastema.Good[24]
asserts its dependence upon what he calls a "peculiar irritability of
the villous membranes of the large intestines, which in consequence
secrete an effusion of coagulating fibrin--fibrin mixed with
albumen--instead of secreting mucus, occasionally accompanied with some
degree of chronic inflammation."[Footnote 24: _Study of Medicine_, _op.cit._]

Also, DaCosta doubts whether the disease is originally inflammatory at
all."Where inflammation," he says, "occurs, is it not secondary rather
than primary, the result rather than the cause?""Is not the true
trouble in the nervous system, in the nerves presiding over secretion
and nutrition in the abdominal viscera?"Bennett and Byford represent the opinions of a very small minority who
regard the disease as simply an expression of uterine derangement.MORBID ANATOMY.--As none of the cases coming under my observation
terminated fatally, no opportunity was offered to me of making personal
investigation into the anatomical changes occurring in membranous
enteritis.Such opportunities have been so rarely met with that,
indeed, it may be said that the nature of these changes is wholly
unknown.Simpson alludes to a case of phthisis in which the patient had passed
large quantities of "membranous crusts or tubes," and in which the
mucous membrane of the colon was covered with an immense number of
small spots of a clear white color, or vesicles, which, when punctured,
discharged a small quantity of clear fluid; and also refers to the case
of Wright, in which the mucous membrane of the colon and of the lower
portion of the small intestine was studded everywhere with a
thickly-set papular eruption.My endoscopic examinations revealed, in the living subject, the
intestinal mucous membrane of a red, verging into a scarlet color,
thickened, and denuded of epithelium in patches of varying extent.This
condition does not always invade the ampulla of the rectum, but with
the long tube I am in the habit of using it was possible in all my
cases to reach a point where it existed.The extent of diseased surface
can only be conjectured by an inspection of the exudates and by
abdominal palpation.In most cases the exudate is restricted to the large intestines--colon
and rectum--and often to a circumscribed portion of them; but in rare
cases its length and quantity would seem to indicate that extensive
portions of the surface are covered.One of the most remarkable cases
recorded is that of a woman forty years old who had been sick for five
years with gastro-intestinal derangement.Suddenly the case became
acute, and after much suffering she passed membranous exudates three
millimeters in thickness and many centimeters long, weighing in all
three kilograms.[25]

[Footnote 25: _Recueil de Memoires de Medecine, de Chirurgie, et de
Pharmacie militaires_, tome xxxvii.Kaempf[26] gives another case, in which the length of the membranes
{770} discharged was sevenfold greater than the stature of the patient.In Dunhill's[27] case the patient had suffered from this disease for a
long period, and during two years passed many yards of perfect
cylindrical shape, many of them several feet in length, and
sufficiently coherent to permit of their being handled, held up, etc.In one of my cases a perfect cylinder three-quarters of a yard long was
voided.Laboulbene[28] describes the gastro-intestinal false membrane as thin,
soft, and granular, of a more or less yellow color, slightly adherent
to the mucous membrane, and when stripped off forming a yellow
pultaceous mass.He says it is first deposited in small, irregular,
sparsely-scattered patches, located on the summits of the intestinal
folds; afterward these patches increase, and cover the folds entirely
and almost the whole calibre of the intestinal canal.The mucous
membrane, he remarks, beneath the deposit is greatly inflamed.Powell believes that at times the deposit extends as high as the
duodenum, his opinion being solely based upon the clinical features of
the disease.In the first of his cases the membrane was found in
perfect tubes, some of them full half a yard in length, and certainly
sufficient in quantity, he says, to have lined the whole intestinal
canal.In examining the membranes it is always best to float them from the
fecal or other foreign material by passing the discharges in a clean
vessel containing water.Their physical characters can then be readily
studied.They are best preserved in a 10 per cent.The exudate consists usually of a single lamina, but at various points
in certain cases several superposed laminae may be observed, enclosing
between them particles of undigested food of various kinds.In most
cases the superficial layers are more opaque, drier, less elastic, and
friable than the deeper.The configuration of the exudate varies greatly.The more common
variety is that occurring in loose, transparent, jelly-like masses,
like the white of an egg or glue, tinged often with various hues of
yellow.In three of my cases I noticed also the frequent occurrence of
a thin, serous, yellow discharge.In some cases the discharge resembles
pieces of macaroni, tallow, or wax; in others it assumes a shreddy or
ribbon-like form; and in a still rarer class it is tubular, being an
exact reprint of the surfaces from which detached.These tubular pieces
are, however, more or less torn and broken into smaller fragments of an
inch or two in length when discharged.Its thickness also varies: sometimes it does not exceed that of the
thinnest film, and at others it is a quarter of an inch or more.Its consistence ranges from that degree of loose aggregation that
permits elongation into stringy, breaking masses when fished up from
the water in which it floats, to a firmness and tenacity that will
enable it to be handled without fear of breakage.It is usually yellowish-white,
but this is often modified by tints dependent upon admixture with
extraneous matters from the intestinal canal--biliary coloring, blood
from the rupture of the vessels beneath the exudate, or with blood and
pus.The surfaces of the membranes are ordinarily smooth and uniform, but
sometimes reticulated.Certain observers have described the outer {771}
surface of the tubular exudate as uniformly smooth, and the inner as
broken and flaky at some points, at others ragged and flocculent, and
in many places thrown into shallow folds, lying in some situations
across, but chiefly along, the axis of the gut.The microscopic characters of the exudate are pretty uniform.Wilks and
Clark[29] describe the surface of the tubes, examined with a linear
magnifying power of forty diameters, as exhibiting the appearance of a
gelatinous membraniform matrix traversed by a coarse network of opaque
yellow lines, studded at their points of intersection by similarly
 rounded masses.From the larger network proceeds a smaller
secondary network, and in the recesses of this were found, at close and
regular intervals, well-defined round or oval openings, with elevated
margins, resembling in size and appearance the mouths of the follicles
of the great gut.With higher powers the exudate was found in many
cases to consist of a structureless basement membrane, which in certain
points showed a fibrous appearance, owing doubtless to the presence of
filaments of mucin.Numerous irregular granular cells, as well as
granules from the breaking up of these cells, thickly studded the
surface of the membrane.In the specimens of Wilks and Clark the
surface, besides being marked by the opaque yellow lines and dots,
presented various foreign matters, such as bile-pigment, earthy and
fatty granules, portions of husks of seed, gritty tissues of a pear, a
peculiar form of elastic tissue, stellate vegetable hairs, and a
mucedinous fungus.Clark, in describing the fibres found between the
layers of the exudates, says that they exhibited a very distinct and
regular transverse striation, approaching in character that found in
the ligamentum nuchae of the giraffe.Quekett and Brooke have met with
the same fibres in the feces.The transverse division depends probably
upon beginning decay.The division is sometimes so distinct and
complete as to lead, according to Beale,[30] to their confounding with
confervoid growths.Farre[31] actually describes the formation as of a
confervoid character.[Footnote 30: _The Microscope in Medicine_, p.Here and there, in my specimens, were observed scattered epithelial
cells which were occasionally gathered in patches.Small <DW52> masses
of irregular shape, doubtless of fecal origin, were also noticed.The
cells imbedded in the matrix, according to the above-quoted observers,
consisted of two kinds--one more or less spherical, the other more or
less cylindrical.In size the spherical cells varied from 1/2000 to
1/800 of an inch in diameter.The smaller cells had no distinct
cell-walls.Some of the larger cells were filled with fat-granules, and
represented granular cells; others had a single or double vesicular
nucleus; a few were acuminated at two opposite points and somewhat
compressed.All the other cells possessed demonstrable cell-walls.The
cylindrical cells resembled in their general characters those which
normally coat the mucous membrane of the larger gut, but they were much
more elongated, compressed, and firmly matted together.Many of the
more elongated cells were constricted in the middle, and exhibited a
nucleus on each side of the constriction.The more or less spherical
cells occupied the attached, and the cylindrical cells the free,
surface of the membranous tubes.The perforations in the matrix were of uniform size and appearance,
{772} surrounded by elevated margins formed of closely-grouped
cylindrical cells, and led to two kinds of pits--one short and
flask-shaped, the other long and uniformly cylindrical.The
flask-shaped pits were about one-tenth of an inch in diameter and
distinctly hollow.The wall of each pit was made up of one or two
layers of subspheroidal cells, held together by an amorphous stroma.A
few of these follicles contained a deposit which was opaque in situ,
and which when broken up was found to consist of large flattened
nuclear cells, analogous to those met with in epithelial growths.The cylindrical pits were also for the most part hollow, about
one-sixteenth of a line in length and one-thirty-first of a line in
breadth.These walls, devoid of membrane, were composed of small, more
or less spherical cells in various stages of development, imbedded in a
gelatinous matrix.In examining the chemical characters of the specimens obtained in my
cases the membranes were thoroughly washed, when they were nearly as
colorless as the water in which they floated.They were drained on a
sieve, and presented a gelatinous appearance, much like the white of an
egg.Their specific gravity was about that of distilled water.When
treated with strong alcohol, the membranes shrank and assumed a
striated appearance.Chemical tests of tincture of guaiacum, peroxide
of hydrogen, and others failed to show the presence of fibrin or
albumen.Treated with ether, globules of fatty matter were obtained,
which were identified by their microscopical characters and by their
reaction with osmic acid.By boiling the liquid in which the membranes
had been soaked it became faintly hazy, indicating a trace only of
albumen.Faint evidence of the presence of this body was also presented
by picric acid and Mehu's test.Treated with a weak solution of caustic
potassa and heat, the membrane dissolved, leaving a little haziness.The liquid was then filtered, and exactly neutralized with acetic acid,
and plumbic acetate added, when a copious precipitate was formed.Mercuric chloride and potassic ferrocyanide failed to produce this
effect.From these and other tests used the conclusion was reached that
these membranes were composed essentially of mucin.Both the microscopical and chemical characters of the exudates of the
disease under consideration show that they are widely different in
nature from those of other diseases.They are evidently a production of
the muciparous glands (follicles of Lieberkuhn) of the intestinal
canal, and consist essentially of mucin.Perroud[32] concluded from his
analysis that they contain a small quantity of albumen, but are
principally formed of the same substance as that which enters into the
composition of the epidermis.The exudates of other diseases of the
alimentary mucous membrane contain albumen and fibrin, as well as
molecular or homogeneous filaments.The ordinary croupous exudate,
according to Cornil and Ranvier, always contains filaments of fibrin,
sometimes mucin and pus-corpuscles mingled with the cellular
constituents, which vary in character with the locality of the
inflammation.The filaments form a reticulum in the meshes of which are
contained the other elements.[Footnote 32: _Journal de Medecine de Lyon_, 1864.]Diphtheritic exudates, as shown by Lehmann,[33] consist of fibrin, a
large {773} quantity of fatty matter, and 4 per cent.of earthy
phosphates, while its structure is made up of epithelial cells united
together, which, becoming infiltrated with an albuminous substance and
gradually losing their nuclei and walls, are finally converted into
homogeneous branching masses.The cells of these masses are liable to
undergo fibrinous degeneration.The inflammation determining the
exudate is not confined to the conglomerate glands, but involves all
the textural elements of the part affected, and the material of the
membrane originates from the capillary disturbance in them.[Footnote 33: _Lehrbuch der Physiolog.Chemie_, Leipzig, 1855.]Andrew Clark[34] states that he has observed in his studies of exuded
blastema, the product of diseased action in mucous membranes, three
varieties.The first is clear, jelly-like, and imperfectly membranous.The second is yellowish, semi-opaque, flaky, and usually membranous.The third is yellowish-white, dense, opaque, distinctly membranous,
tough, and rather firmly adherent to the subjacent surface.The first
contains only the merest trace of albumen, and no fibrin; the second
contains an abundance of albumen, and no fibrin; the third contains
both albumen and fibrin in abundance, the latter in a fibrillated form.Yet it is to be noticed that in
the first variety there is no evidence of transudation or exudation; in
the second, no evidence of a true exudation; and that in the third, in
which the existence of a true inflammatory exudation is undeniable, the
only additional structural element present is fibre.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of membranous enteritis can never in its
advance, and rarely in its early stages, present much difficulty.Its
chronic course, irregular exacerbations, lack of febrile excitement,
the persistent derangement of the intestinal canal, the mental
depression, the gradual impairment of health, the various visceral
complications, and, lastly and chiefly, the peculiar character of the
alvine discharges,--stamp the disease with an individuality entirely
its own.The mucous discharges of certain forms of chronic diarrhoea and the
membranous discharges of infective dysentery are all so different in
physical character, and are associated with such a different complex of
general symptoms, that they cannot be confounded with those of the
diseases in question.The peculiar irritative quickness of the pulse of
ordinary enteritis, according to Powell and Good, suffices to
differentiate this disease from membranous enteritis.The peculiarities
of the physical and chemical properties of these exudates, already
fully dwelt upon, not only distinguish them from those of the above
diseases, but also from such dejecta as may contain fragments of
undigested connective tissue, of hydatids, or of worms.The flakes of
mucus discharged from the bowels in protracted constipation, fissura
ani, and in the later stages of cirrhosis of the liver are composed of
mucus in which are found imbedded epithelial cells from the colon and
mucus-corpuscles.The microscope will also reveal the character of the
fatty discharges that may be associated with diseases of the pancreas,
liver, and duodenum.The mucous flakes of cholera stools are composed
of masses of intestinal epithelium mixed with amorphous and granular
matter, crystals of different substances, and, according to Davaine, of
parasitic forms, particularly the Circomonas hominis.{774} Membranous casts from the upper part of the digestive track are,
in rare cases, passed by the bowels.One of the most curious instances
of this sort is reported by Villerme:[35] A woman swallowed a
tablespoonful of nitric acid, and seventy days afterward a long
membranous exudate, one or two lines thick and of a brown color, was
discharged, which corresponded in form with the oesophagus and stomach.[Footnote 35: _Dictionnaire des Sciences medicales_, tome xxxii.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of the disease as regards life is not
unfavorable, but as regards permanent restoration to health and
strength the case is entirely different.Theden[36] and Hoffman[37]
have, however, stated that the disease is not an unfrequent cause of
sudden death.[Footnote 36: _Remarques et Experiences_, tome ii.]Abercrombie[38] records a case of death from phthisis complicated with
this disease, and Wright another case in which the patient died in an
extreme state of marasmus.The acute and subacute forms are more
amenable to treatment, and the chances are correspondingly greater of
permanent recovery, though in all cases there is a strong tendency to
relapse.The chronic forms may almost be enrolled among the opprobria
medicorum when once they have made deep inroads upon nutrition and the
vital powers, and produced that condition named by Todd the pituitous
cachexia (cachexia pituitosa).These cases may, however, be alleviated
by judicious treatment, diet, and climatic changes, but repeated
relapses may be expected as the rule under slight exciting causes or
even without apparent cause.Patients under these circumstances drag
out a life of valetudinarianism, but it may be cut short at any time by
the supervention of some intercurrent disease, as phthisis, renal
degeneration, etc., or, according to Grantham, atrophy of the
intestines.Broca[39] records two cases of this disease, one of which
lasted ten and the other fifteen years.Three of my cases have endured
over six years.[Footnote 39: _Bulletin de la Societe Anat.TREATMENT.--The treatment of membranous enteritis embraces medical and
hygienic measures.The medical means have for their object, first, the
removal of the membranous exudation when it has once formed; and,
second, to correct the conditions upon which its formation depends by
improving nutrition and invigorating the nervous system.The severe
sufferings of the paroxysms are greatly alleviated and the duration of
this stage cut short by freely emptying the bowels.The best means to
do this is by the injection of hot water with the long elastic bougie
three or four times a day, and to assist this with laxatives.Instead
of water, solutions of potassa, soda, and lime-water are preferred by
some practitioners.As a rule, the enemata cause considerable
discomfort, but in the end are followed by improvement in the condition
of the bowels.The best laxative is emulsion of castor oil, but
occasionally a mercurial, guarded by the extract of belladonna, will
furnish more marked relief.Powell and Copeland say that they have
employed with decided advantage a purgative consisting of the compound
infusion of gentian and infusion of senna, to which were added ten or
twenty minims of liquor potassae.This was repeated, so that four
stools in the twenty-four hours were obtained.Clark preferred to
regulate the bowels, when needed, with rhubarb, soda, and {775} ipecac,
conjoined or not, as required, with mercury and chalk.Good recommends
four grains of Plummer's pill every night, and the bowels kept open by
two drachms of sublimed sulphur daily.It should always be borne in
mind that all active or irritating purgatives are harmful.The bowels
by this treatment will not only be disembarrassed of the membranous
exudates, but also of any fecal collection the retention of which would
surely cause irritation, as occasionally happens even when there is an
apparent diarrhoea.This condition may be easily determined by
abdominal palpation.The relief from pain procured by free evacuation
of the intestine will be enhanced by the employment of hot fomentations
to the abdomen.Despite these means, its severity may, however, demand
the administration of narcotics.The best form will be a hypodermic
injection of a sixth or a quarter of a grain of morphia; enemata of
starch and laudanum are also beneficial.Burrows mentions a case in
which he succeeded in allaying nervous irritation by the nightly use of
thirty drops of laudanum.The patient noticed that the habitual
constipation was increased when the accustomed narcotic was omitted.Bromide of potassium in large doses long continued will also be found
useful for the same purpose.During the intervals of the paroxysms local medication of the bowels
and medical and hygienic measures should be had recourse to to prevent
the re-formation of the exudates by modifying the vital activities of
the intestinal mucous membrane and by restoring the general tone of the
constitutional powers.For local treatment the nitrate of silver,
sulphate of zinc, the sulphate of copper dissolved in glycerin, the
tincture of iodine, and carbolic acid cannot be over-prized.From five
to ten grains of the metallic salts, fifteen drops of tincture of
iodine, ten of the acid, administered through the long rubber tube, are
suitable doses to begin with.I am also in the habit of using stronger
solutions by mopping it on to the bowel through the endoscopic tube.Kaempf made frequent and large injections of decoctions of various
plants--saponaria, taraxacum, etc.--which he imagined possessed
dissolvent and resolvent virtues.Cumming[40] speaks highly of the
efficacy of electricity.Gazette_, 3d Series, vol.For the purpose of improving the general health the preparations of
iron are advisable, of which the best are the tincture of the chloride,
pernitrate, pyrophosphate, lactate, and potassio-tartrate.Habershon
advises infusions of the bitter tonics with hydrocyanic and
nitro-muriatic acid.I have found a combination of these acids with
henbane and infusion of serpentaria useful.I also employ hot solutions
of the latter acid as a local bath over the abdominal region, applied
with a large sponge.Clark speaks favorably of the extract of nux
vomica and astringent remedies.Simpson praises the oleo-resins under
the form of pitch pills and tar, while Clark and others laud copaiba
and turpentine.Good advises the copaiba to be given by enema when it
cannot be borne by the stomach.The alterative effects of small doses of arsenic, corrosive sublimate,
sulphate of copper, etc.Grantham in
the early stages of the complaint advises the use of ten grains of
iodide of potassium combined with one-quarter of a grain of morphia at
bed-time.He {776} also strongly urges the use of cod-liver oil, which,
he says, improves the strength and increases the flesh, lessens the
spasmodic pains, but does not check the discharges.Counter-irritation of the abdominal region with tincture of iodine, fly
blisters, mustard, etc.Dunhill
kept a blister open for six months without any good results.The mineral waters of Pyrmont, Harrogate, and Carlsbad have been found
serviceable; the latter, Henoch[41] says, should be preferred before
all.[Footnote 41: _Klinik der Unterleub.The case will amend more speedily and surely by the adoption of those
sanitary measures, as regards clothing, diet, bathing, exercise, and
change of climate, which have such important influences upon health.The healthy performance of the functions of the skin is of such
paramount necessity in maintaining that of the intestinal canal that
the patient should endeavor to avoid any exposure likely to lead to
checked perspiration, and should use flannel underwear and stimulate
the skin by friction with the hand or the flesh-brush.The diet should
be graded to the ability of the stomach to digest and the body to
assimilate.Our chief reliance will be upon milk, plain or peptonized,
eggs, and beef given in the various forms of acceptable preparations,
so as not to impair the tone of the stomach nor clog the appetite by
sameness.Such vegetables and fruits as agree with the patient may be
allowed.I have tried exclusive diets of milk, farinacea, and meat
without marked benefit.All stimulants, tea, and coffee should as a
rule be interdicted.Systematic exercise in the open air and change of climate to a cool,
dry, bracing atmosphere will contribute to comfortable existence, if
not lead to recovery.{777}

DYSENTERY.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.DEFINITION.--Dysentery is the clinical expression of a disease of the
large intestine, of specific and non-specific (catarrhal) origin and
form; characterized by hyperaemia, infiltration, and necrosis
(ulceration) of its mucous membrane; distinguished by discharges of
mucus, blood, pus, and tissue-debris; and attended with griping and
expulsive pains (tormina and tenesmus).ETYMOLOGY.--The name is compounded of the two Greek words [Greek: dys
enteron], which, though untranslatable literally into English, have
long since received the exact Latin equivalent, difficultas
intestinorum.With appropriate alteration the same name is still
employed in every civilized language in the common as well as the
classical description of the disease.The French synonym, colite,
locates the anatomical seat of the disease, while the German Ruhr and
the English flux express one of its cardinal symptoms, the frequency
(flow) of the evacuations.HISTORY.--Ancient.--In its clinical history dysentery is one of the
oldest known diseases, the name being found in common use before the
time of Hippocrates, as in the often-quoted passage from Herodotus (443
B.C.), who relates that it and the plague reduced the army of Xerxes on
the desert plains of Thessaly.Fayrer informs us that in the ancient system of Hindoo medicine of the
Ayur Veda, and in the commentaries of Dhanwantari, Charaka, and
Sussutra, which carry us back nearly three thousand years, and in later
Sanskrit writers, dysentery is described by the name of atisar, under
two forms--amapake, or acute, and pakistar, or chronic; these again are
subdivided into six varieties, ascribed by those ancient sages to
changes in air, bile, phlegm, food, or to perturbations of the emotions
and passions.makes frequent reference to the disease, the
nature of which he regards as a descent of the humors from the brain."Men of a phlegmatic temperament are liable to have dysenteries," he
says, "and women also, from the humidity of their bodies, the phlegm
descending downward from the brain.""The disease is caused," he says more exactly in another place, "by the
overflow of phlegm and bile to the veins of the belly, producing
ulceration and erosion of the intestine."In his country, at least, it
seemed most to prevail in spring, but it was clearly connected with the
heat and moisture of this season in Greece--prime factors everywhere in
the genesis of the disease: "For when suffocating heat sets in all of a
{778} sudden while the earth is moistened by the vernal showers and by
the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled from the earth, which
is thus soaked by the rain and heated by a burning sun, while at the
same time men's bellies are not in an orderly state, nor is the brain
properly dried."Of the prognosis he observes with great acumen,
"Dysenteries when they set in with fever... or with inflammation of
the liver and hypochondrium or of the stomach,... all these are bad.But such dysenteries as are of a beneficial nature and are attended
with blood and scrapings of the bowels cease on the seventh or
thirtieth day, or within that period.In such cases even a pregnant
woman may recover and not suffer abortion;" whereas, "dysentery if it
commence with black bile is mortal."Galen comments upon this statement
that such a discharge is as incurable as cancer.The practitioner of
our day will interpret this assertion, which was repeated with singular
unanimity by all the writers of antiquity, with the belief that the
black bile was blood, and that such cases really were cancers.Indeed,
Paulus AEgineta distinctly says, "Dysentery arising from black bile is
necessarily fatal, as indicating an ulcerated cancer."Thus, although dysentery is among the oldest of the known maladies, and
was recognized then as now by the same symptoms, the disease was by no
means closely defined or differentiated in ancient times.As Ackermann
long ago pointed out, many other affections were included under the
term dysentery, and some of the symptoms of true dysentery, notably the
tenesmus, were raised to the dignity of distinct diseases.The gravity of the so-called lotura carnea, the fleshy stools, was
fully appreciated by Hippocrates, as is evidenced by the remark that
"if in a person ill of dysentery substances resembling flesh be
discharged from the bowels, it is a mortal symptom."Fleshy masses,
[Greek: xysmata], scrapings of the guts (originally epidermic
exfoliations from the bodies of gladiators, used in pills as a tonic),
were frequently alluded to by the older writers, more especially by
Aretaeus, in description of the discharges of dysentery.Hippocrates
was also aware of the fact that dysentery may be a secondary as well as
a primary malady."One may expect," he says in speaking of the victims
of gangrene, "that such patients will be attacked with dysentery; for
dysentery usually supervenes in cases of mortification and of
hemorrhage from wounds."Finally, Hippocrates recognized the effects of
emesis in relief of the disease with the remark in one of his aphorisms
that a spontaneous vomiting cures dysentery.Celsus (25 B.C.-45 A.D.), the great encyclopaedist, whose works
"constitute the greatest literary monument since the days of
Hippocrates," compiles all the information obtained up to his time; but
it is plain as regards dysentery, though he defines it in terms that
might stand in a modern text-book, that he has nothing new to add to
the knowledge of the Hippocratic school.He named the disease from one
of its most prominent symptoms, tormina (tenesmus he considered a
separate affection), speaks of the stools as being mixed with mucus and
fleshy masses, and in its treatment especially enjoins rest, "as all
motion proves injurious to the ulcer."), of all the authors of antiquity, wrote the most
perfect and at the same time the most picturesque account of the morbid
anatomy and symptomatology of this disease.The gross appearance of the
ulcers in the intestine and the common character of the discharges he
{779} describes with the accuracy of the modern pathologist and the
ardor of the true clinician.He speaks of the superficial, the
deep-seated, the irritable, and the callous ulcer.There is, he says,
"another larger species of ulcers, with thick edges, rough, unequal,
callous, as we would call a knot of wood; these are difficult to cure,
for they do not readily cicatrize, and the cicatrices are easily
dissolved."Their tendency to arrest and renewal and their general and
local effects he notices at length."There may be a postponement of
their spreading for a long time," he says, "various changes taking
place in the ulcers, some subsiding and others swelling up like waves
in the sea.Such is the course of the ulcers; but if nature stand out
and the physician co-operate, the spreading may indeed be stopped, and
a fatal termination is not apprehended, but the intestines remain hard
and callous, and the recovery of such cases is protracted."Vivid
descriptions he gives of the stools: "Sometimes they are like chopped
tallow, sometimes merely mucus, prurient, small, round, pungent,
causing frequent dejections and a desire not without a pleasurable
sensation, but with very scanty evacuations."Again, they are "fetid
like a mortification;" composed of "food now undigested, as if only
masticated by voracious teeth,... the dejection being discharged with
much flatulence and noise; it has the appearance of being larger than
its actual amount."attempted to correct the pathology of his
contemporaries, who considered all bloody discharges dysenteric.There
are four distinct varieties of bloody stools, he claims, only one of
which, that due to ulceration of the intestine, deserves to be called
dysentery.The bilious stool he derived from melancholy, and the fleshy
stool from disease of the liver.But, though Galen regarded the
presence of blood as a necessity, he was well aware of the fact that
the stools contained ingredients other than blood.It was Galen who
first used the word scybala ([Greek: schybala], feces) to express the
small, solid masses of excrementitious matter often voided with the
stools.In his treatment of the disease he made much use of the various
drying earths, the Samian, Lemnian, Armenian, the sources of which he
made long journeys to visit in order to become better acquainted with
their properties, and which are better substituted in our day by
bismuth, chalk, magnesia, and the carbonate of iron.It is the
distinguished merit of Galen to have called special attention to the
anatomical seat of the disease.Ulceration of the intestine he claimed
as the very essence of the disease, and all the physicians of his day,
he maintained, regarded as dysenteric only such cases as are attended
with ulceration.Galen was the exponent of the flower of Grecian, we might say of
ancient, medicine.With very few exceptions, the later writers, if they
do not obscure the original text with their speculations, are content
to simply paraphrase the observations of their predecessors, and the
subsequent contributions to the ancient history of dysentery may be
briefly summed up in a few additional notes.Coelius Aurelianus (400 A.D.)adopted the humoralistic doctrine of
Hippocrates and regarded dysentery as an intestinal rheumatism
(catarrh) with ulceration.He seems to have been the first author to
recognize the cardinal fact that dysentery, notwithstanding the number
of its stools, should be classed with the diseases which constipate the
bowels, or, as it {780} was centuries later aptly put by Stoll, "ut
hanc morbis adnumeres alvum potius occludentibus," and he blames
Erasistratus for using nothing but astringents, whereas many cases of
dysentery require laxatives.It is worthy of note that Coelius
Aurelianus ascribes the first use of opium in the treatment of
dysentery to Diocles of Carystus (300 B.C.), who administered the juice
of poppies combined with galls.By the time of Galen opium was so
freely used in the treatment of the fluxes as to call for protest
against its abuse.Alexander of Tralles (575 A.D.)is often credited as having been the
first to locate the disease in the large intestine.The truth is, he
suggested various rules by which the seat of the disease, whether in
the small or large intestine, might be definitely determined.But none
of these rules--the seat of the pain, for instance, whether above or
below the umbilicus, and the interval of time between the pain and
discharges, whether long or short--possess the least diagnostic value
or add to the attempts in this direction of previous writers--Aretaeus,
Archigenes, and Galen.Like these, his predecessors, he recognized an
hepatic dysentery with discharges of bloody serum, which he attributed
with them to atony of the liver, but more boldly than they, and with
characteristic independence, he ventured to treat his patients with
fresh vegetables and fruits, damsons and grapes.Paul of AEgina (660 A.D.)locates the disease in the rectum, and gives
a graphic account of its symptomatology.He made the mistake of many
later practitioners in regarding as a separate disease a symptom,
tenesmus, which he describes as an irresistible desire of evacuation,
"discharging nothing but some bloody humor, which is the cause of the
whole complaint, being an oedematous inflammation of the rectum which
creates the impression of feces lodged in the intestine and a desire of
evacuation.""Dysentery," he continues, "is an ulceration of the
intestines, sometimes arising from the translation of tenesmus, and
sometimes being of itself the primary affection; and is attended with
evacuations at first bilious and of various colors, then accordingly
bloody, and at last ichorous, like that which runs from dead bodies."In curious contrast to these accurate observations is the absurd
suggestion of an obsolete therapy (Galen), that the dried dung of dogs
who had eaten bones, when drank in milk which has been curdled by
having heated pebbles put into it, is of great service; but as an
offset to this freak of fantasy is the renewed advocacy of warm milk,
fallen somewhat into disuse since the days of Hippocrates and Galen:
"And milk itself moderately boiled is an excellent thing"--a
recommendation of the milk diet which now plays such an important role
in the treatment of so many diseases of the alimentary canal.Modern.--From this brief survey it is seen that the writers of
antiquity left nothing in the symptomatology of dysentery for
subsequent authors to describe.All further advance in our knowledge of
this, as of all diseases, was now rendered impossible by the extinction
of the light of science in the long night of the Middle Ages, whose
gloom deepens with succeeding centuries and whose shadows fall close up
to our own times.The modern history of dysentery may be said to begin with Daniel
Sennertus, whose first _Tractatus de Dysenteria_ was published at {781}
Wittenberg in 1626.Sennert gave the deathblow to tenesmus as a
distinct disease, or as even a pathognomonic sign of dysentery, showing
that it is often present in purely local troubles, ulcers, fissures,
hemorrhoids, etc., or is due to disease of other organs--stone in the
bladder, tumors in the womb, etc.He recognized sporadic and epidemic
attacks of the disease, and described under the terms fiens and facta
forms which coarsely correspond to the catarrhal and diphtheritic
varieties of modern pathologists.Improper food, unripe fruits, at
least, cannot be the cause of dysentery, because, he shrewdly observes,
the epidemic of 1624 began in May, before the fruits were ripe, and
ceased in autumn, when they were ripe and in daily use.Moreover,
sucklings at the breast suffered with the disease.Nor could moisture
alone account for the disease, as this epidemic occurred after an
unusually hot and dry spring and early summer.Some other cause must be
invoked, and this other cause is perhaps the occult influence of the
constellations and planets--an explanation which he afterward admits to
be only an asylum of ignorance.In the treatment of the disease the
indication should be to heal the abraded or ulcerated intestine; but
since this cannot be done unless the cause is first removed, "the
abrading, eroding humor should be evacuated and absterged, at the same
time its acrimony mitigated and corrected; then the flux should be
checked by astringents, and the pain, if vehement, lenified and
removed."Purgatives should be repeated until all vicious humors are
discharged.Sydenham  his descriptions of the epidemic which he witnessed in
London in 1669-72 with the artistic touches of the master's hand."The
disease sets in," he says, "with chills and shivers.After these come
the heat of the fever, then gripings of the belly, and lastly stools.Occasionally there is no fever; in which case the gripes lead the way,
and the purging follows soon after.Great torment of the belly and
sinking of the intestines whenever motions are passed are constant; and
these motions are frequent as well as distressing, the bowels coming
down as they take place.They are always more slimy than stercoraceous,
feces being rarely present, and when present causing but little pain.With these slimy motions appear streaks of blood, though not always.Sometimes, indeed, there is no passage of any blood whatever from first
to last.Notwithstanding, provided that the motions be frequent, slimy,
and attended with griping, the disease is a true bloody flux or
dysentery."The efficacy of opium in its treatment causes him to break
out in praises of the great God who has vouchsafed us a remedy of so
much power.But Sydenham was too good a practitioner not to know that
all treatment must be prefaced with laxatives.For "after I had
diligently and maturely weighed in my mind," he says, "the various
symptoms which occur during this disease, I discovered that it was a
fever--a fever, indeed, of a kind of its own--turned inwardly upon the
bowels.By means of this fever the hot and acrid humors contained in
the mass of the blood, and irritating it accordingly, are deposited in
the aforesaid parts through the meseraic arteries."The indications
then were plain--viz."after revulsion by venesection to draw off the
acrid humors by purging."It was the frequent and successful practice
of Sydenham also to drench the patient with liquids, per os et per
rectum--a mode of treatment which both he and the learned Butler, who
accompanied the {782} English ambassador to Morocco, where dysentery
was always epidemic, hit upon, "neither of us borrowing our practice of
the other."Butler declared that the method of deluging the dysentery
by liquids was the best.But many attacks are cured almost on the
expectant plan alone.This was the case with the excellent and learned
Daniel Coxe, Doctor of Physic, in whom "the gripes and bloody motions
ceased after the fourth clyster.He was kept to his bed, limited to
milk diet; and this was all that was necessary in order to restore him
to perfect health."Zimmermann (1767) did not believe that improper food could be a cause
of dysentery, as in the epidemic of 1765 fresh grapes were plentifully
supplied to patients and proved an excellent remedy.He also noticed
the muscular pains (rheumatism) which had been mentioned by Sydenham
before him, and the paralyses first noticed by Fabricius in 1720, as
occurring in the course of, or as sequelae to, the disease.It was only
contagious, he thought, in bad cases, when the stools have a cadaveric
odor.But his main and most useful contributions were in the field of
therapy.He discarded venesection entirely, was among the first to
recognize the value of ipecacuanha, and objected strenuously to opium
until the cause of the evil was expelled.Hence he was vehemently
opposed to all astringents, to the use of which he ascribes the
rheumatisms and dropsies which sometimes occur.Wines and spices were
likewise put under ban; whey he permitted, but not milk, and water
freely, but always warm.Barley-water and cream of tartar were
sufficient food and medicine for ordinary cases, while camphor and
cinchona best sustain the strength in bad cases.Pringle (1772) observed the frequent occurrence of dysentery
coincidently with malarial fever, and was a firm believer in the
contagion of the disease.He claimed that the foul straw upon which the
soldiers slept became infectious, but maintained that the chief source
of infection were the privies "after they had received the dysenteric
excrements of those who first sicken."It is spread in tents and in
hospitals, and may be carried by bedding and clothing, as in the
plague, small-pox, and measles.Neither food nor drink propagates the
disease, he thinks, for, so far as the fruits are concerned, he too had
seen it prevail before the fruits were ripe.The first cause of the
disease is "a stoppage of the pores, checking the perspiration and
turning inward of the humors upon the bowels."Antimony was his
specific in its treatment.He was also fond of Dover's powder in its
relief, and preferred fomentations to opium, which "only palliates and
augments the cause."The best drink for patients with dysentery was
lime-water (one-third) and milk.This period of time is made memorable in the history of dysentery, as
of nearly all internal diseases, by the contributions from direct
observation upon the dead body by the father of pathological anatomy,
John Baptist Morgagni (1779).From the days of Hippocrates down, the
seat of the disease had been, as has been shown, pretty accurately
determined, and the same acumen which enabled the clinicians to
localize the affection had inspired them, as we have seen, to define
and describe its nature.But any descriptions from actual post-mortem
examinations were not put upon record until the beginning of the
sixteenth century, when were published the posthumous contributions of
Benivieni (1506-07).In his description of the lesions of the disease
he says that "the viscera displayed {783} internal erosion from which
sanies was continually discharged."Nearly three centuries elapsed
before Morgagni made his anatomical studies--an interval of time void
of any contributions from pathological anatomy; and so little attention
was paid to this branch of medical science that the descriptions of
Morgagni and of his more immediate successors failed to excite any
general interest or make any permanent impression.Morgagni himself,
while he fully recognized their significance, did not consider the
ulcerations of dysentery as absolutely essential to the disease, as
many cases, even fatal ones, did not exhibit them at all.They were not
liable to be mistaken for the lesions of typhoid fever, the ulceration
of Peyer's glands, because, though they may, they only rarely, coexist
in the same subject.As to the membranous fragments sometimes evacuated
with the discharges of dysentery, Morgagni showed that they are
occasionally true fragments or shreds of the intestinal coats, as has
been maintained by the older writers, Tulpius and Laucisius, but are
far more frequently nothing else than inspissated mucus--conceptions
which subsequent studies with the microscope have fully confirmed.In view of the general disregard of direct observations, it is
therefore not surprising to learn that the nature of the intestinal
lesions gradually fell into oblivion or at least became underrated in
its import.But it is a matter of surprise that Stoll (1780) was able
to declare as the result of autopsies made by himself that, although
the colon is thickened and inflamed, ulcerations in dysenteries are
very rare.This distinguished author did not at all believe in the
contagion of the disease, as he had never seen it attack physicians or
nurses.It developed, he thought with the older writers, as the result
of exposure to cold during a perspiration.He emphatically insisted
upon the frequency of rheumatism as complicating the disease, and
describes in proof a number of cases of painful swollen joints during
and subsequent to the attack.It was his especial merit to have
succeeded in dispensing with the acrid bile as a cause of the disease,
maintaining that hepatic derangements were only accidental
complications, and thus disposed, but only for a time, of bilious
dysentery in so far as it was supposed to depend upon defective or
abnormal action of the liver.But Annesley (1828) soon reinstated the liver in the pathology of
dysentery, with the exhibition of  plates displaying abscess of
the liver in connection with the disease, as well as illustrating the
displacements and constrictions of the colon which sometimes occur in
its course.The fourth decade of our century now brought in the anatomical
contributions of Cruveilhier and Rokitansky, to be followed later by
those of Virchow, upon which the modern morbid anatomy of the disease
is based; while the labors of the Indian physicians and of Copeland,
Parkes, and Vaidy put us in possession of the facts pertaining to its
general pathology.Fayrer has quite recently published the results of
his vast experience with dysentery in India, an important contribution
to the practical study of the disease, and Hirsch has treated
exhaustively of its medical geography.But the merit of publication of
the most complete chapter or work upon dysentery that has ever been
written anywhere belongs to, and is the especial pride of, our own
country.It constitutes the bulk of the second volume of the _Medical
and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion_.It is a veritable
encyclopaedia of knowledge, not {784} only upon the subject of which it
treats, but upon all subjects immediately or even remotely collateral
to it, and is a lasting monument to the labor and the learning of its
author, Joseph J. Woodward, Surgeon of the United States Army.GENERAL REMARKS.--Dysentery may be a primary or a secondary disease.As
a primary disease it occurs in sporadic, endemic (often closely,
sometimes curiously, circumscribed), or epidemic form, and is either
acute or chronic, according to the nature of its symptoms and lesions.The ancient types of sthenic and asthenic or adynamic, typhoid,
bilious, and malarial dysenteries belong rather to history than to
modern medicine.The classification of cases in general use at
present--viz.the catarrhal and croupous or diphtheritic forms--has
reference rather exclusively to the nature of the lesion, and is hence
extremely defective.Nor are the divisions (as in cholera) into
sporadic and epidemic forms much more satisfactory, in that they
indicate simply the range or extent of the disease, and by no means
define a separate array of symptoms or lesions; precisely the same
symptoms or lesions being encountered in individual cases of either
form.None of these divisions clearly indicate differences in etiology,
upon which factor alone can any acceptable division of cases be based.Perhaps less objection may be urged against the assumption of catarrhal
and specific forms, including under the provisional term catarrhal all
the cases which cannot as yet be accounted for by the action of a
special or specific cause.It will become apparent in the study of the etiology of dysentery that
while any of the factors invoked may suffice to produce the catarrhal
(sporadic) form, none will explain the specific (epidemic) form of the
disease; both forms may be alike in their lesion and signs, but they
differ widely in their cause.In other words, dysentery is only a
clinical, and is in no way an etiological, expression of a disease.In
this respect dysentery finds its analogue in a much grosser lesion of
the bowels--namely, occlusion, acute or chronic, which, while it
presents pretty much the same train of symptoms, may depend upon a
great variety of causes, as impaction, strangulation, intussusception,
etc.While any of the causes cited may be sufficient to excite the
catarrhal form of the disease, the same causes may stand to the
specific form only in the relation of predisposing agents.Or, as
Maclean has better put it, "It appears that many of the so-called
causes of dysentery must be regarded more as acute agents of
propagation than of causation."As a secondary disease dysentery occurs in the course of, or as a
sequel to (not infrequently as the terminal affection of), pyaemia and
septicaemia (puerperal fever), typhus and typhoid fevers, pneumonia,
Bright's disease, variola, scarlatina, abscess of the liver (though the
order of sequence is here oftener reversed), scorbutus, marasmus from
any cause, tuberculosis, and cancer.It must not be forgotten, however,
of these latter affections that each produces its own lesions in the
large intestine, which are not to be confounded with those of genuine
dysentery.The view that dysentery shows a periodicity of recurrence at certain
distinct intervals or cycles--three, five, or ten years--is entirely
without foundation in fact; but there is strong ground for believing
that the disease is gradually abating both in frequency and virulence
with improvements in sanitation and hygiene.Thus, Heberden shows that
the {785} number of deaths set down in the seventeenth century under
the titles of bloody flux and gripings of the guts was never less than
1000 annually, and in some years exceeded 4000, whereas during the last
century the number gradually dwindled down to 20 (Watson)--a number
which is certainly a misprint for 200; and Aitken states that as a
cause of death it has been decreasing since 1852.Geissler also
remarks[1] that the variation in epidemics is nowhere so well
illustrated as in the case of dysentery.A noticeable reduction in the
number of cases in England began about 1850, and has continued almost
without interruption to the present time, so that now (1880) six to
eight times less cases occur than in the forties.The same diminution
has been noticed in Bavaria and Sweden.In Sweden the cases treated by
physicians in 1857 numbered no less than 37,000, with over 10,000
deaths; whereas now the number is reduced to 400-500 a year, and the
mortality has experienced a corresponding reduction from 20-30 to 6-8
per cent.[Footnote 1: _Periodische Schwanderungen der wichtigsten Krankheiten_.]At the same time, it is known of dysentery that it sometimes shows an
almost freakish recurrence after long intervals of time, appearing in a
place for many decades free from the disease, to establish itself there
for years as a regular endemic malady, not to disappear again for a
long series of years; in which respect, Hirsch remarks, it much
resembles malaria.Allusion has been already made to the occasional curious
circumscription of the disease in definite localities.In fact,
dysentery, even when late to assume the proportions of a widespread
epidemic, begins, as a rule, and is confined for a time, in individual
enclosed regions--prisons, barracks, hospitals, etc.; and in the
process of dissemination it is rather characteristic of the disease to
leap over or to spare intervening territory and appear in new foci at
some distance from its original seat.A direct irradiation or linear
transmission of the disease is the exception, and not the rule.The
significance of this fact will become evident in the study of the
etiology of the disease.Dysentery is pre-eminently a disease of army life, its victims among
soldiers numbering more than all other diseases together.Sir James
MacGrigor, Medical Superintendent of the British army, called it the
scourge of armies and the most fatal of all their diseases.Aitken says
that "it has followed the tracks of all the great armies which have
traversed Europe during the continental wars of the past two hundred
years."It decimated the French, Prussian, and Austrian armies in 1792.In Cape Colony in 1804 every fourth man among the soldiers was attacked
with the disease, and of those attacked every fifth man died.In
Napoleon's campaign in Egypt dysentery numbered one-half more victims
than the plague; Kinglake says that 5000 men died of dysentery alone in
the war of the Crimea; and in our own country during our Civil War from
1861-65 chronic camp dysentery was the cause of more than one-fourth of
all the diseases reported, the mortality being at the rate of 12.36 per
1000.Woodward relates that the dysenteries, acute and chronic, with
diarrhoeas, made their appearance in the new regiments at the beginning
of the war, and, though mild at first, quickly assumed a formidable
character."Soon no army could move without leaving behind it a host of
the victims.They crowded the ambulance-trains, the railroad-cars, the
{786} steamboats.In the general hospitals they were often more
numerous than the sick from all other diseases, and rivalled the
wounded in multitude.They abounded in the convalescent camps, and
formed a large proportion of those discharged for disability."Most of
the prisoners died of this disease, and great numbers succumbed to it
on retirement to their homes after the cessation of the war.It is the
story of many a campaign, Eichhorst says, that dysentery kills more men
than the enemy's guns.The fact that it sometimes shows itself in periodic form or with
periodic exacerbation, that it is sometimes successfully treated with
quinia, and that, as has been noticed from the days of Hippocrates
down, it prevails in greatest intensity in malarial regions, has given
rise to the view that dysentery is a malarial disease.This view, which
was strongly advocated by many of the older writers, Senac, Fournier,
Annesley, met with renewed support at the hands of many of the surgeons
in our Civil War.But wider observation has shown the fallacy of such a
view; for not only may the diseases prevail entirely independently of
each other in malarial regions, but there are regions where one does
and the other does not exist.Thus Huebner quotes from Rollo concerning
St.Lucie (West Indies), a town situated on a mountain in the midst of
a swampy country in which both dysentery and malaria abound, while the
town itself is almost free from dysentery; and Dutrolan cites Reunion
as a place where marsh fevers do not occur, while dysentery is very
common.Berenger-Feraud[2] scouts the idea of any such connection.Pierre de la Martinique," he says, "where there is
not a piece of marsh as big as a hand, but where dysentery has made
great ravage more than once.We might cite also Mauritius, Gibraltar,
Malta, New Caledonia--places exempt, or almost exempt, from malaria,
but often visited by dysentery."[Footnote 2: _Traite theorique et clinique de la Dysenterie, etc._,
Paris, 1883.]The view that dysentery is a form of typhus or typhoid fever
(Eisenmann) or scurvy needs no refutation in the light of existing
knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and pathology of these affections.These diseases may often complicate, but can never cause, dysentery.Dysentery is a disease which spares no age, sex, or social condition,
the seeming greater suffering of the poorer classes being due to the
filth, food, darkness, dampness--in short, to the bad sanitation--of
poverty.Though the disease is often confined exclusively to soldiers in the
midst of a civil population, examples are not wanting of an exclusive
selection of civilians or of an indiscriminate attack in every
direction.Lastly, dysentery is a disease which may recur repeatedly in
the same individual, one attack rather predisposing to than preventing
another.ETIOLOGY.--Dysentery is an omnipresent disease."Wherever man is,"
Ayres observed of it nearly a quarter of a century ago, "there will
some of its forms appear."But the character of the form, and more
especially the extent and severity of the disease, vary in extreme
degree with the conditions surrounding the abode of man.No one of
these conditions affects the disease so markedly as the climate.It is
the testimony of Hirsch, based upon the study of seven hundred
epidemics of the disease, that no other disease is so dependent upon
the influence of the climate.The home of dysentery is the tropical
zone.It prevails in greatest frequency {787} and virulence in the
tropics, and in those regions of the tropics where the characteristics
of this zone are more pronounced, diminishes in intensity in the
temperate regions, and occurs only in sporadic form farther north.At
40 degrees latitude the line may be pretty sharply drawn; beyond it
dysentery as an epidemic is almost unknown.[3]

[Footnote 3: Shakespeare (_Troilus and Cressida_) cites "griping of the
guts" among the "rotten diseases of the south."]India has been from time immemorial the hotbed of this disease.Henderson says it is perhaps more fatal to natives than all other
diseases put together, and Hutchinson, Hunter, and Tytler observe that
it causes three-fourths of the deaths among the natives of Hindostan.In Egypt the disease is indigenous, and is, according to Frank, post
pestem maxime timendus.Greisinger reports that one-half of all the
autopsies made by him in Egypt showed dysentery as a primary or
secondary affection.It is epidemic here at all times, Roser says, and
all fatal cases of acute or chronic disease finally perish with it.Similar testimony might be adduced from a large part of Africa, much of
Asia, the Indian Archipelago, and the West Indies.It rages
"murderously" in Peru, causing a mortality in some epidemics of 60 to
80 per cent., and occurs in this country not only in the valleys, but
in cities and provinces at the lofty elevation of 8000 to 13,000 feet.Heat, moisture, vegetable decomposition, and sudden atmospheric change
are the distinguishing characteristics of southern climes, and the
study of the etiology of a disease incident or indigenous to these
conditions calls for an investigation of these various factors.It is well established of dysentery that it occurs for the most part in
the hottest season of the year.Of 546 epidemics tabulated by Hirsch,
404 prevailed in summer and fall, 113 in fall and winter, 16 in spring
and summer, and only 13 in winter.Fourteen-fifteenths of the whole
number of epidemics occurred in the months of June to September.And it
is corroborative of these conclusions that of 1500 deaths from
dysentery in the cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Baltimore from 1816 to 1827, 1100 occurred in the months of July,
August, and September.In fact, the Census Reports (1860-70) of our
country show the maximum mortality in August and September, and the
minimum in January and February.The prevalence of unusual heat may also call out an epidemic in places
where the disease usually shows itself only in endemic or sporadic
form.Thus, the severe epidemic of 1540 in England was preceded by a
heat so intense as to dry up the wells and small streams, in
consequence of which many cattle died of thirst; and the epidemics of
1583 in Germany, of 1758 in France, and of 1847 in our own country,
were characterized in the same way.Interesting in this connection is
the statement of Frick concerning the epidemic in Baltimore in 1849,
who found the cases to increase and decrease almost in proportion to
the elevation and depression of temperature.The epidemic of Weimar in
1868, where 12,000 people fell ill with the disease, illustrated the
rule when it ceased suddenly on the approach of cool weather at the end
of August.But that heat alone is not sufficient to account for the genesis of the
disease is apparent from the occasional occurrence of it in the tropics
in the colder seasons of the year; in the colder climates, Russia,
Sweden, {788} and Canada; and in temperate regions during exceptionally
cool seasons, as in Plymouth in 1769, London in 1808, Massachusetts in
1817.Moreover, the temperate zone is often characterized by seasons of
unusual heat, during the prevalence of which dysentery may be almost
unknown.Thus, during the summer of 1881, in Cincinnati, the
thermometer scarcely fell below 95 degrees F. for weeks at a time, and
was often nearly 100 degrees during the entire night, but the records
at the Health Office show that while cases of heatstroke were
alarmingly frequent, dysentery was unusually rare during the entire
season.That moisture cannot act more, at most, than as an occasional
predisposing cause of dysentery is sufficiently clear from the
statement of Hirsch, that of 119 epidemics, 62 commenced or were
preceded by wet and 57 by dry weather.In truth, dryness long continued
and excessive heat have already been invoked as remote causes of the
disease.But moisture, as contributing to, or being a necessary element
of, vegetable decomposition, the third characteristic of tropical
regions, is entitled to further consideration.Annesley observed that
among troops stationed in the vicinity of rivers, canals, and places
abounding with emanations from the decay of animal and vegetable
matters dysentery became extremely prevalent and assumed a more or less
malignant nature; and Baly, who studied the disease in its famous
outbreak in the Milbank Penitentiary, remarks that "it is greatest at
those seasons and in those states of the atmosphere which most favor
decomposition of organic matter in the soil."In Africa it has been noticed that dysentery appears with the rainy
season, to disappear only at its close; and the same observation has
been made of Bengal, while in Lower Egypt the disease follows the
inundations of the Nile.Burkhardt says of 10,000 cases that one-half
occur in wet hot seasons, two-fifths in dry hot seasons, and but
one-tenth in cold seasons.Moreover, the removal of camping-grounds to
dry localities has often arrested the disease or checked its further
dissemination.Thus, Mursinna states that the removal of the army of
Prince Henry of Hesse from Nimes, where the disease raged fearfully, to
Leitmeritz was attended by its immediate cessation, notwithstanding the
fact that the soldiers ate large quantities of fruit.A statement of
Dillenius, quoted by Heubner, is in this connection exceedingly
instructive: "Dillenius had to march with a dysentery hospital of more
than 500 patients from July 26 to August 3, 1812, and it required four
whole days to accomplish an ordinary nine or ten hours' march.The
patients, extremely exhausted, were finally put into a sheep-shed.Here, in the fresh air and lying on hay, they all improved very
quickly.By advice of the physician they ate for medicine the fresh
whortleberries which they themselves had picked."Werneck attributes
the exemption of the city of Halle since the end of the last century to
the draining and drying of the neighboring marshes.On the other hand, numerous observations go to prove that dysentery is
likewise prevalent in dry sandy soils where the factors so necessary to
the production of malaria are entirely unknown.Thus, Hirsch quotes
from Harthill to the effect that dysentery never occurred among the
English troops in Afghanistan until they entered upon its thoroughly
dry and sandy plains; and from Lidell, who declared that the disease
prevailed most in Panama in March, the dry season at this place.Again,
a striking confirmation of exemption from dysentery in a marshy region
{789} is offered in the Antilles at Grande-Terre, "a wet, marshy plain
severely visited by malaria, but used by patients attacked with chronic
dysentery at Basse-Terre as the safest place of refuge and recovery."The role of moisture and vegetable decomposition may be, then, summed
up in the words of Annesley, that "all situations which furnish
exhalations from the decay of animal or vegetable productions under the
operation of a moist and hot state of the atmosphere will always
occasion dysentery in the predisposed subject--_circumstances which,
with other causes_ [italics ours], combine to generate the disease."Atmospheric vicissitudes, checking of perspiration, catching cold, are
synonyms in the present popular as in the ancient professional
conception of the genesis of dysentery."Of the remote causes of
dysentery," Johnson says, "I need say little; they are the same in all
parts of the world--atmospheric vicissitudes."And in making this
statement the author expresses the almost universal testimony of the
Indian physicians."Sudden change of temperature," observes
Kaputschinsky of the Trans-Caucasus, where dysentery is rife, "is in
this region no rarity.The sultry heat of noon often alternates with a
cutting cold wind, and vice versa.In the same place is now a warm, now
a cold, now a glowing hot breeze, and such changes most predispose to
dysentery."And McMullin says of the Barbadoes that "it is a curious
fact that this disease is most prevalent where from the immediate
contiguity of mountains sudden vicissitudes of temperature are
experienced."Didelot says also of South France, "It is not the fruits,
as people still believe to-day, which act as causes of dysentery, but
the sudden variations of the air."Ruthay remarks of the dysentery of
China that the most common cause is a chill caught by sleeping in a
draught uncovered or in the open air.Metzler attributes the exemption
of Stuttgart (since 1811) from any great epidemic to the fact that the
city lies in a valley open only to the east, which permits no contrast
of hot days and cold nights; and Seeger, in speaking of the epidemic
which occurred in Ludwigsberg in 1872 (a city of twelve thousand
population, where no epidemic of any kind had appeared since 1834, and
where 870 were suddenly attacked with dysentery) that it first broke
out in Kaffeeburg in two streets exposed to the wind, and thence spread
to different parts of the city.Exposure of the body, especially the
abdomen, during sleep or when perspiring, the sudden laying aside of
flannel body-clothes, are proceedings, Fayrer says, pregnant with
danger in dysenteric regions.A lamentable dysentery appeared,
according to Trotter, on board H.M.S.Berwick Oct., 1780, "in
consequence of the hurricane on the fifth of the month, by which the
clothes and bedding of the seamen, and indeed all parts of the ship,
were soaked in water, and many of the men slept for nights together on
the wet decks overcome with fatigue and debilitated from want of food."Fayrer also quotes from Moseley the observation that "it often happens
that hundreds of men in a camp have been seized with the dysentery
almost at the same time after one shower of rain or from lying one
night in the wet and cold."As illustrating the conjoined operation of all these various causes,
together with filth and foul effluvia, more especially exposure to
cold, the story of dysentery was never better told than by Sir James
MacGrigor, who, in speaking of the Peninsular campaign, remarks that
"the army during June as well as July was traversing Castile, where it
was {790} exposed to the direct influence of a burning sun darting its
rays through a sky without a single cloud, the troops marching and
fighting during the day, and bivouacking during the night on arid,
unsheltered plains.They felt at times every vicissitude of heat and
cold.In the rapid advance they could not be regularly supplied with
food or had not time to cook it, and not unfrequently indulged in bad
wine and unripe fruit."... The thousands of sick (chiefly from
diarrhoea, dysentery, and remittent fever) were hurried off to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the nearest hospital-station to the frontier of Portugal, a
town "composed chiefly of ruins with very narrow streets,"... and from
having been "so much the object of contest, and alternately the site of
the hospitals of all the contending armies, nearly twenty thousand
bodies were calculated to have been put into the earth either in the
town or under its walls in the course of a few months."... "It may
easily be conceived," the author adds, "in what state cases of
dysentery must have arrived after having sustained a journey in extent
from four to twenty days, conveyed chiefly in bullock-carts or on the
backs of mules, sometimes under incessant rain for several days
together."It is really quite superfluous to cite further opinions or examples in
illustration of a fact which is so universally conceded as to be
exaggerated in its general significance.Taking cold is the common idea
of the cause of dysentery, and is always a satisfactory explanation in
a case of obscure origin in this or any disease, even though the
patient may be able to recall no possible exposure.The physician
himself contents himself only too easily with resort to this refuge,
and with further appeal to the locus minoris resistentiae, as the
explanation of the seat of the disease, which he hopes to cure with the
aid of the vis medicatrix naturae.But taking cold is only a popular
paraphrase for contracting a disease, and will bear no scientific
analysis of its meaning.Mere reduction of temperature will certainly
not produce a disease whose habitat is the hottest zone, nor will a
sudden chill of the surface be accepted as a sufficient cause so long
as men daily remain exempt after a sudden plunge into cold water.Some
other factor must be invoked to account for the outbreak of specific
(epidemic) dysentery.The influence of the nervous system, the mechanical and chemical or
specific action of the ingesta and dejecta, remain to be especially
considered in the etiology of the disease.The influence of the nervous system is more directly seen in the
production of diarrhoeas than dysenteries, but that sustained
disturbances of the emotions play an important part in the production
of dysentery is shown by the greater frequency of the disease among
prisoners of war.In the Franco-Prussian war the French prisoners
suffered more than the Germans, and the records of prison-life in our
own war, at Andersonville, Libby, and Salisbury, furnish ghastly
chapters in the history of this disease.Many other factors contribute
to the development of the disease under such circumstances--in fact,
all the cruelties of man's inhumanity to man--but the influence of the
nervous system is too plain to be mistaken.The communication between
the cervical ganglia and the sympathetic nerve-fibres which preside
over the cerebral circulation and regulate intestinal peristalsis has
been invoked (Glax) in explanation of the direct action of the brain
upon the intestinal canal.Curious in this {791} connection is the
claim of Savignac, who considered dysentery a disease of the nervous
system because in two cases he found spots of softening in the spinal
cord.The noxious action of irritating articles of diet has been recognized
in the production of dysentery from the earliest times.Aretaeus
mentions acrid foods, and Aetius crudities, as directly causing the
disease; and unripe fruits have been especially stigmatized from the
days of Galen down.Decomposing, fermenting food and drink cause
diarrhoea much more frequently than dysentery, but if the irritation be
severe or prolonged, or be superimposed upon a catarrhal state, a
diarrhoea, it is claimed, may pass over into dysentery.Impurities in
drinking-water were charged with causing dysentery by Hippocrates
himself, with whom Avicenna fully coincided; and the view that
epidemics of the disease are caused in this way has been abundantly
advocated ever since.So far as running water is concerned, the
researches of Pettenkofer have shown that all impurities are speedily
destroyed, for even at the distance of a few rods from the reception of
sewage the water is perfectly safe.Nor does standing water lack the
means of purification, provided it be sufficiently exposed to the air.The observations of Roth and Lex have shown that the water of the wells
of fifteen churchyards in Berlin contained nitrates in less quantity
than the average wells in the city; and Fleck made a similar statement
with regard to the wells of Dresden.But no one in our day would rely
upon a mere chemical analysis in the detection of the organic poisons
or particles of disease.It is the physiological test which remains the
most conclusive, and the evidence in favor of the production of
dysentery by the ingestion of drinking-water poisoned by the reception
of excrementitious matter, especially the dejecta of disease, is as
positive as in the case of typhoid fever.Thus, De Renzy found that the
number of cases of dysentery "immediately decreased at Sibsagor (India)
so soon as better drinking-water was obtained from wells deeply sunk
and lined with earthenware glazed pipes;" and Payne found that the
cases of dysentery (as well as diarrhoea and lumbrici) almost
disappeared from the asylum at Calcutta as soon as the habit of
drinking water from the latrines was stopped.In face of such facts,
which might be infinitely multiplied, one would hesitate to subscribe
to the statement of Fergusson that "true dysentery is the offspring of
heat and moisture, of moist cold in any shape after excessive heat; but
nothing that a man could put into him would ever give him a true
dysentery."The relation of the action of the dejecta must be studied from the
double standpoint of the development and the dissemination of the
disease, as originating the catarrhal form by mechanical or chemical
irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and as spreading the specific form
by direct or indirect infection.By the time the contents of the alimentary canal have reached the colon
they have become, through absorption of their fluids, more or less
inspissated, and hence as hard, globular masses fill the sacculi of the
large intestine.Mechanical irritations by crude, indigestible residue
of any kind of food, more especially of vegetable food, or chemical
irritations, as by fermenting food, accumulate in this region, fret the
mucous membrane into a state of inflammation, even ulceration, and
produce the anatomical picture and the clinical signs of dysentery.If
there be a superadded or {792} pre-existent catarrhal condition of the
mucosa or a defective peristalsis of the muscular coat, which is
sluggish enough at best, the development of a pathological state is
much facilitated.And there is no doubt that the dysentery of the
tropics is increased by the bulky, indigestible, feces-producing
character of the food.The anatomical construction of the colon may also favor these processes
by its mere abnormal length or size or by duplicatures in its course.The protracted constipation of the insane, in whom the transverse colon
is often found elongated or displaced--to assume the well-known M-form,
for instance--may partially account for the frequency of dysentery in
these cases (Virchow), though the neglect which comes of preoccupation
of the mind, with the general inhibition of peristalsis, is a more
frequent cause of the constipation.Wernich (1879) sums up the action of the feces, independently of a
specific cause, in attributing the dysentery of the tropics, aside from
the great changes of temperature, to (1) bad aborts, the dejecta being
deposited in all parts of the towns or into an opening made in the
floor of the hut, with which is associated total lack of personal
cleanliness; (2) to the diet, which causes a large amount of feces; and
(3) to the relaxation of the intestine in general, permitting
accumulations of infecting matter.Upon the question of the propagation of the disease by the dejecta rest
in great measure the all-important problems of a specific virus and of
the contagiousness of the disease.It is the almost universal opinion of those who have had the
opportunity of widest observation that epidemic dysentery arises from,
or is due to, a specific cause, a miasm, a malaria (in its wide
etymologic sense, bad air), which emanates from the soil.The
simultaneous sudden attack of great numbers under the most diverse
surroundings admits of explanation in no other way.But the precise
nature of the morbific agent is still unknown.The similarity of
epidemic dysentery to malaria would indicate the existence of a low
form of vegetable life, a schizomycete, as the direct cause of the
disease.But the proof of the presence of a specific parasite or germ
is still lacking, and though its speedy disclosure by means of the
solid-culture soils may be confidently predicted, it cannot, in the
light of existing knowledge, be declared as yet.Especial difficulty is encountered in the study of micro-organisms in
diseases of the alimentary canal because of the myriad variety in
enormous numbers found in healthy stools.Decomposition and
fermentation both begin in the large intestine, so that the feces swarm
with the bacteria and torulae productive of these processes.Woodward
declares that his own observations have satisfied him that "a large
part of the substance of the normal human feces is made up of these low
forms in numbers which must be estimated by hundreds of millions in the
feces of each day," bacteria, micrococci, and torulae being found
"floating in countless multitudes along with fragments of
partly-digested muscular fibres and other debris from the food;" but
while the torulae are increased, the other micro-organisms, bacteria,
etc., do not appear to be more numerous in the stools of dysentery than
in healthy feces.The doctrine that dysentery depends upon parasites is very old in
medicine, and included animal as well as vegetable growths.Langius
(1659) declared that swarms of worms could be found in dysenteric
stools, and {793} Nyander (1760) went so far as to call dysentery a
scabies intestinorum interna; which extravagant conception would have
speedily met with merited oblivion had not his preceptor, the great
Linnaeus, incorporated the Acarus dysenteriae into his _Systema
Naturae_.Sydenham about this time (1670) expressed a much clearer
conviction of the cause of the disease when he spoke of "particles
mixed with the atmosphere which war against health and which determine
epidemic constitutions."Baly (1849) first proclaimed the idea of a vegetable fungus, similar to
that described by Brittan and Swayne in cholera, as the parasite of the
disease; and Salisbury (1865) described algoid cells and species of
confervae as occurring abundantly in all well-marked cases.Klebs
(1867) found spore-heaps and rod-like bacteria in the stools of
dysentery as in cholera, but maintained that those of dysentery were
larger and thinner than those of cholera.Hallier (1869) maintained
that although there was no morphological difference in the
micro-organisms of the stools of dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera,
he was able by culture-experiments to develop the micrococcus of
dysentery into a special fungus, which he called Leiosporium
dysentericum.Busch (1868) demonstrated nests and colonies of
micrococci, as well as mycelium, in the villi and among the glands of
the mucous and submucous tissues in the cases of dysentery from Mexico
which he examined, but Heubner (1870) was able to disclose them in
equal numbers in preserved preparations or fresh contents of healthy
intestines.Dyer[4] (1870) believes that the parasites constituting the
mildew or sweat which forms a viscous pellicle upon fruit is the agent
which directly produces and propagates the disease.Mere immaturity of
fruit gives rise only to diarrhoea.This parasite occurs in some years
more than others, which accounts for the irregularity of occurrence of
the disease.He avers that it is only necessary to clean fruit, more
especially plums, to prevent the disease.This suggestion merits place
only as a curiosity in the history of the mycology of dysentery.[Footnote 4: _Journal f. Kinderkrankheiten_, No.More important are the results of the experiments of Rajewski (1875),
who found the lymph-spaces filled with bacteria, and who was able to
produce a diphtheritic exudation upon the surface and in the substance
of the mucous membrane of the colon by the injection of fluids
impregnated with bacteria into the bowels or blood of rabbits; but this
result was only obtained when the mucous membrane had been previously
irritated or brought into a catarrhal state by the introduction of
dilute solutions of ammonia.It remains for subsequent investigation to
confirm these highly significant conclusions, which, when properly
interpreted, may explain the action of the predisposing and exciting
causes of the disease.Rajewski's bacteria, it is needless to state,
were simply the bacteria of common putrefaction.Lastly, Prior (1883)
describes a micrococcus as the special micro-organism of dysentery, and
Koch (1883), in prosecuting his studies of cholera in Egypt, remarks
incidentally upon a special bacillus which he encountered in the
intestinal canal in dysentery, though he is as yet by no means prepared
to ascribe to it pathogenetic properties.The question of contagion hinges upon the specificness of the disease,
and cannot be definitely determined until this problem is finally
solved.The old writers believed in the contagion of dysentery.Helidaeus {794} declared that he "had often seen it communicated by the
use of clyster-pipes previously used in the treatment of those
suffering with the disease, and not properly cleaned;" and Horstius and
Hildanus speak of the communicability of the disease from the latrines
contaminated by dysenteric excreta.Van Swieten maintained that
washerwomen contract it, and that physicians and nurses might be
affected.Degner saw the disease spread from street to street in
Nimeguen, while every one who came in contact with the disease became
affected.Pringle observed it spread from tent to tent in the same way;
and Tissot went so far as to declare, "Sil ya une maladie veritablement
contagieuse c'est celle ci."Ziemssen believed that the disease is only
contagious when the element of crowd-poisoning is superadded; and
Heubner states that trustworthy army surgeons in the Franco-Prussian
War frequently saw infection occur when many severe cases were heaped
together in a small space.Under these circumstances thorough
disinfection of the privies checked the spread of the disease.But it
was the universal testimony of these surgeons, as also of our own
surgeons of the Civil War, that the disease was never transported to
the civil population by any of the tens of thousands of cases on their
return to their homes.By most modern writers dysentery is given a place, in respect to
contagion, between the exanthematous maladies, typhus and scarlatina,
which are without doubt contagious, and the purely miasmatic diseases,
malarial and yellow fevers, which are without doubt not contagious.Dysentery is ranked with typhoid fever, which is contagious, not by
contact with the body, but with the discharges.It is not a question in
dysentery of epithelial drift or pulmonary exhalations, but of
ingestion or reception of the dejecta of the disease.By this
observation it is intended to convey the impression that dysentery,
like typhoid fever, is mostly spread in this way, but the reverse may
be true; it may be spread, like yellow fever and malaria, by poisons in
the air.But dysentery, as has been repeatedly remarked, is only a
clinical expression of a disease which may be caused in many ways; and
among these causes, least potent perhaps, but present nevertheless, is
contagion.For, not to mention the epidemics which were undoubtedly
spread in this way, as among the Allies at Valmy in 1792, among the
French in Poland in 1807, and in the hospital at Metz in 1870,
dysentery has been directly communicated by the use of clysters,
bed-pans, and privies in a most unmistakable way.According to Eichhorst, the poison of dysentery is endowed with
extraordinary persistence of duration or tenacity of life in the
stools; for "observations are recorded where dysenteric stools have
been emptied into privies, and individuals employed to clean them out
after the lapse of ten years have been infected with the disease.These
observations go to prove, of this as of other similar affections
(typhoid fever), that the virus or microbe of the disease finds its
most favorable nidus in vaults, cesspools, sewers, etc.When the poison
is exposed to the air it is much more speedily destroyed, but is in the
mean time of course a possible conveyer of the disease."Fayrer quotes
from an anonymous writer, "whose views are as remarkable for their
force as for their originality," the rather extravagant assertion that
"if human excrement be not exposed to the air there can be no
dysentery."{795} Knoewenagel has recently[5] opened up a new series of reflections
in his suggestion of a possible direct infection of the large intestine
per rectum, where the disease usually begins and is mostly best
expressed.He calls attention to the fact that people who suffer with
constipation indulge in longer sessions at stools and induce in
straining efforts a degree of relaxation of the rectal mucosa.The
mucous membrane at its orifice may become at the same time abraded by
hardened fecal masses, to leave open surfaces or crevices upon which
germs may lodge.Moreover, aspiration follows the efforts at expulsion,
and the air with its particles is drawn directly into the rectum, thus
affording all the conditions for immediate or direct infection.[Footnote 5: _Schmidt's Jahrbucher_, Sept.At any rate, it must be admitted that the evidence in favor of
contagion is in some cases too strong to be ignored.A single instance
may suffice for illustration: Flugel reports that the towns of
Nordhaben and Reichenbach, containing together twenty-two hundred
inhabitants, were visited by dysentery in 1873, when nearly four
hundred people were attacked.The visit of a relative carried the
disease from Reichenbach to the daughter of an innkeeper at Tauchnitz,
and from this house the disease spread over the whole place, so that in
a short time more than one hundred people fell ill.Four to six,
sometimes as many as eleven, members of one family were successively or
simultaneously affected.The use of the same bed was the surest means
of contagion.The duration of the poison was proven in an exquisite case, which is,
however, not entirely free from objection: Two children of an officer
were severely affected in September and October, 1872.In January,
1873, the house was vacated and occupied by a successor in office,
whereupon in April, six months after dysentery had disappeared from the
place, the wife and child of the second officer were affected with the
disease.To sum up the etiology of dysentery in a few words, it may be said that
few chapters in medicine are so thoroughly unsatisfactory, as the
prospect of reconciling the accumulated discordant facts is very
discouraging.Because of the singular uniformity in the symptoms and
lesions the temptation is strong to look for a common cause, and to
ascribe all cases to this cause, explaining differences by degree
rather than by kind.Such a view would find solid support in the
assumption of a specific germ, and would ally dysentery with typhoid
fever, a disease which has likewise, in all cases, uniform symptoms and
lesions, and which prevails in both sporadic and epidemic form.The
advocates of this view would fix the poison of the disease in the air
and alimentary canal (but not in the blood), and explain the existence
of individual cases, as well as the prevalence of epidemics, by
meteorological conditions as affecting the growth or dissemination of
specific germs.Nor would the adoption of this view exclude the
possibility of producing the catarrhal (sporadic) cases by many kinds
of noxious germs, including those of common putrefaction.Hot air and
wet air are notorious bearers and breeders of germs, and the law of
gravity keeps them near the surface of the earth--conditions which
coincide with the prevalence of the disease in the tropics and among
individuals (soldiers) who sleep upon the ground.If the contagion of
the disease be admitted, the existence of a {796} contagium animatum is
implied at once, for no chemical poison has the power of propagation.But the germ of dysentery has not been found as yet, and until it has
been found, cultivated in suitable soil, and inoculated to produce the
disease, the evidence of its existence remains merely presumptive.So that at the present time dysentery must be regarded as a malady
which stands in closer relation to, or finds a better analogue in,
cholera than typhoid fever; for cholera is a disease which has the same
geography, has likewise nearly uniform symptoms and lesions, so far as
it leaves any, and certainly has two distinct forms of origin--one
clearly specific, cholera Asiatica, and the other catarrhal, cholera
morbus.PATHOLOGY.--Dysentery is a local malady, but, like every local malady
if sufficiently severe, it may show constitutional effects.It is
usually gradually ushered in from a lighter form of gastro-intestinal
catarrh.After a stage of incubation which lasts from a few hours to a
few days symptoms of dyspepsia and diarrhoea set in or increase,
attended with anorexia, heartburn, nausea, eructation or borborygmi,
pain in the abdomen, and copious fluid discharges.Hereupon ensue the
pains and the discharges characteristic of the disease.Violent griping
and colicky pains (tormina) traverse the abdomen, with sickening
sensations of depression.The desire of evacuation of the bowels
(tenesmus) becomes intense and more or less constant, and the discharge
itself is attended with little or no relief.At the same time the
region of the rectum, intensely inflamed, is the seat of intolerable
burning pain, which becomes excruciating with the introduction of a
speculum or the finger.The discharges may be copious, dark-brown, thin, and highly offensive
(bilious dysentery), may contain occasional hard round fecal casts of
intestinal sacculi (scybalae), or may become more and more scant, until
with the most violent efforts only the minutest quantity is extruded of
mucus, generally streaked or tinged with blood (rose mucus) like the
rusty sputum of pneumonia.Later, all effort at emptying the alimentary
canal may be futile (dysenteria sicca), or the mucus may be pure or
commingled with pus to remain perfectly colorless (dysenteria alba), or
with blood in larger quantity (dysenteria rubra).In other cases, or at
other periods in the same case, the discharges consist of fleshy masses
composed of inspissated mucus or pus, blood, and tissue-debris (lotura
carnea).Sometimes, though rarely, the discharges consist of pure
blood, but oftener of a copious turbid fluid, which on standing
separates into a clear upper layer of serum and a sediment of
disintegrated lotura carnea.Or, lastly, the sediment is composed of
small round vitreous masses, evidently swollen by maceration to look
like sago-grains, which have been erroneously supposed to represent the
liberated contents of the intestinal follicles.The general condition of the patient suffers correspondingly.There may
be fever or there may be none throughout the whole course of the
disease, but the pain and discharges quickly exhaust the strength of
the patient, and in severe or long-continued cases lead to emaciation
and profound prostration.The skin is hot and dry; the tongue is heavily coated; the face wears
an anxious expression.The abdomen is tumid with gases, or in more
advanced cases sunken, discolored, and tender, especially in the course
{797} of the colon, whose thickened walls may often be felt beneath the
emaciated surface.The anus is spasmodically constricted, or in the
worst cases paralyzed, patulous, and livid or blue.Prolapse of the
rectum is common in children, and excoriation of the perineum by the
acrid discharges is not infrequent.Finally, a typhoid state may set in or a pyaemia occur, when the
discharges may become involuntary or unconscious, and brain
symptoms--insomnia, stupor, delirium, and coma--supervene; or the
patient may linger long enough to perish by simple exhaustion or
marasmus.Under favorable hygiene the great majority of cases of catarrhal
dysentery recover without special treatment in the course of from three
to ten days, but specific dysentery has no definite duration and but
little tendency to spontaneous cure.The worst cases are often quickly
controlled by appropriate interference, and the most surprising results
may be sometimes obtained in cases of even years' duration.On the
other hand, a certain percentage of cases is characterized by a
defiance to every kind of treatment, including the last resort, a
change of climate.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery generally subsides without
lesions, and the natural duration of the attack may be much abbreviated
by proper treatment.Specific or epidemic dysentery lasts from two to
four weeks, or, becoming chronic, continues for years or for life, with
exacerbations and remissions.Various complications are liable to occur in the course of the disease.Three deserve especial mention--viz.affection of the joints
(rheumatism), paralysis, and abscess of the liver.Perforation and
peritonitis, always possibilities, and deformities of the colon,
thickenings, and constrictions, are not infrequently left.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions of dysentery are the ordinary signs of
inflammation of a mucous membrane and its subjacent structures.They do
not differ in any essential way from those of any mucous surface in a
state of inflammation, the minor variations being due to differences in
the anatomy and physiology of the part affected.Thus, a description of
the pathological process in inflammation of the pharynx, bronchi, or
uterus would answer upon the post-mortem table for the same process in
the large intestine, and the finer microscopic lesions could be
differentiated in any case only by the histology of the part affected.A slight lesion of any mucous membrane constitutes what is known as a
catarrhal process; a more grave affection, a diphtheritic process; a
more chronic inflammation, a hypertrophic or hyperplastic process.Hence an easy distinction between sporadic and epidemic cases might be
based upon the character of the lesion found.But, as has been stated
already, it is impossible to draw a line between catarrhal and specific
cases, the same lesions being found in either form.The difference, so
far as the morbid anatomy is concerned, is wholly in degree or stage,
and not at all in kind, the specific (epidemic) form presenting the
graver lesion as a rule.So most cases of sporadic dysentery show only
catarrhal lesions, while most cases of epidemic dysentery show
diphtheritic lesions.Catarrhal dysentery shows as its first obvious alteration a hyperaemia
of the mucous surface.It is limited exclusively to the large intestine
in the vast majority of cases, and only in rare exceptions affects the
small intestine, though cases have been mentioned as curiosities in
which the {798} process has reached the stomach in its upmost
prolongation.The hyperaemia is most marked, as a rule, in the lowest
parts of the large intestine, the rectum and descending colon, but
there is, as Virchow has pointed out, a peculiar predisposition to
affection at the seat of all the flexures, the iliac, hepatic, splenic,
sigmoid, where the additional element of fecal arrest or impaction is
superadded to the cause of the disease.The catarrhal process occurs first in detached spots or streaks upon
the projecting folds or duplicatures of the mucous membrane; which
spots coalesce to form extensive surfaces.Examined by transmitted
light, these surfaces show a distinct arborescence of the vessels.Or
the disease may commence in the follicles in distinct areas of the
large intestine, and may remain confined to these structures to
constitute the variety known as follicular dysentery.The hyperaemia of inflammation is attended with dilatation and paresis
of the vessel-walls and retardation of the circulation.The whole
process may be arrested at this stage, so that there escapes from the
vessels, at most, only serum to develop the oedema which, with the
defective nutrition from arrest of the circulation, gives rise to the
softening of the epithelial cells.These cells may be thus lifted from
their bed to constitute the process of desquamation, the fundamental
anatomical characteristic of acute dysentery, by which process the
submucous connective tissue is laid bare and the so-called catarrhal
ulcer results.Or the epithelium, but partially detached, may remain
upon the surface, "either raised in the shape of small vesicles which
contain clear serum, or it forms a grayish-white layer resembling the
mealy scurf of the epidermis--an appearance which probably induced
Linnaeus to term dysentery scabies intestinorum interna" (Rokitansky).Kelsch maintains that the inflammatory process in dysentery commences
in the delicate connective tissue between the follicles, the network of
small spindle-shaped cells with multiple nuclei becoming speedily
penetrated by a number of very small, newly-formed vessels.Where the
epithelium is desquamated the surface is covered with granulations as
after a wound.The disposition of the follicles is soon deranged, for,
instead of standing in rows like gun-barrels, they are pushed asunder
and uplifted, so as to remain at different heights.Their interior
becomes blocked with mucus or their orifices occluded, so that
retention-cysts are formed to give rise to the appearance of the bead
necklace.Soon the walls of neighboring follicles coalesce, dissolve
away, and communication is established between them.The interior of
these communicating tubes or canals is filled with vitreous mucus; the
walls are stripped of their lining cells, but their "blind extremities
contain still adherent colossal epithelial cells."Moreover, the
follicles break into each other under the proliferative budding
process, so that the end of a distorted tube may be found in the
interior of another.Where follicles are destroyed the mucous membrane
above them or in their vicinity collapses--a condition observed and
described by Colin as effrondement.The mucosa in these regions may
appear perfectly uninjured, but by "blowing upon it with a tube it is
lifted up like an ampulla to show an opening in its centre," though
more frequently the mucous membrane collapses or sinks in at the region
of destruction.The inner surface of the mucosa is rendered
additionally uneven by the elevations or protuberances caused by the
{799} proliferations in the submucous connective tissue.The older
writers (Pringle, Hewson) regarded these projections as tumors of the
mucosa, and Rokitansky, who describes their true nature, speaks of them
as warty, tubercular (nodular) swellings or fungoid
excrescences--constituting a condition, he says, which Gely has termed
hypertrophie mamelonne.The alternate elevations and depressions thus
produced have been likened to the representations of bird's-eye views
of mountain-chains.As a rule, occasional red blood-corpuscles are also permitted to escape
through the vessel walls in the process of diapedesis to give to the
surface mucus its characteristic tinge, and punctate submucous
hemorrhage is very frequently seen.The pressure of the swollen, softened mucosa upon the sensitive nerves,
and the irritation of the acrid intestinal contents, are often invoked
to account for the constant desire of defecation (tenesmus) which
constitutes such an essential symptom of the disease; but both the
tenesmus and the colicky pains (tormina) precede the anatomical
changes, and are much more rationally explained by the direct action
upon the nerves of the cause of the disease, or by the derangement of
innervation effected through changes in the circulation.An acute case of catarrhal dysentery may exhibit no further lesions,
and in the lightest cases even these may have entirely disappeared
post-mortem, so that no change at all may be observed at the autopsy.In a more severe or protracted case the other alterations which
constitute the more complete cycle of the inflammatory process follow
the stage of hyperaemia.The arrest of circulation becomes more or less
complete, and the white corpuscles emigrate from the vessels to form
the pus-cells.Fibrin, or the elements which compose it, also escapes
to infiltrate the mucous membrane and remain upon its surface.The
pseudo-membranous or diphtheritic process is now developed, and may
vary in intensity from a mere frosting of the surface to dense
infiltration of the entire thickness.The false membrane, as well as
the mucous membrane, next suffers necrosis to form more or less
extensive sloughs.These sloughs are grayish-white when fresh,
dark-brown when stained by the intestinal contents, or greenish or
black when undergoing gangrene.They may cover patches of the mucosa or
the whole mucosa from the ileo-caecal valve to the rectum.They soon
become soft and pultaceous, hang in flaps or festoons in the interior
of the intestinal tube, or, detached, are voided in fragments or
shreds.One such fragment nine inches long is recorded in Woodward's
exhaustive description of the pathology of this disease.Examined under
the microscope, they are seen to consist of coagulated fibrin, red and
white blood-corpuscles, epithelial cells and debris, necrotic pieces of
mucosa, and myriads of micrococci and other micro-organisms.The fall of the sloughs leaves the dysenteric ulcer.Its edges are
irregular and ragged, its base uneven like a crater, and its surface is
more or less covered with pultaceous debris.The submucous connective
tissue may form its base, or, this structure having been also
destroyed, the muscularis may be exposed, or in more extensive
necrobiosis the peritoneum itself may be laid bare.Occasionally this
last barrier is broken down, and perforation occurs.Or an acute
peritonitis may be developed, in dysentery as in typhoid fever, by
simple extension of the inflammatory {800} process without perforation.Perforation is very rare in cases of follicular ulceration, and is by
no means frequent in the diphtheritic process, but it is the most
frequent cause of peritonitis in chronic dysentery.It may occur in any
part of the colon, but does occur most frequently in the caecum.The
resulting peritonitis is fatal as a rule, but the danger is obviated
sometimes, as in typhoid fever, by agglutination of the gut to a
contiguous structure or viscus.Perforation usually occurs late in the
disease, but it may occur very early.Thus Nagele reports from the
Franco-Prussian War a case in which perforation took place on the
fourth day, the diagnosis having been confirmed by an autopsy.In rare
cases a perityphlitis may ensue, with its natural consequences, or
periproctitis may be developed with perineal abscess, or, finally,
fistulae may form to burrow about and discharge themselves anywhere in
or upon the surface of the abdomen, the lumbar region, or the thigh.Bamberger describes cases of perityphlitis attending dysentery, in some
of which resorption occurred, while in others pus was discharged upon
the surface of the abdomen; and the writer of this article once saw, in
consultation with T. A. Reamy, a case of fistula which extended from
the descending colon to the vagina.Through the opening made to
discharge the pus from a fluctuating abscess pointing in the vaginal
vault an india-rubber tube could be passed for six to eight inches.The
patient finally died from marasmus.Chronic dysentery is distinguished by the alterations which occur in
inflammation developing more gradually and extending over a longer
period of time.Under the irritative changes resulting from an altered
circulation the connective tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, so that
the wall of the intestine becomes at times enormously thickened, and
its calibre is often correspondingly diminished.Cornil observes that
acute or subacute dysentery is characterized by infiltration of the
submucous connective tissue, followed by destruction, while in chronic
dysentery the predominant lesion is essentially a proliferation and
thickening of the connective tissue of the large intestine.The
muscular tissue also undergoes hypertrophy, and the peritoneum becomes
thickened and opaque.Sometimes the peritoneum is covered with patches
of false membrane, or agglutination occurs with other portions of the
intestine to give rise to contortions or occlusions.Ulceration shows itself in chronic dysentery in every grade and stage
of the process, from the first denudations to old cicatrizations.In
bad cases the whole course of the colon from the ileo-caecal valve to
the rectum may constitute one vast tract of suppuration.Blood-vessels
may be opened by the necrotic process, and copious, even fatal,
hemorrhage may ensue.When pure blood is discharged, the hemorrhage
usually occurs in this way per rhexem, but the quantities of blood
evacuated with other elements usually escape per diapedesem.The cicatrization which results puckers the edges of the ulcers, and
may in cases of extensive or circular ulceration lead to more or less
stenosis of the intestinal tube.According to Rindfleisch, the scars of
dysenteric ulcers are very prone to contract, so that "the liability of
a subsequent stricture is directly proportionate to the extent of the
previous ulceration."The danger in these cases may be immediate from
entire, or more remote from partial, occlusion.Thus, Bamberger records
a case of {801} typhlitis due to impaction of feces above a stenosis
gradually developed from a dysenteric ulcer.Although dysentery is a disease of the large intestine, its lesions are
not exclusively limited to this structure.It is always a purely local
disease at first, and, strictly speaking, continues so throughout its
course, yet it produces in severe or chronic cases widespread and
general effects.Rapid emaciation sets in, and anaemia is soon
pronounced in all the internal organs.The mesenteric glands show signs
of irritation or of absorption of specific products in hyperaemic
pigmentation and hyperplasia.The kidneys in acute cases exhibit venous
stasis, and in chronic cases may undergo parenchymatous change.The
joints are peculiarly liable to suffer in certain cases, and the
nervous system may exhibit lesions--points to be described in the
symptomatology of the disease.Should pyaemia occur, it superimposes
its own particular lesions in the serous membranes and internal organs.All of these affections are to be regarded, however, rather as
complications than essential effects.But the liver is found affected so frequently in dysentery as to
constitute more than a mere coincidence.Schneider has recently (1873)
reported of the results of his observations on 1400 cases of tropical
dysentery that in the 395 post-mortem examinations the liver was found
normal in but 10 cases.The abnormalities were as follows: hyperaemia
of various grades, 160; fatty degeneration, 62; abscess, 57; nutmeg
liver, 47; perihepatitis, 25; granular atrophy, 19; syphilitic atrophy,
8; cicatrices, 6; excavation with helminth, 1.Berenger-Feraud (1883)
reports of 411 fatal cases of dysentery observed at Senegal that the
liver appeared sound to the naked eye 98 times (23 per cent.)and
diseased "undeniably" 313 times (77 per cent.).Of the 313 cases of
hepatic affection there were found--hypertrophy, softening, or
hyperaemia, 123 times (39 per cent.); abscess, 143 times (46 per
cent.); simple discoloration, 29 times (9 per cent.); atrophy or
cirrhosis, 18 times (6 per cent.).Annesley found abscess of the liver
21 times in 29 cases of dysentery; Hospel, 13 times in 25 cases; and
Budd found ulceration of the large intestine 10 times in 17 cases of
hepatic abscess.Gluck had the opportunity of making 28 post-mortem
examinations in 151 cases of dysentery in Bucharest, finding abscess of
the liver 16 times.All these authors adopt the explanation first
offered by Budd of direct transfer of diseased products through the
mesenteric and portal veins.But more extensive observation has developed the fact that the
frequency of abscess of the liver in connection with dysentery is a
peculiarity of tropical climates.In the temperate and colder regions
of the North this complication is not by any means so frequent.Frerichs declares that of 16 observations collected by Louis and
Andral, "ulcers were present in only 3, and in 2 of these cases the
ulcers were tubercular; of his own 8 cases, there was intestinal
affection in none."Gluck believes that the liver is more prone to show
suppuration when already predisposed to it by a preceding amyloid or
cirrhotic change of malarial origin.Eichhorst calls attention to the
well-known fact that abscess of the liver is especially a disease of
the tropics independently of dysentery, and the frequency of its
occurrence here may be a mere coincidence.But it must be remembered
that opportunity for post-mortem examination, upon the {802} results of
which these statistics are based, does not occur in the great majority
of cases of dysentery, and abscess of the liver is very often
overlooked.Thus, Schneider cites cases where persons with abscess of
the liver of the size of the head were considered simulants up to
twenty-four hours before death.Since the diagnosis of hepatic abscess
has been made so easy by aspiration, cases begin to multiply; and it is
doubtless the experience of most practitioners, in the temperate zone
at least, that the decided majority of cases of hepatic abscess
acknowledge an existing or previous attack of dysentery.Certainly, few
authors would now venture to subscribe to the view of Annesley, that
the abscess of the liver was the primary malady and was the cause of
the dysentery.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Dysentery, as stated, begins, as a rule, with the
general signs of a gastro-intestinal catarrh.So frequent is this mode
of inception, and so few are the exceptions, that it is impossible to
resist the conclusion that the disease is caused by the introduction of
a noxious element into the alimentary canal.The irritation thus
induced begins at the stomach, and is rapidly propagated throughout the
whole tract of the intestine.In the course of a few days the cause of
the disease becomes strictly localized to the large intestine, whose
greater capacity and more sluggish movement fit it for the easier
reception and longer retention of noxious matter.But specific dysentery and the more intense forms of catarrhal
dysentery occasionally exhibit distinctive symptoms from the start, and
in rarer cases the disease is suddenly announced with such tempestuous
signs as to excite the suspicion of poisoning.Thus, a case (one of
five lighter cases) is reported from the Rudolfstiftung in Vienna
(1878) where the disease closely simulated Asiatic cholera, and where
it rapidly ran a fatal course, in spite of laudanum, soda-water, ice
pills, mustard plasters, injections of amyl nitrite, camphor, and
ether, and faradization of the phrenic nerve to stimulate the failing
respiration.Finger reports similar cases from the hospital at Prague.Ordinarily, the peculiar pains of dysentery first proclaim the
character of the disease.The severe grinding, twisting pains, tormina,
are more or less localized in the course of the colon, and hence
surround or traverse the entire abdomen, the pains at the epigastrium
being due to spasmodic contractions of the transverse colon.The
patient in vain adopts various postures in relief or sits with his
hands firmly compressing the abdominal walls.The tormina are more or
less intermittent or remittent, and are usually experienced in greatest
severity toward evening.During their acme the face wears the aspect of
the intense suffering, which is expressed in outcries and groans.At
the same time there is upon pressure over the whole abdomen more or
less tenderness, which soon comes to be especially localized at the
caecum or sigmoid flexure.The tenesmus (cupiditas egerendi) is a more distressing, and certainly
more distinctive, sign of dysentery.It is the feeling of heavy weight
or oppression, of the presence of a foreign body in the rectum, which
demands instant relief.At the same time intense heat is felt in the
rectum, which the patient likens sometimes to the passage of a red-hot
iron.The desire of evacuation becomes as frequent as urgent.In
well-marked cases the patient sits at stool half an hour or an hour at
a time, straining until faint {803} and exhausted, leaving the commode
with reluctance, only immediately or very soon to use it again.Great depression is felt at the stomach at the same time, with nausea,
occasionally with vomiting; and strangury, with the discharge of only a
few drops of scalding urine or blood from the bladder, adds additional
suffering to the disease.Retraction of the testicle and prolapsus ani,
especially in children, are prone to occur in severe cases.But neither the pain nor the prostration is so characteristic of
dysentery as the stools, which, though of very varied nature, are
nevertheless distinctive.After the discharge of the intestinal
contents the first evacuations consist of mucus in the form of glairy,
stringy matter, like the white of an egg, expressed as the result of
the violent efforts at straining.The mucus may be pure or tinged with
blood, but it is usually very scant in quantity, and stands in this
regard in marked contrast with the violence of the efforts to secure
its extrusion.It is the frequency of its discharge which constitutes
an especial distress.Twenty to forty, even two hundred, times in the
twenty-four hours the patient must go to stool.In the worst cases the
patient sits at stool or lies upon the bed-pan the most of the day.The mucus is sooner or later mingled with pus or stained with blood.The presence of pus by no means necessarily implies the existence of
ulceration, as the apparently pure mucus always shows occasional white
blood-corpuscles under the microscope, and even extensive suppurations
occur without apparent solutions of continuity.The presence of blood is equally characteristic of dysenteric stools.Usually it is intimately commingled with the mucus or pus or forms the
chief element of the copious so-called bilious discharge.The
evacuation of pure blood indicates erosion of vessels low in the colon,
often in the rectum itself, though enormous quantities of blood are
sometimes voided from unbroken surfaces.Thus Lecard reports the case
of a soldier who "while sitting restless at stool lost one and a half
quarts of blood."The patient died on the fifth day of the disease, and
at the autopsy there was found "apoplectiform congestion from the
ileo-caecal valve to the anus, but no ulcers anywhere, nor any broken
vessels."Besides the mucus, pus, and blood, the dysenteric stools contain the
sloughs which have been torn off by violent peristalsis in cases of the
diphtheritic form.Usually they are separated in shreds and fragments,
but occasionally large sheets, even casts of a section of the colon,
are voided en masse.These were the cases considered by the older
authors to be detachments of the mucous membrane itself.As already
observed, these fragments consist for the most part of inspissated
mucus, pus, blood, and tissue-debris; but there is no doubt that in
some cases partially necrosed mucosa also enters into their
construction.One enormous tubular cast fourteen inches long, preserved
in our Army Medical Museum, was found to be "composed of
pseudo-membranous lymph in which no traces of the structure of the
mucous membrane could be detected" (Woodward).There still remains to be mentioned the boiled-sago or frogs'-spawn
matter whose origin has given rise to such a curious mistake.Not
infrequently these vitreous-looking bodies compose the bulk of the
sediment in the stools of dysentery, and even some of our modern
authors, {804} unacquainted with the more searching investigations of
Virchow, have regarded them as expressed contents of intestinal
follicles.Virchow found that under the application of iodine they
always assumed a blue color, whereupon he ironically remarks that the
sago-like mucus is really mucus-like sago.They are simply granules of
starch ingested as food, to remain partially or wholly undigested.The scybalae, the composite matter known as the lotura carnea, and the
micro-organisms found in the stools have already received mention
elsewhere.Although the stools of dysentery are scant, as a rule, they are so
frequent as to discharge during the entire twenty-four hours a very
large quantity of albuminous matter.Oesterlen has made the curious
calculation to show that the mean daily loss of albuminates in
dysentery of moderate intensity is from 50 to 60 grammes during the
first fourteen days, and on an average about 20 grammes during the next
eight days.The total loss experienced in an attack of three weeks'
duration thus amounts to about 1000 grammes--in rough figures, two
pounds avoirdupois.The rapidity with which emaciation, hydrops, and
marasmus occur in severe cases is thus easily accounted for.Nagele
speaks of cases where patients were reduced to skeletons in eight to
fourteen days, so that the convalescence extended over six weeks to
eight months.The alteration in the character of the secretion in dysentery is not
confined to the mucous membrane of the large intestine.On the
contrary, all the digestive juices are changed, in some cases entirely
checked.In the graver cases the saliva takes on an acid reaction and
loses its glycogenic properties; the gastric juice in the same cases
becomes alkaline and loses its peptonizing properties; while the
secretion of the bile is wholly arrested.Uffelmann, who had the rare
opportunity of studying the secretion of bile in a case of biliary
fistula, relates that during an attack of dysentery the bile ceased
entirely to flow, and only began to show itself again, at first
greenish, then greenish-brown, finally brown, during the process of
resolution on the ninth day of the disease.The anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting which so often mark the access or attend the course of
dysentery find thus easy explanation.Should the disease continue, the general strength of the patient
becomes so profoundly reduced as to resemble the status typhosus.The
tongue, which has been hitherto thickly coated, now becomes black,
shows fissures, and bleeds, while the gums are covered with sordes.The
pulse becomes feeble, thready, or barely perceptible.The skin is dry
and harsh or scaly.The abdomen is tumid or collapsed, the anus
paralyzed, and the discharges continuously ooze out to excoriate the
perineum.While the brain is usually clear throughout the disease,
insomnia, stupor, or coma develop in the gravest cases from absorption
of disease-products (Senator), or death suddenly ensues from heart-clot
or from thrombus of the venous sinuses of the dura mater (Busey).Pyaemia announces itself with a series of chills, followed by irregular
temperature, by the speedy occurrence of multiple abscesses in distant
organs, venous thromboses, affections of the serous membranes,
pleuritis, pericarditis, and embolic pneumonia.Gangrene of the
intestine, which may occur as early as the third day of the disease
(Nagele), is evidenced by the signs of general collapse.{805} COMPLICATIONS AND SEQUELAE.--The lighter cases of dysentery, as
well as most of the grave cases, run their entire course without
complication, and often without sequelae.But a certain percentage of
cases is attended with complications on the part of the joints
(rheumatism), of the nervous system (paralysis), and on the part of the
liver and the kidneys.Arthritis, when it occurs, shows itself, as a rule, in the second week
of the disease (Eichhorst), or after the disease has run its course,
during the period of convalescence (Huelte).That it is not a mere
coincidence is evidenced by the fact that it is present in a large
number of cases in certain epidemics, while it is not present
independently of dysentery.Thus, Braun of Stannenheim saw in the two
epidemics of 1833-34 more than forty cases of rheumatism, and Huelte
reports ten cases observed by himself in the epidemic at Montargis in
1854.Certain epidemics are distinguished by the rarity of this
complication, while most are marked by its absence altogether.In the
epidemic at Rahden (1872), 400 cases among 3800 inhabitants, Rapmund
saw inflammation of the joints set in only six times; and the entire
absence or extreme rarity of it in later epidemics have led most
physicians to deny any connection between the diseases, or to regard
the joint affection as incident to a complicating scorbutus or
neuralgia.All authors who admit it describe the knee-joint as being
the most frequent seat of the affection, but acknowledge that it is
mostly polyarticular; while there is much difference of opinion whether
it ever presents the general signs of true rheumatism--pyrexia,
diaphoresis, or its complications on the part of the heart.Huelte
maintains that it does not, and that it is allied to gonorrhoeal
rheumatism in this respect, while Eichhorst states that it may not only
show all these signs, but may be followed in exceptional cases by
suppuration and ankylosis.It usually lasts four to six weeks, but
neither its occurrence nor its severity stands in any relation to the
intensity of the attack of dysentery.It is probably to be regarded as
a manifestation of a light pyaemia or septicaemia, as it is a frequent
manifestation of this condition in or after scarlatina, puerperal
fever, and the septic fevers of surgery.Paralysis has been observed to occur after dysentery ever since the
days of Galen, and, disregarding the observations of ancient and of the
older periods of modern times, we find occasional records of cases in
our own days.Leyden,[6] in reporting a case of paresis and rheumatic
pains following an attack of dysentery, says that although
post-dysenteric paralysis is now rarely mentioned, it was frequent in
the older reports, and claims it as an admitted fact that it occurs not
at all infrequently now.Joseph Frank quotes some observations of this
kind, and refers especially to the dissertation of Fabricius.[7] These
paralyses, Fabricius observes, have been seen after the premature
suppression of malignant epidemics of dysentery by opiates and
astringents.Observations were afterward recorded by Graves in which
paralysis occurred after colics and inflammation of the intestines; and
English veterinary surgeons mention the fact that paralytic weakness of
the posterior extremities of horses and cattle follow attacks of
intestinal inflammation.The paralysis, when it occurs, is usually
confined to the lower extremities, but may extend to {806} and involve
the upper extremities, by preference in the form of paralysis
transversa (opposite arm and leg).Brown-Sequard attributes it to
reflex contraction of the blood-vessels; Jaccoud, to exhaustion of the
nerve-centres; and Roser, to the contact of the inflamed transverse
colon with the solar plexus.Remak first suggested the idea of an
ascending neuritis--a view which would seem to be corroborated by the
paralysis observed after the experiments, by Lewisson, of crushing the
uterus, kidneys, bladder, or loop of intestine, and which finds
additional support, as Leyden remarks, in the length of time which
lapses before it appears.Landouzy[8] says that Finger found diffuse
myelitis in a patient affected with paralysis supervening upon cancer
of the intestine, and that Delioux and Savignac saw spots of softening
in the cervical and lumbar region of the cord in the case of a man
affected with post-dysenteric paralysis.Weir Mitchell suggests the
possibility of other factors--long marches, malaria, bad diet, and
injuries to the spine--in the genesis of the cases, mostly paraplegias,
observed by him; and Woodward calls attention to lead-poisoning (as by
treatment) in explanation of a certain number of cases.[Footnote 6: "On Reflex Paralysis," _Volkmann's Sammlungen_.][Footnote 7: _Paralysis seu hemiplegia transversa resolutionem brachii
unius et pedis alterius exhibet_, Helmstedt, 1750.][Footnote 8: _Des Paralysies dans les Maladies aigues_.]Abscess of the liver gives rise to few distinctive symptoms, and is
mostly recognized or suspected, in the absence of positive signs, by
the persistence or obstinacy of the dysentery.The ease and impunity
with which aspiration may be performed in its recognition justifies the
use of it in every doubtful case.Regarding complications on the part of the kidneys, Zimmerman
recognizes four classes of cases: (1) mild cases, showing no albumen
and no casts; (2) severe, long-continued cases, with putrid stools,
status nervosus, and collapse, showing albumen; (3) cases commencing
with nervous symptoms, paralysis, scanty urine, showing kidneys filled
with exudation-cells and detritus; and (4) cases of speedy renal
complication and death.To these may be added the cases of protracted
chronic dysentery with long-continued suppuration, entailing the
possibility, of really rare actual occurrence, of amyloid degeneration
and chronic parenchymatous change (Bartels).Dysentery may be further complicated by parotitis; by venous thrombosis
(phlegmasia dolens); by diphtheritic deposits on other mucous surfaces,
which Virchow declares to be exceedingly rare; and by hydrops, which is
oftener a concomitant of the period of convalescence.Besides the deformities of the colon, which may ensue as a consequence
of ulceration or peritonitis, a long attack of dysentery is apt to
leave a hyperaesthetic or non-resistant state of the mucous surface, so
that every imprudence in exposure or in diet begets an intestinal
catarrh or a relapse of the disease.DIAGNOSIS.--When dysentery presents itself with its whole train of
symptoms the recognition of the disease is very easy.The tormina and
tenesmus, the peculiar discharges, the rapid reduction of strength,
leave no doubt as to the nature of the affection.The prevalence of an
epidemic of the disease will often establish the character of a case
even when all the signs are not present or when anomalies occur.Embarrassment in diagnosis only attends the recognition of catarrhal or
isolated cases, and in these cases there may be a doubt as between
dysentery and {807} diarrhoea--if such a symptom can be called a
disease--or typhoid fever, cholera, or some purely local affection of
the rectum, cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.In children difficulty of
diagnosis may arise as between dysentery and intussusception.Dysentery is differentiated from that lighter form of intestinal
catarrh whose main symptom is diarrhoea by the presence of tenesmus in
dysentery, as well as by its mucous, muco-purulent, diphtheritic, and
bloody discharges.Dysentery lasts longer than diarrhoea as a rule, and
does not yield so readily to treatment.Typhoid fever shows from the start brain symptoms, which are absent
from dysentery; has a typical temperature-curve, whereas there may be
no fever in dysentery, or, if any, of irregular remittent type; is
often prefaced by epistaxis and attended with bronchitis, both of which
are absent in dysentery; and exhibits ochre- pea-soup stools,
altogether different from those of dysentery.Cholera morbus distinguishes itself from dysentery by its sudden onset,
its profuse vomiting and discharges, its violent cramps, and the speedy
collapse.Cancer of the rectum can be usually felt, and hemorrhoids can be always
seen, so that no difficulty should be experienced in the recognition of
these cases.Intussusception occurs mostly in children, and has, in common with
dysentery, vomiting, mucous or bloody stools, colic, tenesmus, nervous
unrest, and prostration, so that a differential diagnosis may be
impossible for a few days.The more strict localization of an
intussusception, which may sometimes be felt as a sausage-like mass,
most frequently in the right ileum and hypochondrium, the greater
frequency and persistency of the vomiting and pain, the presence
visibly or palpably of the invaginated gut at the anus or rectum, soon
enable the careful examiner to recognize the case.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of dysentery varies between extremes.Some
cases are so mild as to merit the remark of Sydenham concerning certain
cases of scarlet fever: "Vix nomen morbi merebantur."They terminate of
themselves under favorable hygiene without especial treatment.On the
other hand, no known disease has a more frightful mortality than
dysentery in some of its epidemics, especially in army-life.It was
this class of cases which Trousseau had in mind when he called
dysentery the most murderous of all diseases.Sixty to eighty may be
the appalling percentage of death in these cases.Under favorable surroundings the average mortality of dysentery amounts
to 5-10 per cent., but is much influenced by the age and the general
condition of the patient, as well as by the complications which occur
in its course.Thus, Sydenham said of it over two hundred years ago,
"It is not infrequently fatal to adults, and still more so to old men,
but is nevertheless exceedingly harmless to infants, who will bear it
for months together without suffering, provided only Nature be left to
herself."But dysentery is by no means always harmless to infants, for
in some epidemics this period of life has been visited with the
greatest severity.Thus, Pfeilstucker reports of Wurtemberg (1873-74)
that the greatest mortality, 39 per cent., occurred at the age of one
to seven years, and the least, 4 per cent., at the age of thirty-one to
fifty years; {808} and Oesterlen says of England that dysentery causes
20 per cent.of deaths from all causes in the first year of life.Nor does the prevalence of a greater number of cases necessarily imply
a heavier mortality.For Bianchi reports of Rome that cases of
dysentery constituted but 2.28 per cent.of all the admissions into the
Ospedale di San Spirito in 1873, while in 1874 the percentage increased
to 3.68; yet the mortality of 1873 was 17.02 per cent., while that of
1874 was but 9.09 per cent.Complications on the part of the nervous system, the status typhosus,
pyaemia, and great prostration, necessarily render the prognosis grave,
yet even these cases are not necessarily fatal.Thus, Jules Aron
reports from the epidemic at Joigny (1876) a case of recovery after
complete paralysis of the sphincter ani.The recognition and discharge
of an hepatic abscess relieves the patient from the dangers of this
complication.Peritonitis alarmingly aggravates the prognosis, and
perforation is almost of necessity fatal.PROPHYLAXIS.--The improved sanitation of modern times has already
diminished the frequency and mitigated the severity of epidemics of
dysentery; and this fact, which is only an accidental observation as it
were, gives the clue to the means of its further prevention.The selection of proper sites for camping-grounds, barracks, and
hospitals, the prevention of overcrowding in tenement-houses, ships,
and jails, the regulation of sewage, the care for the food and drink,
the observation of the strictest cleanliness by authoritative
control,--all these are general measures which suggest themselves in
the prophylaxis of this or any disease.In the management of individual cases the first precaution is to
prevent the dissemination of the disease.Whether it be really
contagious or not, every case should be managed, as Bamberger suggests,
as though it were contagious; and this protection of others secures for
the individual patient the most favorable hygiene.The bedding must be frequently changed; the windows kept open to secure
free ventilation, which, in the light of existing knowledge, is the
only true disinfectant; and all the furniture of the sick-room,
especially including the receptacles for the discharges, must be kept
perfectly clean.For this purpose the best purifier is very hot water.The temperature of the sick-chamber, if it be subject to regulation,
should never be allowed to sink below or rise above 65-70 degrees F.

The drinking-water should be secured, during an epidemic, from the
purest possible source, and if good drinking-water cannot be had, what
there is should be thoroughly boiled.The discharges should properly be mixed with sawdust or some
combustible substance and burned, or if this be impracticable should be
buried in the soil a few feet below the surface, and not emptied into
water-closets or privy-vaults used by others.Such articles of food should be abjured as have a tendency to produce
intestinal catarrh.So unripe fruits, vegetables which readily undergo
fermentation--in short, all indigestible substances--should stand under
ban.But no prohibition should be put upon ripe fruits or simple
nutritious food of any kind.Lastly, individuals should protect themselves from catching cold.The
{809} researches of Pasteur have disclosed the fact that certain germs
of disease will grow and multiply in the body of an animal whose
temperature is reduced, when they would not increase without it.TREATMENT.--The first requisite in the treatment of an individual case
is perfect rest.Patients with even the lighter forms of catarrhal
dysentery should observe the recumbent posture, and cases of more
serious illness should be put to bed.Rest in bed, an exclusive diet of
milk--which should always have been boiled--and the time of a few days
is sufficient treatment for the mildest cases.Where there is objection
to milk, meat-soups, with or without farinaceous matters, rice, barley,
etc., may take its place.A case which is somewhat more severe will require perhaps a light
saline laxative--a Seidlitz powder, a dose of Rochelle salts or Epsom
salts in broken doses--or a tablespoonful of castor oil or five to ten
grains of calomel, to effect a cure.For the relief of the pain of the
lighter cases nothing is equal to tincture of opium, of which five to
ten drops every three or four hours in a tablespoonful of camphor-water
acidulated with a few drops of nitric acid will generally suffice; or
Dover's powder in broken doses, one to three grains, with five to
fifteen grains of bismuth or soda, or both, is a good substitute for a
change.The successful treatment of dysentery in any form depends upon a
recognition of the fact that the disease is local as to its seat, and
is probably specific as to its cause.The anodynes relieve the effects,
but the laxatives remove the cause.Consequently, the most rational
treatment of the severer cases is the irrigation of the large intestine
and the thorough flushing out of its contents.The use of clysters in
the treatment of dysentery dates from the most ancient times, with the
object, however, rather of medicating than washing out the bowel.O'Beirne (1834) and Hare (1849) were the authors of the irrigation
treatment, which they executed by means of a long tube introduced into
and beyond the sigmoid flexure.Since Hegar has recently shown how the
whole tract of the large intestine can be thoroughly inundated and
flushed with a common funnel and rectal tube, the practice has
continually gained ground, until it is now admitted as the most
valuable method of treatment.H. C. Wood of Philadelphia, and later
Stephen Mackenzie of London, have reported a number of cases in which
irrigation of the bowel with large injections medicated with nitrate of
silver, drachm j-pint j, was attended with the most surprising
results--sometimes but a single injection effecting a cure; and the
writer of this article has reported one case almost in articulo mortis
where complete cure followed the irrigation of the bowel--on three
occasions with three pints of water containing three drachms of common
alum.This case was all the more instructive from the fact that a
relapse had occurred after very striking but only temporary relief had
been obtained with the nitrate of silver, the alum having been
substituted simply on the ground of expense.Salicylic acid has also been extensively employed in this way with the
best effects, but carbolic acid has been discarded since the reports of
several cases of poisoning have been published.Should it become a
question of the necessity of a parasiticide, the bichloride of mercury
in extremely dilute solution, 1 to 1000, would be the agent par
excellence; but it is probable that the simple flushing of the bowel is
the chief {810} curative agent.The use of alum is not attended with
the dangers which have ensued from the absorption of carbolic acid, and
which might ensue from the bichloride of mercury.The water used in the
injections should always be cold.Ice-water injections alone give at
times the greatest relief.Wenzel uses injections of ice-water in all
recent and acute cases, whether slight or severe--in bad cases every
two hours.The object is to
introduce as much water as possible without producing too much pain.The large intestine of an adult holds, on an average, six imperial
pints, but in the author's experience not more than three or four pints
can be safely introduced.The patient should lie upon the back or the
left side with the hips elevated and the head low, while the injection
is slowly introduced from a funnel, fountain, or a bulb syringe whose
nozzle is thoroughly anointed with vaseline.In the absence of a
thoroughly competent assistant the operation should be performed by the
physician himself, for the proper use of an irrigating enema is a
practice which requires both judgment and skill.When pain is
experienced, the further influx of the fluid should cease for a few
minutes, when it may be resumed again and again until the largest
possible quantity is introduced.It is impossible to over-estimate the
value of this treatment in cleansing, disinfecting, and constringing
the foul and flabby surface of the whole seat of the disease.As was
said by Hare, "It changes a huge internal into an external abscess, and
enables us to cleanse the bowel of its putrid contents."Of all the remedies which have been recommended in the relief of
dysentery besides the irrigation method, but one, ipecacuanha, deserves
the name of a specific.This remedy was first introduced into practice
in 1648 by the botanist Piso, who was led to adopt it from the popular
praise he had heard of it while travelling in Brazil.He considered it
the most exquisite gift of nature, and administered it in infusion
according to the Brazilian (subsequently known as the French) method.Legros made three successive voyages to South America to import
supplies of the drug to France, but neither he nor the French merchant
Grenier, who had brought over more than one hundred and fifty pounds of
it, could secure its general use.Thereupon, Grenier acquainted Adrian
Helvetius, a Dutch physician practising in Paris at the time, with the
wonderful virtues of the Radix dysenterica, who, having experimented
with it first upon patients of the lower classes, was later successful
in curing the Dauphin of France.The further use of it, by permission
of the king, at the Hotel Dieu, enabled him to secure a monopoly of its
sale and secured for him a grant of a thousand pounds.Grenier hereupon
put in his claim for a division of the profits, and upon the refusal of
Helvetius instituted suit to obtain his rights.Justly indignant at the
loss of his suit, he revealed the secret, and ipecacuanha became common
property at once.Extravagant ideas were now entertained of its value,
but in the extreme reaction which followed every virtue of it was
disavowed, so that the drug came to be almost forgotten.From this
temporary oblivion the remedy was rescued by an English army surgeon,
E. Scott Docker, in 1858, who administered it, in combination with
laudanum, in his regiment, on the island of Mauritius, in all cases and
stages of the disease with such success that out of fifty cases he lost
but one.Although such indiscriminate use and such almost unvaried
success has not attended, and from the nature {811} of different cases
could not attend, its universal employment, there is no doubt of the
inestimable value of the service rendered in the restoration of the
remedy in the treatment of dysentery.Yet over twenty years elapsed
before its author received from his country, at the urgent solicitation
of the Director-General, in recognition of this service, a grant of
four hundred pounds.Remarkable testimony as to its efficiency soon began to appear.Ewart[9] recommends ipecacuanha in every form and type of acute
dysentery, as well as in the acute attacks supervening upon chronic
cases.Its advantages are simplicity, safety, comparative certainty,
promptitude of action, decrease of chronic cases and of complications,
especially abscess of the liver, and great reduction of mortality."It
produces all the benefits that have been ascribed to bloodletting,
without robbing the system of one drop of blood; all the advantages of
mercurial and other purgatives, without their irritating action; all
the good results of antimony and other sudorifics, without their
uncertainty; all the benefits ascribed to opium, without irritating, if
not aggravating or masking, the disease."To the objections urged
against it he replies that the nausea is only temporary and
evanescent--that vomiting is exceptional and of but short duration;
moreover, it permits nourishment and assimilation and produces sleep.If uncontrollable sickness and vomiting occur, they are probably due to
abscess of the liver, malaria, some other cachexia, Bright's disease,
strumous mesenteric glands, hypertrophy of the spleen, peritonitis, or
extensive sloughing.[Footnote 9: _Indian Annals Med.Cunningham prefaces the treatment by a sinapism to the epigastrium and
half a drachm of the tincture of opium.Then from one to one and a half
drachms of ipecacuanha are administered in powder.It causes
considerable nausea, and vomiting occurs in one to two hours.During
the nausea copious perspiration breaks out, the pulse becomes fuller,
softer, and less frequent, the tenesmus and abdominal pains cease, and
the patient has no more stools for twelve to twenty-four hours.The
next evacuation is easy, fluid, but free from blood or mucus.Sometimes
the dose of ipecacuanha may require to be repeated.Malun reports the results of treatment of 436 cases occurring in
twenty-one months.There were only 6 deaths, and in only 1 of these
could the remedy be fairly said to have failed.Under all other plans
of treatment the mortality has varied from 12 to 22.3 per cent.Docker says that the mortality of dysentery in the British army
during the ten years that followed the adoption of the ipecacuanha
treatment fell from 11 to 5 per cent.The remedy is best administered in large doses, 20 to 40 grains, and
should be repeated every four to twelve hours until permanent good
effects are secured.A dose of 15 to 30 drops of tincture of opium, or
morphia, one-fourth grain hypodermically, will best protect the patient
from too great exhaustion.The beneficial results are mostly obtained
in the acute cases, though surprising results sometimes follow in cases
of very long standing.Thus, Gayton records a case of severe chronic
dysentery of eighteen months' duration which was entirely cured by
ipecacuanha, and probably most physicians of large practice can recall
cases where the continual relapses of the dysenteric habit have been
completely broken up by {812} one course of active treatment.Should
the remedy fail to be of service in the course of forty-eight hours, it
should be discontinued.Batiator, the bark of the root of the Ailanthus glandulosa; mudar, the
bark of the root of the Calotropis gigantea; and bael-fruit, more
especially in chronic cases,--have been proposed by Roberts, Duval,
Chuckerbutty, and others as substitutes for ipecacuanha, but are not
likely to soon supplant it.Materia medica is rich in drugs whose virtues have been vaunted in
dysentery, and cases occur where the judicious physician will make his
selection according to the indications in a given case.Turpentine
internally, as well as externally in the form of a stupe (Copland), has
had advocates from ancient times; astringents, tannic acid or the
substances which contain it, kino, catechu, krameria; the acetate of
lead, nitrate of silver, etc.; antiseptics, carbolic acid, salicylic
acid, boracic acid; anodynes, opium and its preparations; and
quinia,--are among the agents most frequently employed.Bonjean (1870) had occasion to laud the efficacy of ergotin in checking
hemorrhage and controlling the discharges in a report which
substantiates the claim of Rilliet and Lombard in the epidemic at
Geneva in 1853.Massolez had the same good results in the war of the
Crimea, as had also Andrea in the Spanish hospitals of Ceuta and
Tetuan.Clysters of nitrate of silver, 4 grains to 5 ounces of water (Duchs),
or with a few drops of tincture of opium (Berger); of ipecacuanha
(Begbie and Duckworth); of laudanum and starch (Sydenham, Abercrombie);
of the various astringents,--may be tried in obstinate, more especially
chronic, cases.Local inspection of the rectum by means of the speculum may possibly
reveal an ulcer, which is the chief or sole cause of the tenesmus and
bloody discharge.Maury reports such a case in which the ulcer was deep
enough to hide a small sponge.In such cases topical treatment may
effect a cure.Dilatation may suffice to overcome a stricture in the rectum, the
result of cicatricial contraction, or colotomy may be necessary in
cases more refractory or situated higher in the bowel.Post[10]
reported a successful colotomy, with the formation of an artificial
anus in the left lumbar region, in such a case.The food should be fluid, but nutritious, and milk best fulfils both
these requisites.Where milk cannot be tolerated it may be substituted
by soups, beef-tea, mutton-broths, chicken-soup, etc.But it should be
known of these substitutes that they contain little or no nutritious
matter on account of the insolubility of the albuminoids, and are
really only stimulants.Soft-boiled egg, thin custards, sweetbreads,
scraped or chopped raw beef--albumen thus in substance--constitute the
best food.But during the intensity of an attack the patient should
almost altogether abstain from food, both from lack of inclination for
it and from lack of ability to digest it.During convalescence the food
should be on the basis of animal diet, though ripe fruits and fresh
succulent vegetables should not be altogether withheld.In all cases of pronounced prostration stimulants are to be freely
used, and of all stimulants alcohol is the best, as it has also
nutritive and {813} antiseptic properties.Alcohol is thus triply
indicated in the treatment of dysentery, but the choice of the form and
strength will be a matter of judgment in the individual case.Where life is imperilled by hemorrhage or anaemia from any cause, a
forlorn hope is offered in transfusion, which in the hands of C.
Schmidt (1874) has proved successful in two cases.Abscess of the liver is best treated by aspiration or hepatotomy;
rheumatism, by the salicylates; and paralysis, by the constant current
of electricity.Obstinate cases of chronic or continually recurring dysentery are
thoroughly cured only by a sea-voyage, a sojourn at the seashore, a
mountain-excursion, or a permanent change of climate.{814}

TYPHLITIS, PERITYPHLITIS, PARATYPHLITIS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.HISTORY.--Typhlitis ([Greek: typhlos], blind), inflammation of or about
the head of the colon, more especially the vermiform process, is a
disease of modern recognition.Individual cases had been reported as
curiosities where foreign bodies or fecal accumulations had excited
inflammation in this part of the intestine, but it is undoubtedly to
Dupuytren[1] that the credit is due of having first individualized this
disease as a separate affection.About the same time (1827) Longer
Villermay published his communications in the _Archives gen._, t. v.246, on the diseases of the vermiform process, to be followed in the
same year by Melier[2] and Hussar and Dance with observations on
inflammation of the connective tissue in the region of the caecum.These affections, which had been hitherto described as inflammatory
tumors in the right iliac region, now received from Puchelt[3] the
distinct name perityphlitis.[Footnote 1: _Lecons oral de Cliniq.[Footnote 2: _Arch, gen._, Sept., 1827.][Footnote 3: _Heidelberg klin.Perhaps the most remarkable events in the history of these affections
since this time are the contributions of Stokes and Petrequin (1837) on
the value of opium in the treatment of perforation of the vermiform
appendix, of Albers,[4] who first distinguished the special form of
typhlitis stercoralis, and of Oppolzer (1858-64), who set apart,
perhaps as an unnecessary refinement in differential diagnosis, a
paratyphlitis, an inflammation of the post-caecal connective tissue.Matterstock[5] (1880) deserves especial mention for having given such
prominence to anomalies of the vermiform appendix in the etiology of
the affection; and Kraussold[6] (1881) has connected his name with the
therapy of the disease by the boldness with which he expresses his
convictions regarding the necessity of early evacuation, by incision,
of inflammatory products, as first practised by Willard Parker in 1843.aus dem Gebiete der Pathologie_, ii.[Footnote 5: _Handbuch d. Kinderkrank._, Bd.[Footnote 6: _Volkmann's Sammlung._, No.GENERAL REMARKS.--Typhlitis, strictly speaking, is limited to
affections of the caecum and its appendix vermiformis; perityphlitis is
mostly due to extension of the inflammation to the peritoneal envelope
of these organs; while paratyphlitis signifies an involvement of the
extra-peritoneal and post-caecal connective tissues.Both perityphlitis
and paratyphlitis are therefore secondary processes, though they may,
in exceptional cases, arise from affections of organs other than the
caecum, as from {815} perinephritis, psoitis, vertebral caries, or as
an expression of metastatic processes in pyaemia, septicaemia
(puerperal fever), typhoid fever, etc.ETIOLOGY.--Typhlitis and its allied affections or complications show
especial predilection for the male sex and the period of adolescence.Nearly three-fourths (733) of the whole number (1030) of cases of
perityphlitis collected from the literature by Matterstock were males,
and this proportion holds good in infancy and early youth as well as in
adolescence.The greatest number of cases, 33 per cent., occurred at
the ages of 21-30; next, 30 per cent., at 11-20; while the ratio
gradually decreases toward both extremes of life.So the opinion is
expressed with singular unanimity by all authors that these diseases
pre-eminently affect the bloom of life.The observation that typhlitis has so often been found to arise from
disease of the vermiform process has led to a closer study of its
anatomical relations, and developed the fact that this organ is subject
to great variation in size, shape, and situation.Normally, the appendix vermiformis arises from the posterior interior
aspect of the caecum as a tube of the diameter of a goosequill and a
length of three to six inches, with a general direction upward and
inward behind the caecum.It is commonly provided with a small
mesentery, which retains it in its place.Its cavity communicates with
the cavity of the caecum by a small orifice which is at times guarded
by a valvular fold of mucous membrane, while its free closed end
terminates abruptly in a blunt point.It is commonly found filled with
mucus throughout its entire length.The existence of this superfluous
structure, which is found only in man and certain of the higher apes,
has given rise to much speculation among the anatomists and
physiologists, especially of the teleological school, as to its
possible use.It is now, however, the generally acknowledged opinion
that the appendix vermiformis is a relic or rudiment of a subsidiary
stomach in lower forms of life.The head of the large intestine, which
forms almost an additional stomach in the Gramnivora, and is three
times the length of the whole body in the marsupial koala, is very much
reduced in the Carnivora, whose food contains but little indigestible
matter, and is greatly reduced in the Omnivora, as in man.The
vermiform appendix is the shrivelled remnant of the great caecal
receptaculum of the lower animals.In the orang it is still a long
convoluted tube, but in man it is reduced, as stated, to the size of a
quill three or four inches in length, and is often entirely absent.Kraussold, who complains that the vermiform process has hitherto
received only step-motherly treatment at the hands of anatomists and
clinicians, undertook a series of investigations which went to show how
often and what extreme anomalies do occur.In some cases the appendix
was disposed in an exactly opposite to the normal direction, its blind
end being turned upward along the ascending colon.In one case it was
found wound about the ileum; in another, spirally turned at its end and
lightly adherent to a hernial sac.Sometimes it was abnormally long or
short, open or closed with a valve, cylindrical, saccular, or bulbed,
fixed or free, curved or bent upon itself at a sharp angle, provided
with a short mesentery, and sometimes, as stated, it was entirely
absent.But by far the most interesting point connected with this organ was the
frequency with which it was found the seat of ulceration or stricture
{816} from cicatrization somewhere in its course, the result of
dysentery, typhoid fever, syphilis, and more especially of
tuberculosis.Clinicians who have been struck with the frequency with
which typhlitis has occurred in tuberculous subjects find in this
discovery a satisfactory explanation of this very remarkable
coincidence.Normally, the vermiform appendix is found filled, as stated, with a
tough vitreous mucus, but not infrequently masses of feces, foreign
bodies, intestinal worms, etc.find their way into it, where they may
remain innocuous or may excite a dangerous inflammation.This fact, in
connection with the general uselessness or superfluousness of this
structure, has led pathologists to characterize the vermiform process
with the significant appellation of a death-trap.Two anatomical factors deserve especial emphasis in explanation of the
frequent origin of disease in the vermiform appendix.One is the
existence of the valvular fold of mucous membrane, already mentioned,
at or near the orifice of the tube in the caecum, the clinical
importance of which was first pointed out by Gerlach.This fold is most
marked between the ages of three and twelve, and when pronounced
narrows the orifice to one-half or one-third of the whole calibre of
the tube.As a rule, this fold, and the consequent diminution in the
size of the orifice, are but little marked in the first years of life
and in old age, which accounts for the relative infrequency of
typhlitis at these periods of life.The second mechanical factor is the deformity caused by the abnormal
anatomical position of the organ, either as a congenital defect or as a
pathological change.Matterstock quotes from Zungel, who observed in 59
cases in the Hamburg hospital whole or partial obliteration 30 times,
catarrh and old fecal concretions 43 times, abnormal adhesions 12
times, and tubercular ulceration (without perforation) 11 times.Toft
claims as the result of 300 personal investigations that every third
person between the ages of twenty and seventy showed the traces of
present or past inflammation, and that actual ulceration existed in 5
per cent.Kraussold declares that this
percentage is rather too low than too high, and adds that among his
patients--who were, it should be stated, mostly phthisical--it was
remarkable how extraordinarily often the whole vermiform appendix was
the seat of an encroaching ulcer.In a number of cases cicatrices or
cicatricial alterations were found where typhoid fever or dysentery had
existed in the previous history.Attention should at least be called to a last anatomical factor in
explanation of the frequency of ulceration and inflammation of this
structure, in that its walls are so sparsely endowed with muscular
tissue as to render it unable to empty itself of the virus or germs of
disease which enter it from the comparatively stagnant reservoir, the
caecum.Constipation is usually invoked as a cardinal factor in the genesis of
typhlitis (typhlitis stercoralis).Speck calls attention to the
frequency of the disease in East Siberia, where the food, mostly
vegetable, contains a large amount of indigestible residue.But that
this condition cannot sufficiently account for the disease in most
cases is proved by the fact that constipation is more frequent in
advanced life and among females, in whom typhlitis with its associate
lesions is more infrequent.For the same reason a sedentary mode of
life loses force as an argument in its production.Perhaps the most
efficient cause of the condition is a local {817} paresis of the
muscular tissue of the caecum produced by the irritation of intestinal
catarrh, of disease virus, of a fecal concretion or a foreign body--an
irritation which may induce first a spasmodic action, and subsequently,
as a result, a partial paralysis or a paresis.The same condition may
be brought about more directly by the presence of a centre of
irritation--viz.Accumulation and
impaction of feces must then necessarily ensue, and it is highly
probable that this accumulation occurs in this way as a result more
frequently than as a cause of the condition.For the symptoms of a
simple accumulation of feces (coprostasis) are never so severe, at
least at the start, as to mark the onset of a genuine typhlitis.Nor is
there anything in healthy feces to induce the signs of a severe
blood-poisoning which so commonly announces the advent or course of
typhlitis.Room is here open for the surmise that most cases of typhlitis pur et
simple are due to the presence in the caecum of the germs or virus of
disease taken with the food or drink, and traversing innocuously the
whole length of the alimentary tract, to finally bring up in this most
stagnant part of the intestinal canal.The role of pure mechanical causes cannot be ignored or underrated in
perityphlitis, understanding by this division processes which commence
in the vermiform appendix.For it is the rule to discover in the
vermiform appendix in these cases either fecal concretions or foreign
bodies.Haeckel and Buhl found concretions of meconium in a new-born
child, and fecal concretions, intestinal stones, are far more
frequently encountered than foreign bodies.In 146 accurately observed
adult cases recorded by Matterstock, fecal concretions were met with 63
times, foreign bodies 9 times, while in the other cases nothing could
be discovered; and in 49 cases among children, fecal concretions were
discovered 27 times, foreign bodies 3 times, and nothing abnormal in
the remaining cases.Not infrequently a small foreign body acts as a
centre of crystallization for feces which become superimposed in
successive layers.Hairs, as of the beard, sometimes officiate in this
way.Among other foreign bodies met with in fatal cases of perforation,
independently of feces, may be mentioned round-worms (Faber),
cherry-stones (Paterson), needles (Payne), fish-bones (Zungel),
gall-stones (Hallete), a mass of ascarides (Klebs), buttons (Gerhardt),
etc., etc.As already intimated, supposed foreign bodies are often
found on examination to be nothing else than intestinal concretions.As
to cherry-stones, which are so often accused of producing typhlitis,
Biermer and Bossard found it difficult or impossible to force them into
the vermiform process.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions revealed upon the post-mortem table show
for the most part the ordinary picture of perforative peritonitis,
which is by far the most frequent cause of death.The peritoneum in the
vicinity of the perforation is found hyperaemic, swollen, necrosed,
covered with flakes of soft fibrin, or partially agglutinated to
contiguous structures.The wall of the bowel is very much thickened by
catarrhal swelling of its mucosa, proliferation of its submucous tissue
in more chronic cases, oedema of all its coats, or suppurative
processes.Not infrequently the mucous tissue is the seat of extensive
ulceration which may involve other structures of the gut or form an
abscess, even as large as a man's head, in its immediate vicinity.The
abscess may remain strictly localized or {818} may wander to discharge
itself into the ileum, caecum, duodenum, and diaphragm (Bamberger) with
resultant empyema (Duddenhausen), colon (Prudhomme), bladder (Bossard),
in which case the fecal concretion became the nucleus for a vesical
stone; acetabulum (Aubry), inferior vena cava (Demaux), or peritoneal
cavity, the most frequent eventuality.Duddenhausen saw in one case a
pylephlebitis result, Von Buhl a pylephlebitis and metastatic liver
abscess, which condition, Matterstock says, is noted 11 times in 146
autopsies; and older writers speak of discharges into the pleural sac,
into the lungs, pericardium, uterus, vagina, etc.A curious case was
observed by Eichhorst in Frerichs' clinic, where pus found escape
through the umbilicus.So cases of burrowing sinuses with abscesses at
distant seats, as in the groin or lumbar region, fistulae with
continuous discharge, and other curiosities, may be found among the
records by the curious.In cases of more acute course the lesions are often found centred about
the vermiform appendix.The most various contortions, adhesions, or
erosions are observed in this structure.Occasionally a constriction
occludes the course of the tube, while the distal end is dilated into a
condition of hydrops.It may be found perforated in one or in several
places.The cicatrices or agglutinations of old attacks may be
encountered; it may be cut in two or three pieces (Matterstock), or
have been entirely absorbed.Kraussold records a case of this kind in a
colleague who died of typhlitis.Upon the post-mortem table no trace of
the vermiform appendix could be encountered except a dimple on the
mucous surface of the caecum, indicating the site of its former
orifice.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Typhlitis announces itself in two ways--suddenly and
insidiously.In adults the disease begins as a rule with violent signs;
in children there is often a prodromatous stage which may last for days
or for months before a positive diagnosis can be established.There are
in these cases anorexia and vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea,
colicky pains, mostly concentrated about the ileo-caecal region.There
are at this time a disinclination to stand or walk, a stooped posture
or gait, occasionally a light icterus, a feeling of formication or
paresis in the right leg, and lastly an increased resistance or a
palpable tumor in the right ileum.In the adult the disease is wont to begin with more tempestuous signs.Not infrequently it is ushered in with a well-marked chill, upon which
immediately supervenes a sharp pain at the affected region.A general
collapse of strength soon follows, with fever, thirst, a husky voice, a
coated tongue, vomiting, singultus, and an expression of anxiety.The
impression of serious illness becomes apparent at once.The case early
bears the aspect of a grave infectious disease.A constant, dull,
boring, gnawing, or lancinating pain in the right iliac region first
excites the suspicion of the physician as to the real nature of the
disease.In children the pain is sometimes felt first in the
epigastrium; in three cases mentioned by Buchner, Herzfelder, and
Traube it was first experienced in the left ileum.There may be at this
time no tumor, but there is increased resistance to pressure and
exquisite tenderness to touch in the neighborhood of the caecum.The
whole abdomen is more or less tender, and often tumid.If there should
be also gurgling from displacement of gas, doubt is excited as to the
possible existence of typhoid fever.{819} In the course of a few days the tumor takes shape.A typhlitis
stercoralis shows a distension of the whole ascending colon, a
sausage-shaped tumor, smooth or nodulated, along the entire right side
of the abdomen, with increased resistance also in the transverse colon.More frequently in typhlitis--and, as a rule, in peri- and
paratyphlitis--the tumor or tumefaction is more localized about the
head of the colon.Frequently the swelling is so great as to be visible
as a protrusion or bulging of the affected region.Percussion shows
dulness, tanquam femoris, in cases of pure typhlitis, whereas in peri-,
and more especially in paratyphlitis, there is tympanites on light and
dulness only on deep percussion.Palpation or palpatory auscultation
occasionally, though very rarely, reveals a peritoneal friction sound
(Gerhardt).The third cardinal symptom of the disease is the disturbance of
digestion, which, as stated, often precedes or attends the first
manifestation of the pain and the tumor.Anorexia, nausea, and
vomiting--which is in the last stage of the disease often substituted
by singultus--present themselves as occasional or constant signs of the
disease.Constipation remains as a rule throughout the whole course of
the disease with an obstinacy which sometimes excites apprehension of
an intestinal occlusion; or the constipation may alternate with
diarrhoea or dysenteric phenomena, more especially in the earlier
stages.The tongue is, as a rule, heavily coated, or in typhoid states
is dry, glazed, or fissured, and sordes covers the teeth and gums.Fever is not a necessary factor in typhlitis, but when present
distinguishes itself by its irregular range.The pulse is usually
accelerated, full, and hard; the skin is dry and harsh; the urine is
scanty and high-, and contains "almost without exception
unusually large quantities of indican" (Eichhorst).Perforation, when it occurs, is usually recognized at once by the signs
of more or less immediate collapse, which quickly results in death.The abdomen becomes suddenly distended, meteoric over its entire
surface, the normal hepatic dulness giving place to a tympanitic
resonance.Not infrequently perforation occurs as the result of an accident, as
after a push or blow upon the abdomen (Volz), heavy lifting
(Volperling), riding in a wagon (Marsh), after dancing (Cless), mere
turning of the body in bed (Langdon Downs), after emesis (Urban),
purgation (Stokes), enema (Melier), etc., etc.That the slightest
agitation may suffice at times to break down the last barrier of serous
tissue separating the intestinal and peritoneal cavity is shown in the
case recorded by With, where fatal perforative peritonitis occurred
after a fit of immoderate laughter.Paratyphlitis distinguishes itself from the other forms of the disease
by its more insidious character.There is also in paratyphlitis, as a
rule, less disturbance in the alimentary canal.The caecum in
paratyphlitis is mostly empty or is filled with gas, whose presence is
recognized by tympanitic resonance on lighter percussion.On the other
hand, paratyphlitis is characterized by the greater frequency of
pressure signs in the right lower extremity.If the subjacent iliac and
psoas muscles be implicated, the thigh is flexed upon the leg in
decubitus.Various paraesthesiae, formication, numbness, pain, and
veritable paresis are experienced in the right leg.Dysuria, retraction
of the testicle, and priapism may also occur in this form of the
disease.Or pressure upon the iliac vein {820} induces thrombosis, with
oedema, milk leg.The long-continued process of suppuration in
paratyphlitis leads also at times to hectic fever or pyaemia, with slow
marasmus.In all cases relapses are very frequent, as repeated occurrences of the
disease constitute the rule.Eichhorst records the case of a
court-officer who suffered five attacks of paratyphlitis in the short
space of one and a half years.DIAGNOSIS.--The recognition of the disease is mostly simple.The pain,
the tumor, and the disturbances of digestion sufficiently, and for the
most part sufficiently early, distinguish the affection.Simple impaction of feces is differentiated by the history of
constipation; by the feel of the hardened feces, which form an
elongated, nodulated, sausage-shaped tumor along the entire ascending
colon, and later in shifting along the transverse colon; by the
comparatively slight tenderness; and by the entire relief which follows
thorough irrigation of the bowel.Cancer may be eliminated by regard of the age of the patient, the slow
development and course of the symptoms, and the gradual manifestation
of its cachexia.Invagination is an affection for the most part of early childhood--is
marked by the sudden appearance of violent symptoms of disturbance of
digestion, vomiting, often stercoraceous, occlusion, diarrhoea, or
dysentery, with straining and discharges of blood.DURATION.--Typhlitis and its complications have no definite duration.A
case may terminate fatally in the course of a few days or may extend
itself over months, or with its effects over years or for life.The
disease is, as a rule, much shorter in childhood than in adult life.According to Matterstock, nearly one-half (44 per cent.)of children
succumb to the disease within the first three days.Wood records the
case of a girl aged ten who died in nine hours.The average duration of
cases of typhlitis without suppuration ranges from fourteen to
twenty-one days.The early evacuation of inflammatory products by
aspiration or incision may cut the disease short at any time, or
exacerbations and remissions may manifest themselves for months or
years--a condition especially liable to occur when burrowing sinuses or
fistulae develop, or when passive encapsulated abscesses are aroused
into activity by some accident or indiscretion on the part of the
patient.PROGNOSIS.--A case of typhlitis stercoralis has no gravity, and should
terminate or be terminated within twenty-four to forty-eight hours
after its recognition.Neglected or unrecognized cases, however, are
not infrequently fatal from the circumscribed or more especially
diffuse peritonitis which may ensue.Typhlitis independent of fecal impaction is always a grave affection,
requiring in every instance a very guarded prognosis.Every form of typhlitis is more fatal in childhood than in adult life,
and any case of the disease may present grave complications or assume a
dangerous form at any time.The greater danger of childhood lies in the
greater liability to peritonitis.Most subsequent writers confirm this
statement, first made by Willard Parker, who also remarked that
suppurative processes, abscess formation, is more common in the adult.The mortality of perityphlitis alone in childhood is 70 per cent., in
adult life 30 per {821} cent., so that the proportion of recoveries is
exactly the reverse of these figures at the different periods of life.The general adoption of the opium treatment has, however, rendered the
prognosis of typhlitis far more favorable--has, in fact, reduced the
mortality in adult life from 80 per cent., the appalling figures of the
older statistics (Volz), to 30 per cent., the ratio of modern times.The means of earlier detection and readier relief of accumulated pus
have also contributed much to reduce the mortality of typhlitis.In
1872, Bull of New York had to report of 67 cases of perityphlitic
abscess collected by him, mostly treated without operation, a mortality
of 47-1/2 per cent., while ten years later (1882) Noyes of Providence
was able to report of 100 cases treated by operation a mortality of
only 15 percent.[Footnote 7: "Contribution to the Clinical Study of Typhlitis, etc.,"
_Trans.The development of fistulae or wandering abscess, the occurrence of
pyaemia and peritonitis, necessarily aggravate the prognosis of a
simple case.Perforation is fatal of necessity, yet cases are not
wanting where recovery has occurred even after this gravest of all the
accidents of the disease.Thus, Patschkrowski reports, from Frerichs'
clinic, a case of recovery after perforation, and Pepper mentions the
results of an autopsy made upon an old man who died of vesical
hemorrhage, in whom he "found that there had, at some unknown previous
time, been perforation of the appendix."PROPHYLAXIS.--The prevention of typhlitis has reference more especially
to cases of habitual recurrence of the disease in adults, or to the
earliest, prodromatous, stage in childhood.The slightest manifestation
of pain in the right iliac region should be looked upon with suspicion
in these cases, and absolute rest enjoined at once.Since in childhood
perforation has occurred in insidious cases after so slight an
irritation as a laxative or an enema, or even after a bath, every
provocation of this kind should be avoided.Injunction is to be put
upon all solid food in all cases in the inception as well as throughout
the course of the affection, that the element of coprostasis be not
superadded to the irritation of the disease.Adults subject to frequent
recurrences or relapses will thus avoid also the development or
aggravation of an intestinal catarrh, which in other cases of trivial
import may become dangerous to them.Many cases of typhlitis are
doubtless aborted at the start by the observance of absolute rest and
abstinence from food or rigid diet at the start.TREATMENT.--Perhaps no disease requires such careful consideration of
its cause or form, inasmuch as the different varieties call for
entirely different treatment.A typhlitis stercoralis, for instance,
requires an exclusive evacuant treatment, whereas a peri- or
paratyphlitis demands a treatment that shall put the bowels at rest.The safest and most effective method of emptying the caecum of impacted
feces is by irrigation of the bowels by means of the funnel syringe
devised by Hegar.The patient is put in the knee, elbow, or chest
posture, and warm water--which is the best solvent for hardened
feces--is allowed to slowly inundate the whole tract of the colon,
after the manner and with the precautions already pointed out in the
article on dysentery.Feeble or reduced patients should be supported in
this posture until as much water as possible is slowly introduced.As a
rule, a single thorough irrigation will suffice, or one or several
additional operations may be required {822} to secure the desired
effect.At the same time, broken doses, twenty grains, of sulphate of
magnesia may be administered every hour or two, not so much for the
purpose of exciting additional peristalsis as of turning water into the
intestinal canal from above.The other varieties of the affection call for opium at the start, with
the double view of preventing the irregular, spasmodic, or tetanic
contraction of the muscular coat and of obviating the danger of
peritonitis.Opium is not contraindicated in these cases, even if the
element of fecal impaction be superadded, as all clinicians are
familiar with the fact that the bowels will move of themselves at times
even under its full narcotic effects.The remedy is best given in fluid form, as in the tincture, that the
dose may be graduated in its repetition to secure its full effect
without danger.When a quick action is required, morphia hypodermically
may be preferred; yet it is to be remembered that opium with all its
active principles is of more value in the relief of peritonitis than
morphia alone.A careful watch should be kept upon all patients treated
with large or frequently-repeated doses of opium, that its toxic
effects be avoided.Not infrequently symptoms of poisoning have
supervened after a sudden relief of pain, necessitating the use of
means to keep the patient awake for a number of hours.Hot embrocations, or poultices applied over large surfaces of the
abdomen, give great comfort to the patient, though the very opposite
treatment of an ice-bag, occasionally shifted or suspended, is more
agreeable in some cases in the inception of the disease.So soon as a distinct doughy sensation or a more marked fluctuation
indicates the development of pus, steps should be undertaken at once to
secure its evacuation.In cases of doubt it is best to make a tentative
exploration with the needle of the aspirator, a large-sized needle
being preferred on account of the liability of occlusion with
tissue-shreds or other debris.It is quite surprising how rapidly a
case clears up at times after the evacuation of even only a drachm or
two of oedematous fluid.More frequently, however, the aspiration must
be repeated until a quantity of pus is secured and the abscess
completely discharged.An abscess of more superficial situation, of larger size, or of
continuous formation is best relieved by free incision.As to the time
of the operation, the old rule, ubi pus ibi incisio, holds good here as
elsewhere.An early evacuation of the products of inflammation prevents
the supreme danger of perforative peritonitis or the formation of
burrowing sinuses, fistulae, amyloid degeneration, and marasmus.Indurated tumors are sometimes made to soften under the long-continued
use of cataplasms, and chronic thickenings of the walls of the
intestine are relieved by general tonics, mild laxatives, mineral
waters, and gentle frictions with iodine or mercurial ointments.Perforative peritonitis calls for opium in maximum doses as a means of
facilitating possible agglutinations or encapsulations, and a forlorn
hope is offered in an early laparotomy, which the bolder surgeons are
now undertaking in the equally desperate cases of perforation by gall-
or kidney-stones, etc.Under no circumstances should a patient affected with typhlitis leave
the bed until the last trace of inflammation has subsided, as in no
disease is there greater liability to recurrence or relapse.{823}

INTESTINAL ULCER.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.Intestinal ulcer, Ulcus intestinorum entero-helcosis ([Greek:
helchosis], ulcer), represents a solution of continuity in the wall of
the intestine, affecting first, as a rule, its mucous coat.Ulcer of
the intestine, like ulcer of the stomach, its occasional congener and
not infrequent associate, is the expression of an insult or injury
offered to the intestinal coat in its inner exposed surface, or of a
necrobiosis the result of a local occlusion in the general
blood-supply.Hence, ulcer of the intestine may be a purely local
disease, or be the local expression of a general, so-called
constitutional, disease.While in many cases the lines differentiating
these conditions may not be distinctly drawn, as many so-called
constitutional conditions (tuberculosis, typhoid fever, etc.)are
discovered to be--at first, at least--local processes, the toxic ulcer
(arsenic, mineral acids) may be taken as a type of the local process,
acting from within, and the syphilitic ulcer as the type of the general
process, acting from without.At the same time, it must be recognized
of syphilis that an ulcer may result from the dissolution or breaking
down of a gummatous mass anywhere in the course of the intestine, or
may be the effect of infection by extension into the rectum of
syphilitic processes about the genital organs, or, lastly, of direct
introduction of the disease in perverted intercourse (pederasty, coitus
heterotopicus).Ulcer of the intestine is occasionally, though comparatively very
rarely, observed also as the result of pressure from within or without.Such an ulcer is properly considered of traumatic or mechanical origin,
as it is induced as the direct effect of mechanical irritation or
arrest of blood-supply.Thus, dense masses of inspissated feces,
foreign bodies, indigestible residue of food, may fret the mucous
surface into a condition of hyperaemia, and, later, absolute
ulceration.Undue retention, as behind a cicatricial contraction, or an
occlusion from whatever cause at places where the intestinal tube
normally offers resistance (at the ileo-caecal valve, sigmoid flexure,
etc.), may lead to ulceration in the same way.Schonlein has called
attention to the paralytic condition of the intestinal muscularis in
age as a predisposing cause of mechanical intestinal ulcer; and Virchow
has noticed the same condition among the insane, whose intense
preoccupation leads to neglect of evacuation of the bowels.Certain
intestinal parasites, more especially ascarides, are admitted as
occasional causes of ulceration, and more superficial solutions of
continuity in the rectum have been noticed as the result of too
frequent or too careless use of enemata.{824} Curling was the first to call attention to the fact that
extensive burns of the skin are sometimes followed by ulceration of the
intestines.The ulcerative process is almost exclusively confined to
the duodenum.Various attempts have been made to explain the intestinal
ulcer consequent upon burning of the skin, but a satisfactory
explanation is lacking as yet.Leube suggests an inhibition in the
force of the circulation by reason of accumulation of waste products in
the blood, while Billroth believes the ulcer to be the result of an
embolic process.Whatever the cause, the frequency of its occurrence
makes it more than a mere coincidence.According to Meyer, it is
observed most frequently in women, and shows its first symptoms in
seven to fourteen days after the initial burn.Aside from toxic and traumatic causes, ulcer of the intestine occurs as
the result of dysentery, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis--diseases
mentioned in the order of frequency in the production of intestinal
ulcer.The ulcers of dysentery in the large intestine, and of typhoid
fever in the small intestine, assume such prominence in these
affections--having even been erroneously considered at one time as the
cause of these maladies--that their study belongs to the history of
these diseases.The ulcer of tuberculosis is rather an accident in the
course of this affection, and is now recognized as the occasional
result of direct infection by the ingestion of tuberculous flesh, or,
far more frequently, of the deglutition of tuberculous sputum.As a
rule, the tuberculous ulcer shows itself late in the course of
pulmonary phthisis, and is the cause of the obstinate and colliquative
diarrhoea which speedily exhausts the patient.Yet cases are
occasionally met in which numerous or extensive ulcers occur in the
intestinal canal early in the history of phthisis, before any serious
damage has been inflicted upon the lungs.The tuberculous ulcer
affects, and for the most part is confined to, the same structures
which form the seat of disease in typhoid fever--viz.the solitary and
agminated glands of the ileum.When the bacilli tuberculosis are
conveyed to the intestine by means of the lymph- and blood-supply
through the mesenteric vessels, the resulting ulcer takes the shape of
the vascular arrangement; that is, the long axis of the ulcer is at
right angles to the course of the tube.Thus, if sufficiently
extensive, the ulcer may be circular or form a girdle or ring entirely
around the tube.With the tubercular ulcer or ulcers are usually found
tubercular nodules or plaques in the serous coat, which are visible to
the naked eye as opacities or milky deposits beneath the peritoneal
coat.The glands of the mesentery may be at the same time so much
increased in size as to form visible or palpable tumors in the abdomen.The frequency with which tuberculosis affects the vermiform appendix
has already been noticed in detail in the etiology of perityphlitis.The ulcer of the intestine which is the result of a catarrhal process,
so called, belongs to the history of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery.The true intestinal ulcer, per se, which has its analogue in the
stomach as the gastric ulcer, ulcus rotundum, is due to the same cause
as in the stomach--viz.to arrest of circulation and erosion by the
gastric juice.It is a well-established fact in physiology that gastric
digestion is continued--is, indeed, mainly effected--in the small
intestine; hence it is not surprising to learn that an arrest of
circulation in the small intestine {825} is attended by the same
result.The fact that this so-called peptic ulcer is found almost
exclusively in the duodenum speaks most emphatically for this origin of
the disease.Arrest of the circulation in the intestinal wall may be
due to embolus, which, according to the observations of Nothnagel and
Parenski, is not infrequently found in the branches of the duodenal
artery; to infarction, the condition so commonly encountered in pyaemia
and septicaemia; or to thrombotic occlusion, as seen in amyloid
degeneration--a disease process which selects by preference the vessels
of the alimentary canal, along with those of the kidney and spleen.The duodenal resembles the gastric ulcer in form as well as origin.It
has the same appearance, in its recent stage at least, of having been
cut out with a punch, shows no inflammation, induration, or thickening
about its borders, and presents the same funnel-shape with terraced
walls, its apex below eccentrically situated, as a rule corresponding
to the situation of the artery.It is most frequently found in the
upper horizontal portion of the duodenum, but is occasionally, though
rarely, seen in the descending portion.In the further course of the
duodenum the gastric juice becomes gradually neutralized, so that
ulcers situated below the orifice of the gall-ducts are very great
exceptions.In Krauss' collection of 47 cases but 2 were found in the
lower sections of the duodenum.The intestinal like the gastric ulcer
is usually found single or alone, but occasionally two, three, or even
four ulcers are encountered.According to the tables of Morot, a single
ulcer is found in 81.8 per cent.of cases, two in 9.2 per cent., and
three and four in 4.5 per cent.Duodenal like gastric ulcers are attended with the liability to
hemorrhage and perforation in equal if not greater degree.There is
also the same tendency to implication of contiguous structures.Stich
records a case of perforation of the aorta; Eichenhorst mentions the
formation of abnormal communication with the gall-bladder; and
Frerichs, a thrombosis of the vena porta in consequence of duodenal
ulcer.Lastly, the process of cicatrization may be followed by the same
disasters as occur in pyloric ulcers in consequence of contraction and
constriction.Thus, the orifices of the pancreatic or choledochus ducts
may be narrowed or completely closed, or the whole lumen of the
duodenum obliterated, with consecutive dilatation of the stomach and
oesophagus, as in the case narrated by Biermer.A very nice question in
differential diagnosis as between pyloric carcinoma and pyloric or
duodenal ulcer is sometimes raised in this way.In the vast majority of
cases it is safe, even in the absence of a palpable tumor and without
regard to the age of the patient, to decide this question in favor of
carcinoma.Cases of complete occlusion constitute the rule in
carcinoma, and the very great exception in ulcer.It remains to be said that duodenal is much more rare than gastric
ulcer, in the ratio of 1 to 30, and that, unlike gastric ulcer, it
chiefly affects males.According to the statistics of Krauss, already
cited, the ratio of males to females is 9 to 1, and according to Trier
the ratio is 5 to 1.It occurs in greatest frequency between the ages
of thirty to forty, diminishing in frequency with advancing age.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Ulcer of the intestines announces itself by symptoms
which are, as a rule, much more vague and indefinite than the same
process in the stomach.In a certain percentage of cases the symptoms
{826} may be entirely latent, and the cause of a sudden death be
revealed only on the post-mortem table.In less severe cases the entire
symptomatology of intestinal ulcer is grouped under the term dyspepsia,
no characteristic phenomena being manifest throughout the course of the
disease.On the other hand, a very small ulcer may give rise to the most
dangerous symptoms--hemorrhage and perforative peritonitis, which may
be even fatal in the course of a few days or hours.Among the symptoms that appear with prominence in the course of the
disease is pain.Although cases are abundantly on record marked by the
entire absence of pain, and although pain is by no means so universally
present as in gastric ulcer, it occurs in the great majority of cases
of ulcer of the intestine.The pain of intestinal ulcer distinguishes
itself from gastric ulcer by being more independent of the character of
the food or the time of taking it.For the most part, it occurs in
attacks of colic, which are characterized at times by their extreme
severity, long duration, and obstinacy to every means of relief.These
attacks occur in paroxysms with complete or only incomplete remissions,
and are ascribed, as in gastric ulcer, to the erosive action of the
gastric juice upon exposed nerve-fibres, the intervals of relief
corresponding to the periods of exhaustion of the nerve-centres.At the
same time, in exceptional cases, a long-continued localized tenderness
to pressure may indicate the seat of the disease.Palpation may elicit, besides tenderness, points or regions of
induration or intumescence.Such a condition is more especially
encountered in cases of tuberculous disease, the so-called scrofula of
the intestine or the tabes mesenterica of childhood.More localized
enlargements are occasionally to be felt in the vicinity of the
duodenal or other intestinal ulcer in consequence of circumscribed
peritonitis, with its resultant agglutinations and adhesions.In this
connection caution must be exercised not to confound masses of impacted
feces with tumefactions.The history of constipation or the
administration of a light laxative will generally suffice to remove
this source of error.Anorexia is a symptom of intestinal ulcer as a rule.The loss of
appetite may amount to a complete aversion to all food or only to the
more fatty articles of diet.A curious exception to this rule is not
infrequently seen in the unappeasable hunger of children the victims of
tuberculous ulceration.The contrast offered in the extreme emaciation
of these patients has been made the subject of frequent comment.With this loss or perversion of appetite and defective digestion of the
food, the general condition soon begins to fail.Though cases are
occasionally met in which a bien-etre has been maintained for years, or
a condition of obesity has been retained, these cases form the
exception in the history of intestinal ulcer.More or less emaciation
gradually develops as a rule, and a reduction of the general strength
that is out of all proportion in its degree to the loss of flesh.At
the same time the mental condition of the patient suffers a degradation
to the level of the sufferer with chronic dyspepsia.The disturbances of digestion which occur in intestinal ulcer present
many varieties in degree and kind.Some patients show none or but few
of the signs, while others run the gamut, so to speak, in the
semeiology of dyspepsia.Heartburn, eructations, pyrosis, borborygmi,
flatulence, gastralgias, pseudo-anginas, nausea, and vomiting, the
familiar {827} phenomena of gastric or intestinal catarrh, attend at
some time or other in the course of the disease most of the cases of
intestinal ulcer.The condition of the discharges demands notice in detail, more
especially as abnormalities in the evacuations belong among the few of
the more constant symptoms of the disease.Diarrhoea is the rule in intestinal ulcer.The discharges consist at
first of the undigested food and the digestive juices, which have been
hurried along the alimentary canal and prematurely evacuated on account
of the increase of peristalsis caused by the irritation in the upper
part of its tract.The arrest of the digestive process leads to early
decomposition of the ingested matters, and thus imparts to the
discharges an exceedingly offensive odor.While, in exceptional cases,
constipation may be present, or even obstipation of the bowels, the
discharges are usually so abundant as to constitute a diarrhoea, which
in some cases is so frequent or profuse as to become colliquative and
speedily exhaust the strength of the patient.An ulceration situated in the colon or rectum would furnish the
discharges characteristic of dysentery, already described in detail,
while the same process in the ileum would show the evacuations
characteristic of typhoid fever or tuberculosis.The most characteristic ingredient of the true duodenal ulcer is blood.As stated in the article on HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS, ulcer of the
intestine constitutes the most frequent source of this accident, which
is sometimes so grave as to destroy life in the course of a few days or
hours.The blood from an intestinal ulcer may be evacuated both by the
mouth and the anus, or may be retained in the alimentary canal and not
appear at all.Such cases constitute the condition known and described
under the heading of occult or concealed hemorrhage, which is
recognized by the rapid general collapse of the patient.When the blood
issues from a duodenal ulcer, it is intimately commingled with the
contents of the alimentary canal.The discharges in such cases are
usually black, tarry, and more or less fluid; whereas blood from the
colon or rectum still preserves its fresh red color and is discharged
separate from the feces or simply coats its exterior.Occasionally
cases are met where the blood coagulates in the interior of the
intestinal canal, to form a cast of its lumen or to accumulate in great
mass in the sigmoid flexure or rectum.In one case in the experience of
the author such an accumulation was the cause of a very severe
tenesmus, which was only relieved by the digital evacuation of large
masses of inspissated, coagulated blood.The presence of pus would indicate lesion of the colon, as typically
shown in dysentery, as suppuration, at least with any visible products,
does not occur in ulcer of the duodenum.DURATION.--Ulcer of the intestine has no definite duration.As in the
case of its prototype, gastric ulcer, it may speedily be covered with
cicatricial tissue and never appear again in the course of a long life.But such a course is as unusual as in gastric ulcer.Frequent
recurrence constitutes the rule in intestinal ulcer, or a partial
recovery with frequent relapses, as in the course of ulcer of the
stomach.So ulcer of the intestine is not infrequently a lifetime
malady, with exacerbations and remissions dependent largely upon the
prudence or imprudence of the patient with regard to diet.It need
hardly be stated that ulcer of the intestine {828} may terminate
fatally even in the course of a few days from hemorrhage, circumscribed
and later diffuse peritonitis, or may drag out a slow length of years,
to finally destroy the patient with the general symptoms of inanition,
hydrops, and marasmus.DIAGNOSIS.--From what has been already stated, it is seen that ulcer of
the intestine is often entirely overlooked or may be readily confounded
with other maladies of the digestive tract.Cases of traumatic or toxic
origin are generally readily recognized by the history of the patient,
and tuberculosis reveals itself by the youth of the individual, the
existence of the disease elsewhere, the gradual emaciation, the
premature senescence--in short, the general signs of the phthisical
habitus, the meteorism, and perhaps the presence of nodular
enlargements of the mesenteric glands.The most characteristic symptom of the peptic ulcer is, as has been
stated, hemorrhage.But hemorrhage is present in only the minority of
cases, is, as a rule, occasional and transitory, and is at all times
difficult of differentiation as to its source.Blood from a gastric
ulcer may also be voided per rectum as well as per os, and the blood
from a duodenal ulcer after regurgitation may be wholly discharged by
vomiting.The absence of vomiting and the presence--more especially the
persistence--of tarry evacuations from the bowels would speak for ulcer
of the intestine.Dilatation of the duodenum, a condition of ectasia,
closure of the bile-duct with consecutive jaundice, or the presence of
fatty stools from occlusion of the pancreatic duct (a sign not now
regarded of the same value as in the days of Bright), would also
declare in favor of ulcer in the duodenum.As between intestinal ulcer and catarrh or intestinal ulcer and
carcinoma, precisely the same rules would hold as in the case of the
stomach.A simple enteralgia would be recognized by its more frequent
occurrence among females or individuals of neurotic temperament; by its
connection with faults of diet, malaria, or exposure to cold; by the
absence of hemorrhage, diarrhoea, or peritonitis.PROGNOSIS.--Too much caution cannot be exercised in the prognosis of
ulcer of the intestine; for even in the cases which run a perfectly
mild course the gravest, even fatal, accidents are liable to occur.The
danger of perforation in cases of typhoid fever from a single or from
one of the few ulcers that may be present imparts one of the chief
elements of gravity to this disease; and the same catastrophe may occur
at any time in dysentery or tuberculosis.The duodenal ulcer may
likewise have a sudden gravity imparted to a mild case by a copious
hemorrhage or a peritonitis, and, even though the patient escape all
possible complications, to recover with the surface of the ulcer healed
so that the loss of substance is filled in with firm cicatricial
tissue, the danger of contraction or stenosis still remains.The ulcers
of dysentery in the colon and of syphilis in the rectum are especially
liable to be followed by deformities of this kind, while the
tuberculous ulcer in the ileum not infrequently results in a more or
less complete stenosis.The ulcer of typhoid fever in its cicatrization
almost never reduces the size of the intestinal canal.TREATMENT.--The most valuable therapeutic means of relieving the pain
and obviating the dangers of ulcer of the intestine consist in the
{829} regulation of the diet.The food should be light, easily
digestible, and during the acute stage of the disease as nearly fluid
in its consistency as may be.Milk would be the staple article of diet
in all cases were it not for the fact that in some cases constipation
attends its too exclusive use.The various soups, without solids,
broths, preparations of starch (sago, arrowroot, tapioca, etc.), may
sufficiently nourish the patient until the healing process shall have
commenced.Raw beef, chopped up and made into an emulsion, is perhaps
the most nutritious and least injurious of any kind of food.Bread,
potatoes and other vegetables should be ruled out altogether, because
of their liability to produce masses of feces whose inspissation may do
mechanical damage to ulcers in process of cicatrization.Where there is failure in the general strength early resort should be
had to alcohol, which may be administered in the form of red wine (in
preference to white, because of the tannin it contains), wine-whey, or,
in more serious prostration, of sherry wine, milk punch, egg-nog made
with good whiskey or brandy.In the worst cases, where all food irritates, feeding by the mouth may
be abandoned altogether for a time, and the strength of the patient
sustained by nutritive enemata of beef or pancreatic emulsion.The diarrhoea should be controlled rather than entirely checked, for
fear of the greater evil of constipation.A little bismuth with
bicarbonate of sodium or oxide of zinc may suffice for the milder
cases, while in the more aggravated cases resort must be had sooner or
later to opium.Constipation is best relieved by careful injections of warm water or by
the administration of the lighter laxatives--mineral waters, Seidlitz
powders, citrate of magnesia, castor oil, etc.Vomiting is combated by ice, soda-water, champagne, cherry-laurel
water, and in graver cases morphia hypodermically.Pain may be relieved by applications of hot water, cataplasms,
injections of hot water, and, when necessary, by morphia with or
without belladonna.Hemorrhage is checked by ice internally and externally, turpentine,
ergot or preferably ergotin by hypodermic injection, and opium.Peritonitis, more especially perforative peritonitis, calls
imperatively for the liberal use of opium.Patients the victims of intestinal ulcer must maintain a guarded diet
for months, often for years, after all signs of the disease have
disappeared as the best prophylaxis against recurrence.Constant
vigilance is also required to avoid constipation, and the greatest
temperance exercised with regard to the use of alcohol.The author has
at the present time a patient under treatment who presents all the
symptoms of duodenal ulcer, including hemorrhage, with every indulgence
in strong drink, and in whom all symptoms disappear under entire
abstention.Sometimes a course of mineral waters, a sea-voyage, or
other change of life or scene constitutes the best means of avoiding
frequent relapse.It need hardly be said that an ulcer in the rectum, which is readily
recognized by its attending tenesmus, calls for local treatment; and it
is equally plain that tuberculosis or syphilis requires appropriate
internal means of relief.{830}

HEMORRHAGE OF THE BOWELS.BY JAMES T. WHITTAKER, M.D.GENERAL REMARKS.--Hemorrhage of the bowels occurs in both sexes, though
more frequently in the male, and at all ages, though more frequently at
the middle period of life.In the infant a form of it is sometimes
considered as a distinct affection under the head of melaena
neonatorum, and in age it sometimes shows itself as a distinct sign of
a disease characteristic of age--namely, cancer.According to the
tables of Bamberger, it is caused in the order of frequency by
dysentery, typhus fever, cancer (of the colon), mechanical injury,
poisons and foreign bodies, ulceration (tubercular, follicular), the
round ulcer of the duodenum, and aneurism; last and least frequent is
the so-called vicarious hemorrhage.ETIOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the intestinal canal arises from (1)
anomalies in the contents of the bowel; (2) disease of the wall of the
bowel; and (3) from general diseases.(1) The inspissation of the natural contents of the bowel during
long-standing or habitual constipation may convert the feces into dense
masses which irritate and scratch the mucous membrane, and thus induce
hemorrhage directly by simple solution of continuity, or indirectly as
the result of extreme hyperaemia.Such hemorrhage is nearly always
slight, streaking or coating the surface of the scybalous mass or being
extruded from the anus as a small deposit of blood during the last act
of defecation; in which latter case it is found mostly associated with
hemorrhoids or fissure of the anus--conditions which require separate
description.Independent of these conditions, the hemorrhage nearly
always has its origin in the lowest regions of the large intestine,
where condensation of the feces is naturally greatest.Foreign bodies in the intestinal canal descended from the stomach may
also be the cause of hemorrhage in the same way.Thus, stones of
fruits, bones of fish, fragments of oyster-shell, or other substances
in no way connected with aliments (false teeth, buttons, pins and
needles, etc.), may be swallowed accidentally or purposely (as by
children or the insane) to produce intestinal hemorrhage.Drastic
cathartics (podophyllin, gamboge, etc.)and poisons (arsenic, mineral
acids) occasionally act in the same way.Thus, Tardieu reports[1] the
case of a servant to whom was administered by a homoeopath veratrin
with coffee, with fatal effect in six days.At the autopsy, made by
Amussat and Reymond, the stomach and small {831} intestine were found
filled with a dark-brown or black bloody fluid, but there was no trace
of perforation, ulceration, or organic disease.[Footnote 1: _Annales d'Hygiene_, July, 1854.]Under this head mention should be made also of certain parasites whose
habitat is the intestinal canal, the walls of which they perforate.Two
varieties, the Anchylostoma duodenale and the Distoma hepaticum, are
frequent causes of hemorrhage, the former from the duodenum and
jejunum, the latter from the rectum, in hot climates, more especially
in India and Egypt.(2) Anomalies in the intestinal walls produce hemorrhage as the result
of intense hyperaemia (per diapedesin) or of actual loss of substance
(per rhexin).Copious, even fatal, hemorrhage has thus ensued from
dysenteric and typhoid processes (and even without discoverable cause)
where no ulceration or loss of substance could be discovered on
autopsy; and this accident is so frequent as the result of ulceration
in the diseases mentioned as to constitute a characteristic sign or
complication.It must be said, however, that cases of alarming or fatal
hemorrhage without apparent cause during life or lesion after death
were more frequently reported in the literature of the times preceding
our more accurate knowledge of pathology and pathogeny.Few clinicians
or pathologists would now be content with reports made without full
knowledge of the history of the case or microscopic examination of the
intestinal walls.Thus, the report to the Societe Medicale d'Emulation,
April 2, 1834, by Dubois of a young man who quickly died of intestinal
hemorrhage five days after a severe headache, and on the same occasion
by Guillemot of several similar cases, would awaken the suspicion of
masked typhoid fever; and the case of an old man aged seventy-four who
died of intestinal hemorrhage after four days' diarrhoea, reported by
Husson,[2] would call for a close examination of the vessels in the
intestinal walls.In fact, Bricheteau, who reported a case from the
Hopital Neckar, was able on autopsy to discover a rupture in a small
artery of the intestines.[Footnote 2: _Proceedings of the Anatomical Society at Paris_, 1835.]Embolic processes leading to the formation of ulceration (by
predilection in the duodenum) are often attended with intestinal
hemorrhage, which would be more constantly present were it not for the
fact that, as in the stomach, the speedy establishment of collateral
circulation prevents the consequences of complete infarction.Besides dysentery and typhoid fever, tuberculosis and syphilis are
occasional causes of ulceration and necrosis of the intestinal walls
which may be attended with hemorrhage.Cancer of the intestine most
frequently affects the rectum, but wherever situated may show
hemorrhage as one of its signs.The local hyperplasia of the mucous tissue which constitutes a
polypus--and which in children, in whom it most frequently occurs, is
mostly situated in the rectum--is suspected to exist or is recognized
by the frequent discharge of blood from the bowels.A far more grave
affection of the intestinal walls, likewise most frequent in childhood,
is the peculiar dislocation known as intussusception or invagination.This condition is so commonly attended with distressing evacuations of
blood and mucus as to simulate dysentery.The strangulation of the
intussuscepted mesentery with its vessels easily accounts for the
hemorrhage in such cases.A more extensive compression is exercised at times by tumors in the
{832} abdominal cavity, as by pregnancy, ovarian growths, etc.,
occlusions in the course of the portal system (cirrhosis hepatis),
interference with the general circulation, as in diseases of the heart
or lungs, with intestinal hemorrhage as a consequence.Diseases of the blood-vessels themselves, as amyloid degeneration,
aneurism, should not be omitted from the list of factors possibly
productive of this result.(3) The general diseases attended with hemorrhage from the bowel are
characterized for the most part by more or less general disintegration
or dissolution of the blood, with the manifestation of hemorrhage in
various parts of the body--kidneys, uterus, subcutaneous tissue, etc.;
the enterorrhagia being an accidental localization, so to speak, of the
effusion.The most prolific causes of this disorganization are the
micro-organisms which "touch the life of the blood corruptibly;" and
hence the various acute infectious diseases may show in the severer
forms hemorrhage from the bowels.Under this head may be ranged
variola, which boasts even of a hemorrhagic form; typhus, yellow, and
malarial fevers; the forms of nephritis marked by uraemia, cholera,
icterus gravis, erysipelas, etc.Disintegration of the blood or partial
dissolution of its corpuscular elements occurs also in those obscure
affections which constitute the group, or are included in the
description, of the hemorrhagic diatheses, as haemophilia, leuchaemia,
pernicious anaemia, scurvy; of any of which enterorrhagia may be a
distinct or dangerous sign.Melaena neonatorum is the distinct name given to a hemorrhage from the
bowels which occurs a few hours or days after birth, and which is often
so profuse as to cause death at once or in a short time.In most cases
no anatomical lesions can be discovered after death, save an intense
hyperaemia of the intestinal mucosa, so that the etiology of this
affection is involved in obscurity.The various causes assigned in its
production--ulceration of the stomach or duodenum (Bohn), embolism
(Landau), fatty degeneration (Steiner), premature ligature of the
umbilical cord (Kiwisch)--answer only for individual cases.Betz
reported a case in a family subject to haemophilia, and Trousseau once
saw twins thus affected; but that heredity cannot account for all cases
is shown by the fact that it occurs mostly in healthy children from
healthy parentage.Klebs is inclined to attribute the affection to the
action of micro-organisms, introduced perhaps as the result of
puerperal infection, but this cause can be assumed in only a small
minority of cases; at least, but a small percentage of cases coincide
with puerperal disease on the part of the mother.Eichhorst states that Hecker
observed it but once in 500 births, and Gemich but once in 1000 births.According to Rilliet, the hemorrhage is oftener (8/14) intestinal,
rarer (4/14) gastric, and rarest (2/14) both.It is almost always
abundant and quickly repeated, the blood being mostly pure, in clots or
masses and fluid, though it is sometimes commingled with meconium.It
usually ceases within twenty-four hours, though it may continue for
three, five, or more days.Of 23 cases reported by this author, 12
recovered and 11 died.MORBID ANATOMY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels, being only a symptom of
very many different conditions, is marked by lesions characteristic of
the condition in an individual case.These lesions are more
appropriately described in connection with the various diseases.Not
{833} infrequently in these cases the intestine is distinguished by the
absence of any lesion at all; but, from whatever cause, hemorrhage from
the bowels, like hemorrhage from any other source, shows a more or less
profound anaemia of all the internal organs, and in more chronic and
protracted cases leads to fatty degeneration, more especially of the
heart.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Hemorrhage from the bowels is usually readily
recognized by the discharge of blood, either pure or mixed with the
natural contents of the alimentary canal.The actual seat of the
hemorrhage may, however, only rarely be recognized by the rectal
speculum.The colicky pains, borborygmi, or sensations of fluids in the
abdomen which are occasionally experienced may not be relied upon in
fixing the seat of the effusion.Should the hemorrhage occur in
quantity, or, more especially, should the seat of the effusion be low
in the intestinal canal, the blood which escapes is more or less pure.When the hemorrhage is higher, or when the stay of the blood in the
bowel is longer, it becomes more or less incorporated with the contents
of the bowels or altered by the intestinal juices to present a
discharge of mushy or semi-fluid consistence, of dark-brown or black
color.So-called tarry stools are thus largely composed of blood.But serious, even fatal, hemorrhage sometimes occurs without the escape
of any blood at all.Such are the so-called cases of concealed, occult,
or internal hemorrhage, in which the nature of the malady is only
suspected or recognized by the general symptoms attending the profuse
loss of blood.Should the hemorrhage be gradual, anaemia slowly
supervenes, with hydraemia and subcutaneous dropsy.Traube reports a
fatal case of oedema of the glottis from such a cause.Sudden
hemorrhage announces itself by pallor and prostration, dyspnoea,
vertigo, and syncope.Amaurosis, tinnitus aurium, formication, emesis,
and, if the disease be high up in the intestinal canal, haematemesis,
are the common attendants of serious hemorrhage.In the worst cases of
sudden effusion the patient may present the appearance of complete
collapse, and the intestinal canal be found on autopsy distended with
blood throughout a great part of its course, while no blood whatever
has escaped from the rectum.In such cases, or with more gradual loss
of blood, the patient experiences a sense of increasing weakness, the
skin becomes cold and bedewed with a clammy sweat, the pulse grows
feebler, the temperature falls, and death from exhaustion more or less
speedily ensues.DIAGNOSIS.--The presence of blood in any quantity in the stools is
readily recognized by its coarser characteristics.Ridiculous errors
have been made by mistaking the coloration produced by bismuth, iron,
logwood, etc.administered internally, or by coloring matters
introduced into the discharges for purposes of deception.The
microscope, Zeichmann's test for blood-crystals, and in extremely
doubtful or medico-legal cases the spectroscope, furnish easy means of
detecting blood in whatever quantity or character.It is the cause and seat, rather than the existence, of the hemorrhage
that mostly cause embarrassment in differential diagnosis.Hemorrhage
from the lungs, nose, or stomach is usually readily excluded by the
absence of any evidence of disease of these organs, and the presence of
the other symptoms of any general disease attended with enterorrhagia
makes a diagnosis in most cases easy enough.Alterations in the
contents of the {834} bowel, the presence of foreign bodies, are
recognized by the history of the case and by careful local examination,
while a diagnosis of anomalies in the walls of the bowel is usually
reached by exclusion.In no doubtful case should local inspection or
digital examination of the anus and rectum be omitted.TREATMENT.--As in all cases of hemorrhage, the first requisite is
absolute rest.The patient should be at once put to bed and kept
perfectly quiet.Many a case of hemorrhage in typhoid fever is produced
by arising from bed to go to stool.The bed-pan is an absolute
necessity in the management of a case of typhoid fever after the second
week of the disease.Rest is the chief agent in prophylaxis as well as
therapy.The most effective styptic in enterorrhagia is cold.An ice-bladder
should be laid upon or suspended immediately above the abdomen during
the whole duration of the flow.The injection of ice-water into the
bowel should be practised only in cases where the hemorrhage is
believed to come from the colon.Otherwise, the peristalsis it awakens
may only aggravate the danger.Should rest and cold fail to quickly
check the hemorrhage, resort should be had at once to ergot.This
remedy, in the form of ergotin, is most effective when introduced
beneath the skin.In cases of less imminent danger the practitioner may
be content to give the remedy by the mouth.Small doses of the simple or camphorated tincture of opium frequently
repeated speedily arrest contractions of the bowel, and at the same
time feed the brain in threatening syncope.The astringents
proper--tannic acid or its preparations, acetate of lead, alum, the
perchloride of iron--are seldom necessary or advisable, but may be
called for in obstinate or protracted cases.To turpentine has been ascribed, from time immemorial, specific virtues
in relief of hemorrhage of the bowels, and its administration is still
a routine system with many older practitioners.It is most effective in
large doses--one drachm, with milk or in emulsion, every hour or two
until the hemorrhage ceases.In relief of collapse, alcohol, ether, and musk are imperatively
indicated, with the external application of heat; and in the treatment
of the anaemia and hydraemia the preparations of iron, including,
later, the mineral waters which contain it.In the worst cases of
sudden alarming hemorrhage the physician should not fail to practise
the transfusion of blood or solutions of salt or soda.Milk is the best food and drink during the attack, and after it for
some days or weeks.Chopped or scraped raw beef may substitute it
later, while all farinaceous foods are to be strictly avoided for some
time.{835}

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION.BY HUNTER MCGUIRE, M.D.When a mechanical impediment to the passage of the contents of the
bowel along the intestinal canal exists, the condition is known as
intestinal obstruction.The causes of this occurrence are numerous, the
symptoms urgent, the diagnosis difficult, the treatment uncertain, and
the termination, unless relieved by nature or art, speedily fatal.There is no class of cases to which the practitioner is called more
important, or which demands on his part greater skill and judgment.It is customary to divide the causes of obstruction of the bowels into
two great classes--acute and chronic.In acute cases the attack is sudden, the symptoms violent, and, unless
the cause is speedily removed, life ends in a few hours or at most in a
few days.In chronic cases the causes act comparatively more slowly,
the symptoms are chronic and less urgent, and danger of death less
imminent.In this class the cause is not uncommonly spontaneously
relieved, and the individual restored to perfect health without the aid
of medicine or the surgeon's art.This result may happen in apparently
the most desperate cases.This classification of acute and chronic obstruction is necessary for a
proper clinical study of the subject, but it should be remembered that
in practice there will be found some cases which partake of many of the
symptoms of both acute and chronic obstruction, making it difficult to
determine to which division the cases properly belong.It will also be
seen that some, at first, well-marked acute cases subside and become
chronic in character, and that (old) chronic cases of obstruction
sometimes suddenly change their nature and become acute.Again, some of
the causes mentioned as giving rise to acute obstruction of the bowel
in rare instances produce symptoms of chronic obstruction, and some of
the causes referred to as giving rise to symptoms of chronic
obstruction in rare instances provoke signs of acute obstruction.As a rule, the following list embraces
conditions which produce symptoms of acute obstruction:

1.Impaction of foreign bodies, gall-stones, enteroliths, etc.Twisting of the bowel--volvulus.Internal strangulation by loops, bands, false membranes,
diverticula, mesenteric pouches, slipping of a portion of bowel into
natural or unnatural openings, diaphragmatic hernia, etc.As a rule, the following causes produce symptoms of chronic intestinal
obstruction:

1.Stricture of the bowel, sometimes cancerous.Contraction of the bowel from inflammatory changes, often
tuberculous.A consideration of external hernia is, of course, not included in this
paper, but the possibility of the symptoms of intestinal obstruction
being due to this cause should never be overlooked.Congenital Strictures and Malformations.Cases of congenital strictures and malformations are confined almost
wholly to the rectum and anus, and come more properly under the
province of the surgeon.Some of the cases, however, belong to the
physician, the obstruction being so slight as not to require surgical
assistance.With all of them, however, the physician should be
familiar, that he may be able to distinguish between congenital
malformation giving rise to immediate obstruction and other forms of
intestinal occlusion.He should know, too, when to seek the aid of the
surgeon.For these reasons, as well as to make the history of the
causes of intestinal obstruction as complete as possible, it has been
thought proper to include in the list congenital occlusion and
malformation of the intestine.They will be treated, however, in the
briefest possible way, and the reader is referred to works on surgery
for a more detailed account of the pathology, symptoms, and treatment.When congenital occlusion of the colon occurs, it is almost invariably
found in the sigmoid flexure, and is due, as most congenital atresia of
the intestine, to foetal peritonitis.Congenital occlusion may be found
in any portion of the small bowel, but a frequent site is the lower
part of the ileum and the ileo-caecal opening.The following case[1]
gives an example of a form of stricture of the duodenum in infants,
with the symptoms and pathological changes.The septum is supposed to
be an unnaturally developed valve, or two valvulae conniventes united:
"A child when born presented no unusual symptoms for the first
twenty-four hours.Vomiting then came on, and continued with short
intermissions until death, which took place some thirty-eight hours
after birth.The only
disease found was stricture of the duodenum close to the entrance of
the gall-duct, so that a probe passed down the latter entered the
duodenum immediately below the constriction.There was nothing to
indicate in what manner the constriction had occurred.On the gastric
side of the latter the duodenum was immensely distended--so much so
that at first sight it appeared like the pyloric end of the stomach
itself, and only by a more careful examination was the distinction
between the stomach and intestine detected by a ridge running around
their place of junction."Pollock in Holmes's _System of Surgery_,
from _Pathological Transactions_, vol.{837} Cases like this, a number of which are on record, are instructive
and of pathological interest; when, however, congenital occlusion
exists in the small intestines, no treatment can be suggested.If the
sigmoid flexure is the part involved and diagnosis can be made, opening
the intestine in the right groin and establishing an artificial anus
should be attempted.In the development of the foetus the anal part of the bowel, beginning
below, develops upward, and the intestinal portion, commencing above,
grows downward; both portions, advancing, finally unite, making one
continuous tube.When, however, there is some interruption in the
foetal development of the intestine, and the two portions of bowel fail
to unite, we have malformation of the rectum and anus and intestinal
obstruction; or the two portions of bowel may have been united and
continuity of the intestinal track established, and subsequent
intra-uterine inflammation may obliterate the canal.Under these
circumstances a ligamentous cord represents the original tube.The cord
descends from the cul-de-sac in which the upper part of the bowel ends
to the skin about the anus, or is lost in the tissues about the neck of
the bladder.In congenital malformations the following conditions may
be found: 1st.The anal orifice may be so minute as not to allow the
feces to escape; or the aperture may be occluded by a membrane, through
which the meconium may be seen; or the anus may be entirely absent.The rectum may be occluded by a membranous septum, the presence of
which is not suspected until symptoms of intestinal obstruction arise,
and then it is discovered by introducing the finger or a probe; or the
rectum may be entirely absent, the colon terminating in the iliac fossa
in a dilated pouch, or ending at the top of the sacrum or stopping at
any point between this and the normal anus, the place being determined
by the period of arrest of foetal development; or, the anus being
absent, the rectum may open into the vagina, bladder, urethra, and
other places.Intestinal obstruction may arise from the introduction, accidental or
otherwise, of foreign bodies into the stomach and bowels.Coins,
marbles, bullets, fruit-seeds, etc.are often swallowed by children,
sometimes intentionally, and if the object is round and small it rarely
gives rise to any serious trouble.The foreign body, however, if small,
may drop into the appendix vermiformis or some other diverticulum and
end in serious mischief, or if the individual has stricture of the
bowel the foreign body may be arrested by it.Foreign bodies which are pointed or irregular in shape, swallowed by
accident or design, may give rise to dangerous and fatal symptoms, but
not unfrequently they escape per vias naturales.Thus, pins, needles,
pieces of bone, artificial plate and teeth, small pen-knives, and other
pointed or irregular-shaped bodies, have passed in this way.Sharp-pointed bodies, as needles, sometimes make their way through the
walls of the stomach and present themselves at other and more distant
parts of the body.I have removed a needle from the calf of the leg
which {838} the patient had a month before accidentally swallowed.Jugglers accidentally, in practising their calling, and insane people,
not unfrequently intentionally, introduce into the stomach all sorts of
foreign bodies, such as buckles, forks, spoons, knives, pieces of wood,
iron, bone, etc.Gross[2] records the case of a juggler who let a bar
of lead ten inches long and weighing a pound slip into his stomach.Bell of Iowa removed it by gastrotomy, and the man recovered.Agnew[3]
reports a post-mortem of an insane woman in whose intestinal canal he
found three spools of cotton, two roller bandages, a number of skeins
of thread, and a pair of suspenders.[Footnote 2: _System of Surgery_, by S. D. Gross, 6th ed., vol.[Footnote 3: _Agnew's Surgery_, vol.The morbid appetite of some people, particularly girls and pregnant
women, sometimes induces them to swallow powdered chalk, magnesia, and
other substances, and when this practice is continued for a long time
the insoluble powder is deposited in the bowel and forms hard masses
which more or less completely obstruct the intestines.Stony concretions or enteroliths are found generally in the caecum or
in the sacculi of the colon, very rarely in the small intestines.They
are round or oval, and when two or more are found together they have
facets.They consist usually of carbonate of lime or magnesia or
sesquioxide of iron.Other concretions are sometimes seen composed of
starch or the felted husks of oats, called oat-stones (avenoliths),
found particularly among the poorer classes of people in Scotland.Other vegetable remains of husks, fibres, etc.Young and middle-aged people more frequently suffer with these
concretions than the old.Foreign bodies made up by the gradual
accumulation of hair, string, and other substances are not unfrequently
found in the stomach and intestines.The mass produced in this way is
often very large.Sometimes the foreign body is arrested in the
oesophagus.In a post-mortem reported to the writer by Fairfax a large
copper coin, accidentally swallowed a few days before, was found lodged
in the gullet.Ulceration followed, a neighboring artery was opened,
and the patient died from hemorrhage.Impaction of the bowel by gall-stones escaping from the gall-bladder
into the bowel is by no means an unfrequent cause of fatal obstruction.Small gall-stones, after giving rise to intense pain and often grave
symptoms during their passage through the bile-ducts, may escape into
the duodenum and be discharged through the rectum, as any other small
foreign body.If, however, there is constriction or stricture of the
bowel at any point, the small gall-stone may lodge there, and if other
stones follow and lodge, the collection may soon be great enough to
produce obstruction.A very large single stone or a number of stones
forming a coherent mass may collect in the gall-bladder, slowly distend
the dilatable biliary passages, and escape into the bowel; or--and this
is more common--an opening made by ulceration between the distended
gall-bladder and the duodenum allows the concretion to escape into the
small intestine.These stones or aggregation of stones are sometimes
three, four, or five inches in circumference and from one to four
inches long.They occur, as a rule, in people over fifty years of age,
and more commonly in women.Brinton, in his excellent book on
_Intestinal Obstruction_, makes the average age in these cases
fifty-three and a half {839} years, and from the statistics he has
gathered it will be seen that their occurrence is four times as often
in females as in males.In 41 cases collected by Leichtenstern, 32 were
women and 9 men.The site of the impaction is always in the small
intestines.In 32 cases observed by Leichtenstern, 17 were found in the
lower part of the ileum, 10 occupied the duodenum and jejunum, and 5
the middle part of the ileum.SYMPTOMS.--Foreign substances introduced into the stomach do not always
immediately give rise to serious symptoms.It is wonderful sometimes to
see how tolerant the stomach is of their presence.Many instances are
recorded of foreign bodies remaining in the stomach for months without
producing dangerous symptoms.The mass may be discharged by vomiting,
or it may escape through the pyloric opening into the intestine, and
ultimately be discharged through the rectum, or, lodging in the bowel,
give rise to symptoms of inflammation and obstruction.If, however, the
foreign mass remains in the stomach, and is not removed by the
surgeon's art or spontaneously discharged by ulceration, as in several
rare instances has been the case, it uniformly proves fatal.Before the foreign body is discharged by ulceration through the walls
of the abdomen, adhesive inflammation unites that portion of the
alimentary canal, gastric or intestinal, in which the mass is lodged
with some part of the abdominal wall.By this union the cavity of the
peritoneum is protected, just as we see the peritoneal sac protected by
an effusion of lymph in hepatic abscess opening into the small
intestine.If the adhesion between the canal and abdominal wall is
imperfect, or by an undue amount of inflammation is disunited, the
foreign body or inflammatory products which surround it may escape into
the peritoneal sac and produce fatal peritonitis.Instead of passing
through the abdominal wall, the foreign substance may escape into the
bladder or vagina, or from the small intestine into the colon or
rectum.Dangerous peritonitis may follow the simple presence of the
foreign body in the alimentary canal from the obstruction it produces
when no attempt at discharge by ulceration has been made.If the size
and shape of the body permit its passage into the small intestine, it
makes its way very slowly along this tube, giving rise to occasional
attacks of colicky pains and symptoms of partial impermeability of the
bowel.At any moment the foreign body may lodge, become impacted in the canal,
and all the grave symptoms of enteritis and general peritonitis present
themselves.Symptoms of inflammation may appear, and after a longer or
shorter time suddenly disappear, as if the foreign body had glided over
some point of obstruction and again begun its descent through the tube.Its course is always irregular, passing quite rapidly over a portion of
the intestine, then going more slowly, then lodging for a time at some
point where it is obstructed by a fold or the contents of the bowel or
by spasmodic contraction of the muscular coat of the intestines.As the
calibre of the small intestine gradually diminishes as it approaches
the caecum, the passage of the foreign body becomes more and more
difficult as it is propelled onward toward the ileo-caecal valve.After
a time it may reach the caecum, where, of all places, it is most apt to
lodge; but it may continue its course to the rectum, where it gives
rise to tenesmus and a constant desire to go to stool.Finally,
spontaneously or aided by the finger of the physician or some
instrument, it is {840} evacuated per anum.Not unfrequently, the
foreign body can be felt through the abdominal walls, and its course
traced day after day as it makes its way along the canal.It is a common practice with uninformed persons to give castor oil or
some purgative medicine when a pin, needle, coin, or other foreign
substance has accidentally passed from the mouth into the stomach.Experience has shown that the
larger and more solid the alvine discharges, the more likely the
foreign body is to escape by the natural outlet; and the physician
should order such a regimen and diet as will probably secure this
condition of the contents of the bowel.Long residence of a foreign mass at any point in the intestinal canal
is certain to produce some chronic enteritis and effusion of lymph and
subsequent stricture of the bowel, or the presence of the foreign body
may produce an ulcer; and when this is healed the resulting cicatrix
may end in serious obstruction from the natural tendency of the new
material to contract.Signs of constriction of the bowel may not be
noticed for some time after the escape of the foreign body.Obstruction from the presence of intestinal stones and concretions is
almost invariably preceded by impaired health, emaciation, or cachectic
appearance, signs of partial impermeability of the bowels, and repeated
attacks of inflammation, especially in the region of the caecum.It
terminates sometimes by the concretion becoming encysted, by its
spontaneous evacuation, or by ulceration and perforation, or sometimes
by complete occlusion of the bowel, and death.As occlusion of the bowel by the presence of gall-stones always occurs
in the small intestines, the symptoms are at once of the most urgent
and violent character.The signs are those of internal strangulation,
and the termination is often rapid in the extreme.Colicky, griping
pains are soon succeeded by violent agony; vomiting begins at once, and
is constant; at first bile is thrown up, and afterward feculent matter;
the pulse is small, wiry, and frequent; the belly is retracted; the
features are pinched, the extremities cold, and prostration soon comes
on, succeeded by collapse.Evidences of disorder of the liver, symptoms of inflammation of the
peritoneum in that region, or attacks of hepatic colic sometimes
precede obstruction of the bowel by gall-stones; unfortunately,
however, for the purposes of diagnosis, these premonitory symptoms are
not invariably present.Acute Internal Strangulation, Twisting, etc.When a portion of bowel within the abdomen is constricted, its
circulation interfered with, and the passage of the contents of the
bowel interrupted, it gives rise to acute internal strangulation.This
condition is very similar to that of external strangulated hernia.The
difference is, that one is inside and the other outside of the cavity
of the abdomen.Twisting of the gut upon its mesenteric axis, the passage of the bowel
through some natural or unnatural opening, the encircling of one
portion of bowel by another or by bands, false membranes, etc., may
cause {841} internal strangulation.It may happen at any age, and
involves generally the small intestine or the more movable parts of the
large bowel--viz.the sigmoid flexure and caecum.Twisting, or torsion, is not an unfrequent cause of intestinal
obstruction, and may involve almost any portion of the intestinal tube.Its most common site is the sigmoid flexure, and next in point of
frequency the caecum.It sometimes, but rarely, involves the small
intestines, and may occur as a simple twisting of one loop of
intestines upon another.First, the mesentery must be elongated.This change in the
mesenteric root may have been caused by the dragging of an old and
large hernia, or the mesentery may have been lengthened by relaxation
of the abdominal walls from childbearing or by the disappearance of
fat.However caused, before torsion of the gut takes place the
mesentery is elongated, so that the two ends are approximated and
something like a pedicle formed.Second, the portion of bowel attached
to the lengthened mesentery may become filled with an enormous quantity
of fecal matter and paralyzed by the great distension.In this paretic
condition it may be displaced by the living, moving parts around it,
and become bent and twisted, or the length of bowel belonging to the
elongated portion of the mesentery may be the seat of inflammation,
and, paralysis following, it becomes without resistance subject to the
pressure and movements of the active vital parts surrounding it.A
portion of bowel with its accumulated contents having a redundant
mesentery and paralyzed by enormous distension or by inflammation, or
by both, may readily be twisted more or less completely, and in some
cases several times upon itself.The weight of the bowel and its contents, along with the rapid
distension of the intestine above, fixes the gut in this state of
torsion and effectually prevents it from untwisting.A semi-rotation of
the paretic and distended bowel about the mesenteric axis is sufficient
to interfere with the supply and return of blood and provoke enteritis.Indeed, the rotation is rarely sufficiently great to produce complete
obstruction, and the symptoms are frequently rather those of
inflammation than of internal strangulation.For weeks before the final
attack the patient usually has symptoms of intestinal disorder, such as
flatulence, constipation, and spells of colic, due no doubt to the
changes provoked by the elongated mesentery and bent or curved
intestine.When torsion takes place the attack is sudden and the
symptoms violent and urgent.Vomiting, meteorism, insuperable
constipation, and frequently tenesmus, are soon followed by collapse
and speedy death.The patient may die in twenty-four hours; he rarely
lives beyond the fourth day.In some cases excessive tenesmus and
bloody stools are seen in the early stages of torsion of the bowel.The
condition may be mistaken for intussusception, but can usually be
distinguished by the premonitory symptoms of twisting and by the more
rapid course, the sudden meteorism, and quick collapse of the latter.Still another way by which displacement of intestine may occasion
obstruction to the passage of its contents is when a portion of the
intestine has a long and narrow mesentery, and around this mesentery,
which is like a pedicle, another portion of the bowel is thrown,
encircling and compressing it.The accompanying figure, taken from
_Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, gives a good idea of this condition (Fig.It represents a {842} loop of the small intestine placed around
the mesenteric pedicle of the sigmoid flexure.Leichtenstern calls this
"intertwining or knotting of two intestinal loops."Anterior view of the strangulated intestine and
stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]Posterior view of the strangulated intestine
and stricture._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal extremity.]In consequence of inflammation of the peritoneum and effusion of lymph,
peritoneal surfaces are joined together, and before the lymph is fully
organized these surfaces are separated by the constant movements of the
organs and the change in the relationship of the parts, and strings and
bands of various shapes and sizes are formed in which a portion of the
intestine may become entangled and constricted.Sometimes the bowel
accidentally becomes engaged in a loop or noose of false membrane, or
becomes bound down under a band of fibrin; or, the peritoneal surfaces
of some of the organs having been joined together or to the wall of the
abdomen or pelvis, a loop of bowel may escape into a slit or opening
and become incarcerated; or a fold of bowel may fall into a fissure in
the omentum or mesentery or broad ligament of the uterus or suspensory
ligament of the liver, and become constricted; or the appendix
vermiformis may be twisted around the intestine in such a way as to
cause ligation of the tube, or, by becoming attached to some
neighboring part, it may form a loop through which the intestine may
pass and become obstructed.In the same way the bowel may be
constricted by a diverticulum.Bands entangling the bowel and causing strangulation may be
attached to the fimbriated process of the Fallopian tube or the ovary
or uterus.Indeed, it is impossible to describe in a limited space the
almost infinite ways in which these bands and strings may engage and
incarcerate the intestinal tube (Figs.{843} [Illustration: FIG.An appearance of the natural relations of
the diverticulum to the intestine._a_, gastric extremity; _b_, rectal
extremity.]Internal strangulated hernia may result from the bowel falling into a
pouch of the peritoneum and becoming ligated by the orifice of the
pouch, or passing into the foramen of Winslow, of which there are three
cases of strangulation recorded; or a retro-peritoneal hernia may be
formed; or, more common still, a hernia of the intestine through the
diaphragm.In diaphragmatic hernia an opening is more frequently found in the
posterior part of this muscle.Two hundred and fifty-two cases of this
form of internal hernia have been collected by Leichtenstern, in which
the diagnosis was made in only five cases.He found the oesophageal
opening, a spot just behind the sternum, and a gap between the lumbar
and costal parts of the muscle, the weakest points in the diaphragm.Diaphragmatic and other forms of internal hernia may exist and not
produce symptoms of strangulation either at the time of formation or
subsequently, just as we so commonly see in cases of external hernia.When the bowel is constricted, however, and its circulation interfered
with, symptoms of internal strangulation come on, and are exactly like
the symptoms of external strangulated hernia.The attack is sudden, the
symptoms acute and urgent, and the course and termination very rapid.Unless the constriction is relieved death may take place in twenty-four
hours; life is rarely protracted beyond three or four days.The patient has first eructations, soon succeeded by nausea and
vomiting.The matter vomited consists of the contents of the stomach,
then of gastric fluid, bile, and the contents of the intestines.When
the last is ejected the vomiting is called fecal or stercoraceous.The
patient complains of a sense of constriction about the abdomen, griping
pains about the umbilicus, flatulence, tenesmus, and insuperable
constipation.One or two free stools from the large intestine below the
site of strangulation may be passed, but this should not deceive the
practitioner.As a rule, peritonitis soon follows strangulation.The
belly becomes tympanitic and tender, the pulse small and wiry, and the
face anxious.When gangrene supervenes the pain subsides, the pulse
becomes weak and intermittent, the surface cold and clammy, and the
patient soon dies in a state of collapse.Slight delirium may precede
death, or the mind remain unimpaired to the end.Very often, when
gangrene sets in and pain disappears, the patient has a grateful sense
of relief and is hopeful of recovery.{844} Intussusception, Invagination.One of the most frequent and important causes of intestinal obstruction
is intussusception or invagination of the bowel; by which term is meant
the protrusion or slipping of one portion of bowel into a portion
immediately adjoining.This condition is sometimes found after death in persons old or young,
but particularly the latter, in whom during life there were no symptoms
of intestinal obstruction or intestinal trouble of any kind.The
displaced intestine in these subjects is easily reduced, is unattended
by any signs of inflammation, and is evidently the result of spasmodic
contraction of the transverse muscular fibres of the bowel at one part,
with distension and relaxation at another part, by which, just before
death, one piece of the bowel is pushed into an adjacent piece.Not
unfrequently two or more invaginations are seen in the same subject.Flint[4] counted as many as fifteen in a child who died of typhoid
fever.This invagination of the death-struggle almost invariably
involves the small intestine, and may be the protrusion of a piece of
the bowel above into a piece immediately below, or the reverse, a
portion of bowel below being pushed into a portion above.It has been
suggested that this slight and temporary intussusception may occur
during life and give rise to temporary symptoms of intestinal
obstruction, which disappear when reduction of the displacement
spontaneously takes place.[Footnote 4: _Practice of Medicine_.]It will be seen by the diagrams that three successive portions of
intestine enter into the formation of an intussusception--an entering,
returning, and receiving portion.Two mucous surfaces and two serous
surfaces are thus brought into apposition.The mesentery attached to
the included lengths of bowel--viz.the entering and returning
lengths--is necessarily pulled down with the bowel in its descent, and
is also embraced by the receiving portion of the intestinal tube.The
traction excited by this portion of mesentery, thus wedged in between
the middle and inner layers of the bowel, materially alters what would
otherwise be the relationship of the parts.26 shows simple
invagination of the ileum like the finger of a glove, in consequence of
the traction exerted.The entering or invaginated portion does not
always lie in the axis of the enveloping tube, but is more or less
curved, until very often its lower orifice is in contact with the wall
of the outer layer.The concavity of this curve looks {845} toward the
mesenteric edge of the invaginated portion of bowel, and the convexity
toward the opposite side of the receiving portion.The convex side of
the middle cylinder is often thrown into transverse folds or
convolutions.Intussusception, which gives rise to symptoms
characteristic of intestinal obstruction during life, is invariably
from above downward.It is doubtful whether there is on record a single
well-authenticated case of inflammatory invagination where the lower
segment of bowel protruded into the upper.Reference to the diagrams will show that the lumen of the bowel is
diminished, and that more or less intestinal obstruction must follow
invagination.This obstruction is increased by the inflammation which
necessarily follows this condition.The large and numerous
blood-vessels of that portion of the mesentery involved in the
invagination are compressed and stretched; arterial supply, and
especially venous return, are interfered with; congestion quickly
follows, with copious inflammatory exudation; the layers of intestine
become swollen, and blood, sometimes in abundance, is poured out from
the mucous membrane.Peritonitis, limited sometimes to the invaginated
part, more often spreading to the peritoneum covering neighboring
structures, soon begins, and the contiguous serous surfaces are
agglutinated and the intussusception rendered irreducible.Lymph and
other inflammatory products are poured out freely; the coats of the
intestine become distended and thicker, and the inner and middle layers
of the invagination are separated by the deposit; the invaginated part
becomes more and more curved toward the mesenteric border of the outer
layer; and occlusion of the bowel, begun by the invagination, is made
more or less complete by the changes wrought by inflammation (Fig.That intestinal obstruction is not always complete in intussusception
is shown by the fact that fecal matter, often in considerable quantity,
is passed through the bent and narrowed tube, the intestine retaining,
at least for a time, its contractile power.The changes produced by
inflammation are chiefly seen in the inner and middle layers of
intestine, the receiving or outer layer of the invagination often
escaping any serious damage.These changes vary with the character and
duration of the inflammation.Sometimes they are limited to an
agglutination of the opposed serous membranes, an effusion of blood and
serum from the mucous surfaces, and an enormous distension and swelling
of all the invaginated parts; or the inflammation may end in
mortification of the middle or both the inner and middle cylinders, the
dead part coming away in shreds or in large fragments, or, if the
patient lives long enough, the entire invaginated tube being discharged
through the anus.If the inflammation involves the invaginated parts
unequally, strips and shreds of the bowel are detached by ulceration
and sloughing, and may escape in the discharge from the bowels in
pieces so small as to be unnoticed; but if the intussuscepted part dies
en masse, a circular line of demarcation is formed by ulceration, and
the dead segment is detached and drops into the cavity of the bowel
below, and escapes through the rectum.It is often so complete that the
inner and middle cylinders can be recognized, and the part of the
intestinal tube to which the expelled bowel belonged can be determined.In favorable cases the blood-vessels of the healthy bowel above and
below the dead segment pour out a circular mass of coagulable lymph,
which, becoming organized, closes the breach and {846} completes the
intestinal tube.To accomplish this it is necessary that the ends of
the two portions of bowel should be accurately coaptated: if they are
not, some opening may be left through which the contents of the gut may
escape into the peritoneal cavity, producing fatal peritonitis; or the
new formation may be imperfectly organized, and burst during some
peristaltic movement of the bowel or from the pressure of gas
accumulating in the gut; or the supply of lymph may be so redundant as
to obstruct the calibre of the bowel, or end in cicatricial
contraction, stricture, and obstruction.Aitken[5] records four
instances where the curved end of the invaginated portion of bowel by
prolonged pressure caused ulceration and perforation of the coats of
the enclosing bowel, the invaginated portion passing through the side
of the enclosing segment and projecting into the cavity of the
peritoneum.[Footnote 5: _Science and Practice of Medicine_.]Gangrene and ulceration, however, do not always follow intussusception.The mesenteric injuries may be sufficient to produce congestion and
exudation, and the patient survive the invagination for weeks, and
death eventually occur without sloughing or ulceration; or spontaneous
reduction of the invagination may take place and recovery of the
patient follow.The last termination must be rare, and impossible when
firm adhesion between the serous surfaces has taken place; but that it
does exceptionally occur is proved by cases where the diagnosis of
intussusception was undoubted, the invagination being felt in the
rectum or seen prolapsed through the anus.The most common termination,
if the patient survives, is mortification of the invaginated part and
separation in mass or by shreds or fragments.Intussusception may occur in any portion of the intestinal canal, but
some points are more liable to it than others.of the
cases collected by Brinton were ileo-caecal; in 32 per cent.the small
intestine alone was involved; 28 iliac and 4 jejunal; in 12 per cent.the colon, including its sigmoid flexure, was the part implicated.When the rectum is involved, it usually forms the outer layer of the
invagination, the middle and inner layers being formed by the bowel
which has passed from above into it; when prolapse of the rectum itself
occurs, the mucous membrane is generally alone involved, but along with
this the muscular coat may also descend and a true invagination of the
rectum be found.The most common variety of intussusception is the ileo-caecal.It is in
this form that we find the greatest length of bowel involved.This
invagination begins generally at the ileo-caecal valve, the lips of
which at first turn toward, and descend into, the cavity of the caecum,
drawing with them the end of the ileum; in this case the valve forms
the lowest point of the invagination.If the invagination continues,
the end of the caecum is next inverted; and if the process still goes
on, more and more of the colon is invaginated, until in some rare cases
it traverses the whole of the large intestine, appearing just above or
even protruding through the anus.In this variety the vermiform
appendix lies between the middle and inner layers of the
intussusception, and its opening, usually stretched and enlarged by the
inverted caecum and inflammatory effusion, is found close to the
ileo-caecal orifice.In this intussusception the caecum and colon are
large and roomy, and the invaginated portion not so liable, {847} as it
is when the small intestine is alone implicated, to strangulation and
sloughing; nor is there seen in ileo-caecal intussusception, unless the
portion of bowel involved is very short, the marked curvature of the
invaginated portion so commonly found in the small intestine.In the
ileo-caecal form it is twisted or much convoluted rather than bent.Another variety of ileo-caecal invagination--very rare, however--is
where the ileo-caecal orifice does not descend into the cavity of the
caecum, but the lower end of the ileum passes through the valve into
the large intestine.In this instance the invaginated portion is
tightly compressed by the valve, and strangulation is speedy and
complete.An invagination may occur in the lower part of the ileum, and
the inner and middle layers pass on to the ileo-caecal valve, and be
arrested at that point, and afterward, in consequence of violent
peristaltic action, the whole intussusception, inner, middle, and outer
layers, be invaginated into the colon.In this way the invagination
becomes doubled.While intussusception may occur in either sex and at all periods of
life, it happens nearly twice as often in males as in females, and is
most frequently seen in childhood.Leichtenstern[6] found in his
statistics of 473 cases that one-half were seen in children under ten
years old, and one-fourth of all intussusceptions occurred in children
from four to twelve months old.Invagination of the small intestine is
found almost exclusively in adults.Brinton from his records gives the
mean age of its occurrence 34.6 years.According to the same author,
the average age of ileo-caecal invaginations is 18.57 years, and
one-half of all cases of this form of intussusception observed by him
were in children under seven years of age.Leichtenstern states that
the lower part of the ileum is the most frequent site of invagination
in the small intestine, and the descending colon and sigmoid flexure
the most common portion involved in intussusception occurring in the
large intestine.cit._]

The mechanism of intussusception is probably not always the same.The
following is thought to be the most frequent process: A segment of
bowel becomes paralyzed by local peritonitis, some injury, diarrhoea,
or colic, and while in this state a segment of bowel above is subjected
to violent peristaltic action, and is forced into the unresisting
portion below.In this case the paretic segment forms the outer or
receiving layer of the intussusception.Leichtenstern believes that the
paretic portion is turned in and invaginated into the normal bowel
below, and that the clinical course of intussusception and post-mortem
appearance correspond with this explanation.If such is the case, the
paralyzed portion forms the inner layer, and the active bowel below the
receiving layer.Another theory, which applies with much force to the
most common of all invaginations--viz.the ileo-caecal--is, that as
violent anal tenesmus produces prolapse of the rectum, so prolonged and
powerful tenesmus at the ileo-caecal opening may cause prolapse of the
lips of this orifice, and, eventually, invagination of the ileum, or of
both this and the caecum, into the colon.When we remember that the
ileo-caecal valve is furnished with a sphincter muscle, the analogy is
complete.The idea so long entertained that intestinal worms may
occasion invagination of the bowel has generally been abandoned.A
polypoid tumor, by dragging down the portion of bowel to which it is
attached, may produce invagination; and {848} Brinton's statistics give
5 per cent.of cases of intussusception from this source.An
examination of a larger number of cases would probably show a much
smaller percentage due to this cause.A majority of cases of intussusception, however, take place suddenly,
without previous diarrhoea, colic, traumatism, or ill-health of any
kind, and probably occur without any tenesmus or paresis of a portion
of bowel.It may be that the longitudinal fibres of a segment of gut
contract, dilating and shortening a portion of the bowel; while this
part is distended a portion immediately above may be lengthened and
narrowed by contraction of the circular fibres, and violent peristalsis
going on at this moment, aided, possibly, by contraction of the
muscular wall of the abdomen, forces the upper and narrow segment into
the lower and dilated one.At first the invagination involves a small portion of the bowel, but,
active peristaltic action continuing, it rapidly increases in size.This increase is made at the expense of the sheath or outer layer,
which turns in to form the middle layer.The length of the invagination
varies from two or three inches to three, four, or five feet.The symptoms of intussusception generally come on suddenly, and
indicate both intestinal obstruction and inflammation.Pain resembling
violent colic, and referred to the site of the invagination, is a
prominent symptom.The pain is intense, paroxysmal in character, but
after a time it becomes continuous.At first pressure gives relief, but
in a few hours tenderness, denoting peritonitis, appears, limited to
the invagination or spreading gradually over the whole abdomen.Vomiting soon follows, and, with rare exceptions, is persistent.After
two or three days occasionally blood and sometimes fecal matter are
ejected from the stomach.Diarrhoea, with bloody, mucoid stools, is
rarely ever absent, and is characteristic of invagination.The patient
has from fifteen to twenty passages a day.If the large intestine is
involved, the diarrhoea is accompanied with tenesmus.Above the
obstruction gas and ingesta accumulate, and produce abdominal
distension, sometimes well marked.Generally the tumor formed by the
invagination can be felt through the abdominal wall, and is a symptom
of great importance.Meteorism and peritonitis may render the existence
of the tumor obscure or altogether prevent its recognition, but in
intussusception of the colon and at the ileo-caecal valve the solid
cylindrical mass can usually be found, and frequently, when the small
bowel alone is implicated, a very careful and patient examination will
enable the observer to detect it.Sometimes it changes its site, size,
and shape; occasionally it can be felt in the rectum or is seen
protruding through the anus.The urgency of the symptoms of invagination depends upon the portion of
bowel involved and the degree of constriction of the gut and its
attached mesentery.When the bowel is tightly constricted the symptoms
are acute, and the patient may die in a day or two; when the bowel is
not constricted the symptoms are chronic in character, and in the early
stages not urgent.The difference here is like that between
strangulated and incarcerated hernia.In acute cases the attack is sudden, obstruction complete, and the
symptoms those of internal strangulation of the bowel, often followed
by collapse, which may destroy life in a few hours.These cases are
{849} chiefly jejunal and iliac invaginations, and the higher up in the
small intestine the seat of obstruction the more violent and urgent the
symptoms.Constriction, being great, is followed by engorgement and
inflammation of the invaginated bowel, and if the patient lives long
enough gangrene ensues, by which the obstructing mass is separated and
discharged en masse or in fragments through the anus.Not unfrequently
life is saved in this way.That gangrene has taken place and separation
of the invaginated segments is in progress are often known by the very
fetid character of the evacuations and by their admixture with blood
and shreds of necrosed bowel.When the sequestrum has been detached
entire, it is often passed with difficulty.Frequently it lodges at
some point in the bowel, producing temporary obstruction and giving
rise to tenesmus and pain as it passes along the large intestine.There
is no doubt that the continuity of the intestine above and below the
neck of the invagination has been established, and complete cures
effected in the way already mentioned.Usually, however, the patient
dies from collapse, peritonitis, or perforation of the bowel before the
obstructing mass can be removed by gangrene.Children almost invariably
die before this can take place, and adults live from the seventh to the
fourteenth day, according to the greater or less violence and acuteness
of the symptoms.When the slough has been discharged and the continuity
of intestine established, recovery is still uncertain, and death very
often happens for reasons referred to in speaking of the separation of
the sequestrum.Separation of the invaginated portion and its expulsion, according to
Leichtenstern, in the majority of cases takes place from the eleventh
to the twenty-first day, but in chronic cases it is often delayed for
months.According to Brinton, separation of the sequestrum occurs
between the eighth and fifteenth in intussuscepted small intestine, and
between the fifteenth and twenty-second days in acute cases of
ileo-caecal and colic invaginations.In chronic cases of intussusception, which usually embrace the
ileo-caecal and colic varieties, strangulation is not common and the
course of the disease is protracted.These cases often last for several
months, and the symptoms are not always well defined.At first the pain
is paroxysmal, with long intervals of ease.Vomiting succeeds, but is
not persistent; discharge of the contents of the bowel below the seat
of lesion takes place and afterward fecal matter from above this point,
because the permeability of the bowel is not usually lost in chronic
cases.Eventually the alvine discharges become bloody, mucoid, and
characteristic of intussusception; the severity of the symptoms may
gradually increase, the pain becoming greater, more constant, the
vomiting more incessant, the discharges from the bowels more frequent,
and in one, two, or three months the patient dies from asthenia.Several authentic cases are related where the disease lasted one or two
years before terminating fatally.Very often some days before death the
pain and tenderness cease, and the operations become free from blood
and normal in character.Constipation is a prominent symptom in all of the conditions which give
rise to intestinal obstruction, and habitual constipation or loss of
the powers provided for the advance of the contents of the intestines
not unfrequently leads to permanent occlusion of the canal.It is
impossible to fix any definite rule as a standard of health for the
number and quantity of alvine evacuations.Some individuals have a
passage from the bowels once every day; others, in the enjoyment of as
good general health, suffer from the ordinary inconveniences of
constipation if they have less than two or three daily fecal
discharges; others, again, apparently equally as well, have a movement
from their bowels once in two or three days or once a week, or even
once in two weeks.Habershon[7] records the case of a "woman sixty
years old who from youth upward had had a passage from the bowels only
every six or eight days, and whose health had been perfect."A lady
under my own observation, for twenty years never had an alvine
discharge oftener than once in two weeks, and three times in her life
had passed two months without a movement of her bowels.This lady was
the mother of several children, and, although not in perfect health,
was able to attend to her ordinary household duties.Such cases are not
very uncommon, and occur, as far as I have been able to ascertain, more
frequently in women than in men.[Footnote 7: _On Diseases of the Abdomen_, quoted by Leichtenstern in
_Ziemssen's Cyc.The number of fecal evacuations and the quantity discharged have been
shown by Bischoff and Voit to depend, to some extent, upon the
character of the food ingested, vegetable diet producing abundant, and
animal diet scanty, stools.Doubtless, the quality of the food partly
explains the quantity of the alvine evacuation, although, to some
extent, this must depend upon the time that the feces remain in the
colon, a long residence there taking away a greater part of the watery
constituents and making the fecal mass thicker and harder; but the
variations in the number of stools in persons living on the same diet
can only be explained by the variations in the activity of the
peristaltic action in different individuals, or in the same individual
at different periods and under different surroundings.The causes of habitual constipation are of the most varied and
diversified character, and it is not always possible in an individual
case to point out the original or primary one.Not unfrequently several
causes are in operation at the same time to produce sluggishness of the
intestinal canal and constipation.Very often it begins with change of
scene and habits, by which the daily visit to the water-closet is
interfered with, or after confinement to bed with some temporary
indisposition.It is more likely to occur in men and women whose habits
are sedentary and who are constitutionally lazy and indolent.The feces
are allowed to remain in the rectum and colon, and every hour after the
ordinary time for going to stool diminishes the watery parts of the
fecal mass and makes it harder and more consistent.Many cases of
chronic constipation, begun in this way, have ended in dilatation and
thickening of the intestine, ulceration of the mucous membrane, and,
eventually, perforation of the coats and escape of the contents of the
gut into the peritoneal cavity.Rapid {851} excretion of water by the
kidneys, lungs, and skin produces constipation by withdrawing a large
proportion of the water from the fecal mass, rendering it unnaturally
dry and of diminished bulk.In diabetes, constipation arises from this
cause unless the patient makes up the loss by drinking an unusually
large quantity of water.Constipation in nursing-women is explained by
the loss of water in the secretion of milk.The profuse sweating which
attends malarial fever, phthisis, and other diseases readily accounts
for the constipation which often accompanies these disorders.Certain articles of food not necessary to mention here produce
constipation.They fail to excite peristaltic action; or articles of
diet which at first act as a stimulus to the bowels, and even provoke
temporary diarrhoea, lose their power if kept up too long--just as
certain purgative medicines lose their force if continued for too long
a period.Gradually they cease to increase the peristaltic action, and
rather add than otherwise to the inactivity of the intestines.Eating
the same kind of food day after day is very apt, sooner or later, to
result in diminished sensibility of the intestinal canal, a reduction
of the peristaltic force, and deficiency in the secretion of the
digestive juices, which in itself is a common cause of constipation.Frequent change of diet is generally needed to supply the stimulus
necessary for that intestinal motion which relieves the bowels.Bile is looked upon as one of the most powerful agents in stimulating
peristaltic action, and when, from any cause, mechanical or otherwise,
it is not poured into the bowel, constipation ensues.Unnatural
flexures, congenital or acquired, of the large intestine are not
unfrequently the source of chronic constipation.These flexures, normal
or factitious, favor accumulation of feces, especially in subjects who
have diminished sensibility of the bowel and a paretic state of the
muscular coat.Certain injuries and diseases of the brain and spinal
cord reduce, and sometimes altogether prevent, intestinal activity.Hysteria, if it exist for any length of time, is generally attended by
sluggishness of the bowels, and great mental depression (melancholia)
is sometimes preceded and sometimes followed by habitual constipation.In treating such a case it is important to make the distinction.Temporary paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel, followed by
symptoms of intestinal constriction, with insuperable constipation,
sometimes attends violent contusion of the abdomen.In some cases
prolonged functional weakness of the muscular coat follows the injury.Many chronic diseases leave the bowel in a sluggish condition by the
pathological changes produced in the intestine.The function of the
muscular coat is frequently injured by the infiltration which
accompanies peritonitis.The fibres are separated by the serous
effusion which attends this inflammation; they become overstretched,
and, losing their contractility, end in paralysis and obstinate
constipation.Occlusion of the canal from this cause may last for days,
and be accompanied with tympanitis, stercoraceous vomiting, and all the
signs of internal strangulation, ending in death.Post-mortem
examinations in such cases show no stricture or unnatural diminution in
the size of the canal, but that the fatal occlusion was due to
paralysis of the muscular coat of the bowel and arrest of its power.The normal advance of the contents of the bowel is interfered with by
any cause which lessens the contractility of the muscular coat.Chronic
{852} diseases which debilitate the general muscular system affect at
the same time the contractile power of the muscular coat of the canal,
and the debility and degeneration of old age are felt here, and
sometimes occasion the constipation which often accompanies this period
of life.Leichtenstern[8] says that chronic intestinal catarrh is a
common factor of constipation--that when this catarrh is of long
standing it produces relaxation of the muscular coat and diminishes the
elasticity of the intestinal walls.He believes that this pathological
condition exists in a large proportion of the cases of habitual
constipation attended with mental depression, that the hypochondriasis
makes its appearance after the constipation has become chronic, and
that it is a secondary symptom.This affection is located chiefly in
the small intestine, and does not usually involve the colon.cit._]

Probably the most common form of chronic constipation is that which
accompanies loss of sensibility and muscular inactivity of the colon
and rectum.The large bowel becomes sometimes so distended by the
accumulated fecal masses that it has been found after death to measure
ten or fifteen inches in circumference and to contain an astonishing
quantity of feces.Any part of the canal, except the last two inches of
the rectum, which is kept empty by the contraction of the sphincters,
may be occupied by the mass, but the accumulation is greatest in the
rectum, caecum, and sigmoid flexure.At the last-named location the
distension is so great that the mass can be readily felt through the
abdominal walls.The tumor may be as large as a foetal head, and may be
mistaken for a simple or malignant tumor of the omentum, stomach, or
other organ, or for pregnancy or ovarian growth.The dilatation may be
so enormous as to push the small intestines into the back part of the
abdominal cavity and to interfere with the function of any organ upon
which it encroaches.It may press upon the concave surface of the
liver, and, arresting the flow of bile, produce jaundice or
mechanically interfere with some portion of the track of the urinary
organs and <DW36> their functions.When situated in a portion of the
canal not tightly attached to the abdominal walls it is slightly
movable, more or less hard and consistent, according to its duration,
for it remains often for months unchanged, sometimes giving to the
fingers the impression of a rather soft, easily-indented swelling with
a uniform smooth surface--more often feeling like a hard, irregular,
elongated, and corrugated mass of fecal balls.Contraction here and
there of bundles of the circular muscular fibres of the gut produces
the irregular, corrugated impression imparted to the fingers.Their
shape and position may sometimes be changed by pressure through the
abdominal wall.If the accumulation occurs in the rectum, the
introduction of a tube or bougie is prevented by the impacted mass,
which can be gotten away only by the fingers or by some instrument.The
colon and rectum may be dilated to their utmost capacity with an
enormous amount of feces, enough to fill a common-sized pail, and both
the patient and medical attendant be deceived as to the sufferer's
condition by the fact that he has his daily number of stools.The
semi-fluid contents of the small intestines find their way through this
mass by some irregular and uncertain track, undermining and breaking
down sometimes a lump of the old fecal accumulation, which, if small in
size or broken up, may pass on and {853} escape by the anus, but if
large and hard may drop into the irregular and uncertain passage and
permanently close it; then sudden and complete intestinal occlusion
takes place, with all of its fearful consequences.If this, however,
should not occur, and the accumulation is not recognized and removed,
the enormous dilatation may go on until complete paralysis of the
muscular coat is produced, and entire stoppage of the current of feces,
with permanent occlusion of the bowel; or before this takes place
ulceration may set in, partly because of the great pressure of the
fecal mass upon the mucous membrane, and partly from the irritating
character of the contents of the bowel.Ulceration begins, most likely,
at some point where resistance is greatest, and perforation of the
bowel may ensue.SYMPTOMS.--If the accumulation occupies only a portion of the colon, as
the caecum or sigmoid flexure, the distended part may become displaced
and twisted on its long axis.This condition scarcely ever happens in
the large intestines except at the parts mentioned.Torsion of the
caecum rarely takes place except in persons of from forty-five to sixty
years of age, while twisting of the sigmoid flexure may happen at any
period of life.When distended and very heavy from the weight of feces,
with probably some congenital defect about its mesenteric attachment,
the sigmoid flexure may become twisted and drop into the pelvis,
producing at once symptoms of internal strangulation.Individuals accustomed to having one or more alvine evacuations a day
are made uncomfortable by two or three days of constipation.A feeling
of distension about the abdomen, with flatulence and heat, follows this
condition, and soon afterward headache, loss of appetite, and symptoms
of indigestion supervene.If this state of the bowels continues
unrelieved, pressure upon the hemorrhoidal veins takes place and
interference with venous return, producing congestion in the lower end
of the rectum.This is attended by straining, diarrhoea, evolution of
gaseous matter, colicky pains, and possibly sympathetic disturbance of
the genito-urinary organs.When at last the hardened and enlarged mass
is discharged, it produces some pain and burning about the anus, with
possibly rupture of the mucous membrane in that region.Fissure of the
anus may thus originate.In the case of a lad aged about nine years
under my care fissure of the anus began in this way, and after its
formation the pain of defecation was so intense that he resisted for
ten days every attempt of his bowels to move.After this time he passed
every day or two one or more hardened fecal balls, but always with such
atrocious pain that he looked forward to the next attempt with terror.This case ended in fecal impaction, which nearly proved fatal.Not unfrequently persons who habitually go two or three days without
having a passage from the bowels are not apparently inconvenienced, and
after a time any of the discomforts ordinarily felt from constipation
are not noticed, if indeed any exist.Generally, however, chronic constipation leads to a host of troubles of
the most varied character.There is not an organ in the body that is
not more or less influenced by it.The generation of gas in the
intestines produces a sense of fulness of the abdomen and elevation of
the diaphragm which interferes with the action of the lungs and heart.The sufferer is oppressed, sighs, and has difficult respiration and
attacks of {854} palpitation of the heart.The influence of the
abdominal pressure is conducted by the sympathetic nerves to the brain,
and the patient frequently has vertigo, headache, ringing in the ears,
faintness, etc., and in consequence of the pressure upon other nerves
or of hyperaemia of the spinal cord and its membranes he has dull
aching pains in his back, groins, genitals, or extremities.I have seen
in several instances pain in the legs, coming on after the patient has
retired and lasting until morning, violent enough to prevent sleep, at
once permanently relieved by an active cathartic after antiperiodics,
alteratives, and anodynes had failed to do any good.A patient suffering from habitual constipation usually obtains
temporary relief by the bowels acting either spontaneously or after a
dose of medicine; but, the causes of constipation continuing, the
physical discomforts and suffering continue, varied in every
conceivable way.His digestion being disturbed, appetite poor, and
assimilation imperfect, he gradually loses flesh and his complexion
becomes sallow and unhealthy.In addition to this, he soon grows
irritable and fretful, trifling affairs trouble him, he has fits of
great mental depression, and soon settles down into hypochondriasis,
his life becoming a burden to himself and a nuisance to his friends.If the constipation ends in fecal accumulation, the worst symptoms of
mechanical obstruction may present themselves at any time, and death of
the individual follow.The practitioner should always keep this fact in
mind in treating every case of intestinal obstruction, and search for
fecal impaction by examining the rectum and the whole length of the
large intestine through the anterior abdominal wall.Very often
symptoms of impaction come on gradually in one who has been ailing for
some weeks or months, but sometimes the onset is as sudden as in a case
of acute occlusion of the intestines.The patient is seized with pain
like that of colic and an urgent desire to empty his bowels, but all
attempts to do this are futile, and the straining is followed by great
exhaustion; borborygmus, nausea, vomiting, and possibly hiccough, soon
come on, with tympanitic distension of the belly.If the impaction is
not overcome, death by collapse or from peritonitis follows.Post-mortem examination shows enormous fecal accumulation, peritonitis
as a consequence of the obstruction, perforating ulcer in some part of
the large bowel, more often the sigmoid flexure, or, in some cases,
absolute rupture of the caecum itself, and escape of its contents into
the peritoneal cavity.In a report by George Pollock[9] of 127 cases of intestinal
obstruction, 77 belonged to the above class; and Brinton, in his
analysis of the whole group of cases collected by him, says stricture
constitutes about 73 per cent.In 124 cases of intestinal obstruction
reported by Mr.Bryant[10] from the post-mortem records of Guy's
Hospital, 47 were found to be stricture of the bowel.The above
statements show that stricture, or diminution of the calibre of the
bowel, is the most frequent cause of {855} intestinal obstruction, and
the subject is worthy of our earnest consideration.[Footnote 9: _Medico-Chirurgical Review_, 1853.][Footnote 10: _Practice of Surgery_.]While stricture of the bowel may be found in any portion of the
intestinal canal, it occurs most frequently in the sigmoid flexure and
rectum.Brinton found in 100 fatal cases of stricture 30 in the rectum
and 30 in the sigmoid flexure; only 8 cases in 100 were in the small
intestine.Brinton's statistics correspond very nearly with those of
other writers.The affection is more common in men than women, and the
average age at death is about forty-four years.The most common cause of stricture is contraction following
cicatrization of ulcers of the mucous and submucous coats of the
intestine.The ulcer may involve the circumference of the bowel, and
the resulting cicatrix terminate in uniform constriction of its lumen,
or the ulceration may extend several inches along the side of the
intestine, ultimately causing contraction in the direction of its
longitudinal axis, marked stenosis, and kinking of the gut.When
ulceration, continuous or in patches, involves a large extent of bowel,
it may reduce the gut to a mass of indistinguishable cicatricial
tissue.Bristowe[11] says he has seen the whole caecum thus contracted
"into a channel barely capable of admitting a goose's quill."[Footnote 11: Reynolds's _System of Medicine_.]Stricture of the intestine often follows dysentery or tubercular and
syphilitic ulceration of the bowel.Follicular or hemorrhoidal
ulceration is sometimes the beginning of a stenosis which ends in
stricture of the rectum.Stercoral ulcers of the colon are not
unfrequently the starting-point of cicatricial contraction of the
calibre of the bowel.Sometimes, but rarely, ulcers of typhoid fever
end in constriction of the intestinal tube.The diameter of the gut is
also contracted by the effects of caustic substances, by ulceration
following the lodgment of foreign bodies, and by effusion of lymph or
thickening attendant upon long-standing hernia.Very often after death
it is impossible to determine what particular kind of inflammation and
ulceration caused the stricture.Generally, the cause which provokes
the ulceration sets up chronic peritonitis, which materially aids in
producing the obstruction.Spasm of the circular muscular fibres
usually accompanies these lesions, and materially contributes in many
cases to fatal intestinal obstruction.Some authors assert that spasm
without organic change can produce acute obstruction: such an
occurrence, except possibly in the rectum, must be very rare, if indeed
it ever happens.The most common cause of stricture is cancer.This disease may
originate in the bowel itself, or, beginning in some neighboring organ
or tissue, gradually spreads and involves the gut.It may extend around
the bowel or be infiltrated along the sides of the canal for several
inches, and may be scirrhous, medullary, or epithelial in character.of the cases of cancer of the bowel are situated in
the rectum.Usually, but not invariably, cancerous deposits are found
in persons who have passed middle age.An impediment to the passage of fecal matter is invariably produced in
constriction of the intestine from the above causes, and it frequently
continues until fatal occlusion occurs.The contents of the bowel
accumulate above the block, producing distension of the gut and
thickening of the muscular coats above the stricture, with contraction
and atrophy {856} of the portion of intestine below.Dilatation of the
bowel above the seat of lesion is sometimes great enough to cause
rupture and peritoneal extravasation, or distension and stretching of
the coats of the canal may be sufficient to interfere with its
circulation, and ulceration ensue.Occasionally cases of stricture or well-marked circumscribed
contraction of the bowel are seen which give rise to no marked symptoms
of constriction during life.Such was the case in the instance related
by Bristowe and referred to above.These instances are, however,
exceptional in the large intestine.Symptoms of stricture vary according to the site, cause, and extent of
the lesion.They are gradually developed, and in this respect are
unlike the symptoms of internal strangulation or of intussusception,
which are generally acute and rapid in their course.When the
obstruction in stricture is complete, progress toward death is
comparatively slow.If the stricture is seated in the small intestine,
the symptoms are often so obscure that for a long time the presence of
the contraction may not be suspected; the contents of the small bowel
are usually fluid, and in this state readily pass through the
constricted part.The more solid the contents of the bowel, the greater
the difficulty in passing a contracted and narrow orifice, and the more
conclusive and characteristic the assemblage of symptoms of obstruction
from stricture.The history of a case of intestinal obstruction from stricture is often
instructive.For weeks or months there have been colicky pains and
intestinal disorder; possibly, in the early stages, diarrhoea, but
later marked constipation, and probably previous attacks where
constipation was for a time insuperable and death from obstruction
imminent.Hemorrhage, except in cancer or when complicated with piles,
is rare.The attack may come on suddenly, or constipation become more
and more difficult to overcome; violent peristalsis presents itself,
accompanied by pain and abdominal distension, and followed by nausea
and vomiting, the latter often being stercoraceous.During the throes
of pain--for it is paroxysmal--the outline of the distended gut can be
felt and seen through the abdominal walls if they are thin and free
from fat.Unless the stricture is relieved the patient gradually dies
from asthenia.Inflammation is often absent throughout, but enteritis
or peritonitis may come on, or perforation and peritoneal extravasation
ensue and hasten the fatal termination.When the obstruction is in the rectum it can be felt with the finger;
if in the sigmoid flexure, it may be felt with a gum bougie or probe,
but the use of the former is unreliable, and the latter, unless
carefully employed, dangerous.Obstruction at this point, however, is
attended with marked distension of the descending and transverse colon.If seated in the small bowel, the large intestine is flaccid and
collapsed.Careful manual exploration often enables the practitioner to
determine the site of the contraction.Weight, pain, dulness, and
fulness are usually found about the stricture, but these signs may be
of little value when the abdominal wall is thick and unyielding, or
peritonitis or tumor is present, or the contracted portion of bowel is
compressed or drawn out of its proper site.Brinton suggests that the
site of stricture may be determined by the quantity of water which can
be injected through the anus into the bowel.Such an estimation must
often be erroneous, as stricture {857} is rarely ever complete and
fluid may be forced through the constricted part.Indeed, Battey of
Georgia has demonstrated upon dead and living subjects that fluid may
be made to pass through the entire canal from the anus to the stomach.Obstruction due to cancer of the rectum can be determined by digital
examination.When seated in the small intestine or higher up in the
large bowel, the presence of a painful tumor, preceded for weeks by
evidences of impaired nutrition, emaciation, and followed by
lancinating pain, cancerous cachexia, etc., will indicate the character
of the trouble.Compression and Contraction of the Bowel.Obstruction of the bowel is sometimes occasioned by compression or
traction exerted on the intestine by abdominal tumors or cysts.Fibrous
tumors of the uterus, ovarian cysts, hydatid growths, or indeed any
form of abdominal tumor, may by pressure on some part of the intestinal
track produce fatal obstruction.Several inches of bowel may thus be
compressed and rendered impervious, or if traction is exerted by the
tumor, which is often adherent to the bowel, the tube may be sharply
bent or twisted and its action interfered with.A case is reported of
compression of the bowel from a great accumulation of fat about the
colon.Adhesions of intestinal coils from chronic peritoneal
inflammatory changes constitute a large and important class of cases of
intestinal obstruction.This condition is known as contraction of the
bowels: 23 of the 124 cases reported by Bryant were of this character.The usual site of stricture is the large bowel: contraction is far more
frequently seen in the small intestine, and is caused by an effusion of
lymph following simple peritonitis or the inflammation attending the
formation of cancer or tubercle of the peritoneum.Coils of intestine
are matted together or to neighboring parts in this way by bands of
lymph or false membranes, and the action of the bowel interfered with
or obstructed.Constriction of a length of bowel may be found after
death, or a sharp, angular bend by which complete obstruction has been
produced.Circumscribed peritonitis may produce adhesion of a portion of bowel by
bands of lymph to the uterus or its appendages, or to some part of the
large intestine, or to the abdominal wall, and the action of the bowel
become embarrassed by traction, constriction, or bending.In
consequence of the irritation following this condition, spasmodic
contraction may follow and add to the difficulty, or enteritis may
ensue; and this will especially be the case if the circulation of the
part is interfered with, and render complete what before was a partial
obstruction.Distension and fulness of the bowel above the obstruction,
with contraction and emptiness of the portion of the gut below, are
found after death in cases of contraction, just as we see in fatal
cases of stricture.The history of the case and presence of a tumor
will generally enable the practitioner to determine when obstruction is
due to the presence of some adventitious growth.When contraction is
complicated with the presence of tubercle or cancer, symptoms attending
these conditions will be present.Obstruction of the intestines from contraction generally comes on {858}
insidiously.The patient may date the beginning of his trouble from an
old attack of circumscribed peritonitis which probably took place weeks
or months before.He has attacks of colicky pains, indigestion, and
constipation.The last is difficult to overcome, continuing for hours
before it is relieved by medicine or the efforts of nature.During the
attack of almost insurmountable constipation violent peristaltic
movement of the bowel above the impediment may be noticed.The patient
may gradually become more and more feeble from suffering and
interference with nutrition, and die from exhaustion, or fits of
obstinate constipation may continue to recur, until finally one of them
becomes insuperable and fatal.The symptoms of contraction closely resemble those of stricture, but it
is important to distinguish one from the other, as the treatment,
especially if surgical interference is demanded, is very different.A
rigid analysis of all of the signs will usually, but not invariably,
enable the practitioner to make the distinction.There is an important difference between the constipation of stricture
and that of contraction.In the former the difficulty is in defecation,
emptying the large bowel, the usual site of stricture; in the latter
the difficulty is in the passage of the contents of the gut along the
narrowed and contracted small intestine, the common site of
contraction.In stricture the calibre of the bowel is diminished by
some sharply-defined mechanical impediment seated in the cavity or in
the walls of the tube; in contraction the bowel is bent or kinked by
adhesions, or coils of intestine are matted and glued together and
peristalsis interfered with.In stricture defecation is difficult and
painful; in contraction the alvine discharges are painless.In the
former blood and mucus are not unfrequently seen in the feces; in the
latter the motions are healthy.In stricture constipation alternates
with diarrhoea; in contraction looseness of the bowels is rarely seen.In stricture distension of the abdomen is lumbar and epigastric; in
contraction the distension is less and is central and hypogastric.In
both conditions violent distinct peristaltic action is seen during a
fit of constipation, and in both the bowel above the constriction is
distended and hypertrophied.In contraction the powerful, writhing
peristalsis involves the small intestine above the impediment, and in
stricture the large bowel above the obstruction.In both stricture and
contraction inflammation of the bowel and peritoneum may supervene.In
contraction, when inflammation sets in or when enteritis and
peritonitis are absent and the attack of constipation is
insurmountable, I have noticed that the symptoms are more urgent and
rapid in their course, and danger of death from collapse greater, than
when these conditions exist in stricture.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--In every case of intestinal obstruction a
careful examination should be made for external strangulated hernia.All of the regions of the abdomen in which hernia may occur should be
thoroughly inspected, as the symptoms of the two conditions are
identical.A small or incomplete external strangulated hernia may
easily be overlooked.An individual with an old hernia may suddenly
have symptoms of intestinal obstruction, and it may be doubtful whether
the obstruction is due to internal constriction or to the external
hernia.Diagnosis is especially difficult when the chronic hernia is
irreducible in character.If the cause {859} of the impermeability is
internal and below the external hernia, that portion of intestine in
the hernial tumor becomes swollen, tense, and hard, and closely
resembles the local symptoms of strangulated hernia.If the external
hernia is reducible, reduction en masse may take place and a
retro-peritoneal hernia be formed.When the case is doubtful and
urgent, an operation for strangulated hernia should be performed.Functional obstruction of the bowel is sometimes seen, closely
simulating obstruction from one of the structural changes mentioned.Cases of functional obstruction are seen usually in hysterical or
nervous women, and are generally recognized by the history, course, and
termination of the malady.The fact that local enteritis, peritonitis,
or typhlitis, by paralyzing a portion of the bowel, may produce all the
signs of acute and complete obstruction, should not be lost sight of.In cases of congenital stricture or malformation, or the presence of
foreign bodies in the intestine, or acute internal strangulation, or
twisting of a length of bowel, and generally in intussusception,
symptoms of acute obstruction are present.The individual may have been
in perfect health, and suddenly symptoms of the gravest character set
in.Intense pain, referred to some special part of the belly, is the
first sign of trouble.Nausea soon follows, and with it great
prostration; the depression of vital power approaches, and sometimes
reaches, syncope; the patient rolls and tosses in agony; his mental
distress is equally great, and if old enough he is conscious of his
danger and is anxious and despondent.Vomiting succeeds the nausea: at
first the contents of the stomach, and then those of the small
intestines, are thrown up; after a time the vomiting is stercoraceous.The belly becomes swollen, tympanitic, and exquisitely tender; the
weight of the bed-clothes or the slightest touch of the finger upon his
abdomen is intolerable; he keeps his head and shoulders raised and his
lower limbs retracted to avoid pressure of the abdominal muscles.If the abdominal wall is
thin, the violent motion of the intestines can be seen and felt through
it.These painful peristaltic movements of the bowel are paroxysmal and
attended by loud rumbling or gurgling noises.The pain gradually
increases; the patient is very restless and complains of great thirst;
his pulse is small, hard, and frequent, his extremities cool and
features pinched.If not soon relieved, exhaustion comes on; he has
muttering delirium, cold clammy perspiration, hiccough, twitching of
the tendons, and death soon follows from collapse or from peritonitis
or gangrene, or from both.The average period of death is from six to
eight days.It may occur in thirty-six or forty-eight hours, or the
patient may last for two weeks.In congenital occlusion and malformation the history of the case, the
age of the patient, and the fact that the deformity in such cases is
almost always confined to the anus and rectum, usually render the
diagnosis sufficiently easy.Obstruction caused by foreign bodies impacted in the intestines can
generally be diagnosed.The history of the case may show that foreign
bodies have been swallowed or that the patient has been subjected to
some of the conditions which cause the formation of enteroliths.These
stony concretions are usually found in the caecum or colon, and
frequently give rise for days and weeks to symptoms of indigestion,
emaciation, {860} constipation, and other evidences of bad health
before complete occlusion of the intestine takes place.Not
unfrequently, before the sudden attack of impermeability of the bowel
the patient has had repeated attacks of typhlitis, and has been
conscious for a long time of the presence of a tumor in the region of
the caecum or colon.Possibly he has passed on some former occasion
pieces of the stony concretion.Diagnosis of obstruction by gall-stones is often aided by the fact that
the patient has recently suffered characteristic pains of hepatic colic
and by the icterous condition of the skin.Possibly the individual has
suffered repeated attacks of hepatic trouble and has previously passed
a gall-stone.Obstruction from this cause is seen four times as often
in women as in men, and always after the middle period of life.In obstruction occasioned by internal hernia or the presence of
membranous bands, loops, mesenteric pouches, the symptoms are often
such as to baffle all attempts at accurate and certain diagnosis.The
onset of the symptoms is sudden and the course of the disease rapid;
prostration of vital power is extreme, sometimes amounting to syncope;
vomiting incessant and persistent; pain constant and fixed.The most
characteristic symptom of internal strangulation is the very great and
prolonged depression of vital power; it occurs generally in early adult
life.Erichsen states that in twisting of the bowel the abdomen is unevenly
distended, it being tympanitic on one side and flattened on the other.This condition of the bowel is usually seen after middle age.In
intussusception the principal signs are, usually, the early age of the
patient--obstruction from other causes in children being rare--the
suddenness of the onset of symptoms, the frequent desire to go to
stool, the tenesmus, and the characteristic bloody mucus discharges.By
abdominal palpation frequently the sausage-like tumor can be
recognized, and very often the intussuscepted part can be felt in the
rectum or seen protruding through the anus.When invagination involves
the upper part of the small intestine, diagnosis of the cause of
occlusion is almost impracticable.In obstruction of the bowel from fecal accumulation, inflamed and
thickened intestine, stricture, compression and traction, and
contraction of the gut from cancerous deposit, the symptoms are
gradually presented and chronic in character.They are unlike the signs
of acute obstruction, which occur in persons apparently in perfect
health and are sudden and violent from the beginning.In chronic
obstruction of the intestine the patient has probably been complaining
for some time, with symptoms of abdominal trouble.He has been unwell
for weeks, his appetite poor, digestion disordered, strength
diminished, and bowels constipated.The last symptom is the most
distressing of all.Purgatives do not give the relief ordinarily
obtained, but add to the griping, colicky pains, nausea, and general
depression.When his bowels do act, the stool is sometimes liquid,
sometimes very hard (scybalous), or the form of the matter passed is
tape-like or pipe-like.Sometimes, in his frequent attempts at stool,
the only discharge is blood and mucus or pus.Attacks of eructation and
vomiting often take place during the progress of the disease.Stercoraceous vomiting is, however, rare, and only seen in the later
period of the attack.Abdominal distension is slow in making its
appearance, but after a time is well marked, and due more to tympanitis
than to {861} constipation; the tympanitic distension is accompanied by
loud rumbling and gurgling noises in the bowels.After a period which
varies much in different cases, inflammation, suddenly or gradually, is
set up, and all the symptoms of acute obstruction are presented,
grafted on signs of chronic occlusion.We have pain, nausea, vomiting,
great distension and tenderness of the abdomen, peristalsis plainly
seen and felt if the abdominal wall is thin, the small, frequent, wiry
pulse, clammy perspiration, prostration with hiccough, tendinous
twitchings, and death, very like that following a case of external
strangulated hernia.Obstruction due to fecal accumulation generally happens in persons who
have passed middle age, and can often be diagnosed by digital rectal
examination and palpation of the abdomen, by the presence of fecal
tumors, and the history of long-existing constipation with its manifold
consequences; previous attacks of impermeability, and relief by
discharge of enormous masses of feces.Obstruction caused by the presence of some abdominal tumor is generally
known by the history of the case, the fact of the existence of the
tumor being known to the patient or discovered by the physician by an
examination through the abdominal walls or through the vagina or
rectum.The progress of such cases is essentially chronic, but acute
symptoms may at any time come on.Diagnosis of obstruction due to
stricture is frequently made by examination of the rectum and sigmoid
flexure, the usual sites of constriction from this cause.Complete
occlusion from stricture is almost always preceded by well-marked
premonitory symptoms.When the obstruction is situated in the lower part of the colon and
rectum, its precise seat can be determined by digital or manual
examination or the use of a bougie or tube.When the site of
obstruction is above the sigmoid flexure, it is difficult, and
occasionally impossible, to determine its exact locality.As a rule,
when the constriction is in the small intestine the symptoms are acute
and urgent; pain is intense, vomiting comes on soon, and prostration is
early and extreme.When the large intestine is involved, except in
volvulus, the symptoms are generally chronic.In twisting of the gut
the symptoms are rapid and uncommonly severe.The higher up the
obstruction, the earlier stercoraceous vomiting begins.Above the
constriction the bowel is distended and tympanitic; below the
constriction it is generally collapsed.In obstruction of the large
intestine the outline of the tympanitic and distended gut may be traced
with the eye and hand.In constriction of the small intestine the
secretion of urine, as has been shown by Hilton, G. Bird, and Barlow,
is less than where obstruction is seated in the large bowel.Besides
rectal and vaginal examinations, which should never be neglected in any
case of intestinal obstruction, abdominal palpation may also aid in
determining the site of constriction.It should not be forgotten,
however, when a tumor is found--as, for instance, in invagination--that
the bowel may be displaced; a distended caecum may be pushed into and
occupy the left side of the belly.Cases are not uncommon where the
symptoms are so combined and uncertain as to render accurate diagnosis
of the site of obstruction impracticable.Very little light is thrown upon the diagnosis by pain, constipation,
or vomiting when these symptoms are considered separately.Pain is
common to many diseases of the abdomen; obstinate constipation, lasting
for {862} days and weeks, is often seen where there is no mechanical
obstruction; and vomiting attends many morbid conditions of the body.But when these symptoms are combined and examined along with the
history of the case and mode of invasion, they are often characteristic
of constriction of the intestine.Pain in acute obstruction is fixed,
umbilical, and intermittent; in chronic cases it is more diffused and
increases with the distension.In acute cases constipation is complete
and insuperable; in chronic cases this symptom gradually increases; in
intussusception we have frequent discharges of a dysenteric character,
and hemorrhage, sometimes copious, when the small bowel is involved.The bowel below the seat of complete constriction may be full of fecal
matter, and the discharge of this spontaneously or by the aid of
enemata may induce the attendant not to regard the case as one of
occlusion.Stercoraceous vomiting, as a rule, comes on early in acute
and late in chronic cases of complete occlusion of the gut; in
spasmodic ileus or impermeability not due to mechanical occlusion
feculent vomiting is only occasionally seen.The duration of life in acute intestinal obstruction varies very much
in different cases: death may ensue in a few hours or not for ten or
twelve days; the average period is six days.The duration depends upon
the site of the constriction and the mechanical injury to the bowel;
the nearer to the pylorus the constriction, the more rapid the
progress.In volvulus involving the sigmoid flexure, when injury to the
bowel is great, the symptoms are acute in the extreme.After
peritonitis or enteritis begins, progress toward a fatal issue is very
rapid, the patient rarely living more than three or four days.In
occlusion from stricture, compression, fecal impaction, and chronic
intussusception the patient may live for weeks or even months.The statistics of Leichtenstern show that from 5 to 10 fatal cases of
intestinal obstruction occur every year among every 100,000
inhabitants; and according to the mortuary records of England an
average of 1 death from this cause is seen in every 260 deaths.Brinton
reports 1 death from intestinal obstruction in every 280 deaths; his
statement is based upon 12,000 promiscuous autopsies.The first author
states that the statistical reports of the general hospital of Vienna
inform us that out of 60 cases of ileus, 6 or 10 per cent.This report, however, is too meagre to be of much value.From Brinton's
statistics of 500 deaths from obstruction we find that out of 100
cases, 43 are intussusception, 17 stricture, 4.8 impaction of
gall-stones, 27.2 internal strangulation, and 8 torsion.TREATMENT.--There are few conditions of the body which cause the
practitioner more anxiety and embarrassment than cases of intestinal
obstruction, and when the precise seat and nature of the occlusion are
not known the treatment is almost entirely empirical.The distinction,
however, between acute and chronic cases of obstruction of the bowels,
or of acute supervening upon chronic symptoms, can almost always be
made, and a patient investigation of the history of the case, the mode
of invasion, and a rigid analysis of all the symptoms presented will
generally enable the attendant to come to some positive conclusion as
to the cause and site of the occlusion.One fact in the treatment which
cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind, especially of the young
practitioner, is not to use purgatives and irritating enemata, formerly
so much in vogue, {863} in the hope of forcing a passage through the
occluded bowel.The patient is urgently solicitous for medicine which
will open his bowels, but the use of purgatives to overcome internal
strangulation is as senseless and hurtful as when used to overcome the
constipation of external strangulated hernia.These agents only add to
the nausea, vomiting, pain, and peristalsis.The latter is violent
enough already to render coils of intestine visible, and with every
paroxysm is adding to the entanglement and impermeability.It is said
that cathartics in some instances have unlocked the bowel in intestinal
obstruction: these cases are exceptional, and many of them were
probably functional and not structural in character.The only exception
to the rule of avoiding purgatives is as stated by Jonathan Hutchinson:
"In certain cases when impaction of feces is suspected, and in cases of
stricture when fluidity of feces is desirable."Formerly, some of the best practitioners resorted to the exhibition of
one or two pounds of quicksilver, in the hope of overcoming intestinal
obstruction by the weight of the metal.This plan has properly been
almost if not quite abandoned.Crude mercury is very slow to reach the
obstruction, is divided into small portions by the peristalsis, which
its presence increases, and if it should finally arrive at the point of
constriction in any considerable quantity, it is more liable to add to
than overcome the difficulty.The great remedy in intestinal constriction is opium, in large or small
and repeated doses.Its use arrests the vomiting, stops the pain, and
quiets the violent movements of the bowel.Very often by it the
intestine is preserved and the life of the individual saved.No special
dose can be prescribed: it should be administered until slight narcosis
is obtained and pain and vomiting cease.Small doses of morphine, given
hypodermically and quickly repeated, is the best plan of exhibiting it.It may be given by the stomach, but under such circumstances it is apt
to be rejected, or if retained absorption goes on slowly, or possibly
not at all.If for any reason its hypodermic use is impracticable, it
had better be given by the rectum.Opium lessens the danger of death
from collapse: it gives nature an opportunity to untwist the gut in
volvulus, or to unroll it in intussusception, or to cut off the
invaginated part by gangrene; and in internal hernia, morbid adhesions,
strangulation by bands of lymph, stricture, and other forms of
obstruction, it diminishes violent peristaltic action, postpones
inflammatory infiltration, fixation of the strangulated portion, and
keeps the parts in better condition for operative interference, which
in many cases offers the only hope of relief.To carry it farther than
slight narcosis and arrest of the most painful symptoms of obstruction
is an abuse of the remedy.By such abuse the symptoms will be masked
and both patient and practitioner deceived.When obstruction is due to fecal impaction or spasm, the opium
treatment is still often indicated.Not unfrequently, after pain and
vomiting are relieved and slight narcosis kept up for some hours, the
bowels relax and spontaneous evacuation takes place.If not, discharge
of the contents of the bowel should be assisted by the administration
of castor oil, calomel, or repeated enemata of warm water.These agents
should not be used, however, as long as there is pain, tenderness of
the belly, or any evidence of peritonitis, but the opium treatment
continued until all signs of inflammation have disappeared.It has been
proposed to give {864} belladonna in place of opium; in small doses and
carefully watched it may be added to the opium, but should not be
substituted for it.The local application of ice-water or pounded ice to the abdomen has
been recommended; and it is asserted that the danger of general
peritonitis is lessened, and that the strangulation itself has
disappeared, under the influence of cold.If, however, cold increases
pain and peristalsis, it should be abandoned.The local application of
moist heat or fomentations will more probably do good and give a
grateful sense of relief to the sufferer.General bleeding should never
be resorted to, and the use of leeches, except to ward off or subdue
some local inflammation, is of doubtful expediency.Blisters,
ointments, and cups are useless in such an emergency.Cracked ice,
strong coffee, and carbonated water in small quantities are valuable in
allaying thirst and nausea.Cases are reported where obstruction of the bowels has been overcome by
the use of electricity; both the continuous and induced currents, but
chiefly the former, have been used; its value in such cases is
improbable.Abdominal taxis or massage has been earnestly recommended and
frequently practised in cases of constriction.Successful results from
this procedure have been reported.It has been attempted while the
patient was in a warm bath or under chloroform or while taking large
enemata of warm water.Abdominal traction by the use of large cups to
the belly has also been advised.We can only hope for success from
these measures in the early stages of obstruction, before inflammatory
action or fixation of the strangulation has taken place, and any
attempt of this kind should be made with tact and gentleness.Inversion
of the body has also been suggested.The injection of large quantities of warm water into the bowels to
overcome obstruction should never be omitted before resorting to
operative interference.The author has seen this plan in five or six
instances succeed after all other means had failed.Simple warm water
should be used, introduced by means of the common Davidson or a
fountain syringe.The injection should be made slowly, with occasional
intervals of rest, to allow the fluid time to pass through the
intestinal coils.During the operation the patient should be in the
knee-elbow or Sims's left lateral position, and under the influence of
an anaesthetic.One or two gallons of water may be used.In place of
water, the bowel may be inflated with air, introduced by a pair of
common bellows to the nozzle of which a piece of India-rubber tubing is
attached.The addition of castor oil, turpentine, carbonic acid gas,
and other irritants will more likely detract from than add to the
efficacy of these measures.In chronic intussusception, or in acute
cases when fixation of invagination is believed to have taken place,
and especially when inflammation is great, gangrene threatening or in
existence, injections of air or water should not, of course, be
attempted.In invagination, when the intussuscepted part is low down in the rectum
or protruding from the anus, replacement by fingers or sound should be
tried; reduction begun in this way may be completed by injections of
air or water.The propriety of introducing the whole hand into the
rectum is very questionable.In occlusion of the gut by compression and
traction the cause should be found, and, if possible, removed.An
abdominal or pelvic tumor may be pushed out of the way of the
compressed bowel, a cyst punctured, a displaced womb replaced.{865} Great care should be taken to support the strength of the patient
by concentrated and nutritious food, and in the later stages by
stimulants.When the bowels are distended by gas an injection into the
rectum of ten grains of sulphate of quinia will often give marked
relief.It has been proposed to tap the distended gut with a fine trocar when
accumulation of gas is enormous, causing dyspnoea and great general
distress; temporary relief is often obtained by this plan, which is an
imitation of a common practice among veterinary surgeons.Something
more than temporary relief may, however, follow the tapping.In
twisting of the bowel, in internal strangulation by band or loop or
ring, and in some cases of invagination, the constriction is kept up by
the enormous gaseous distension.The obstruction is continued as much
by causes within as without the intestine.When tapped and the gas
drawn off, the bowel collapses, and may escape from its constriction
and return to its natural condition.Tapping is not always certain or
safe.The trocar or aspirating tube may pass between the convolutions
and no escape of gas take place, or it may be followed by fecal
extravasation into the peritoneal cavity.Notwithstanding the risk, the
plan is a valuable one, and in suitable cases should be resorted to.SURGICAL TREATMENT.--In cases of acute obstruction of the bowel from
bands of lymph, diverticula, internal hernia, slipping of a portion of
gut into some opening, or twisting, when the treatment suggested has
been tried and fails, laparotomy should be performed; that is, the
abdomen should be laid open, the cause of the obstruction searched for,
and, if possible, removed.In acute cases a few hours, at most one day,
may be spent in trying the medical means recommended.After that time,
if the patient is not relieved, the sooner laparotomy is resorted to
the better the chance to save life.Acute internal strangulation of the
bowel from these causes has the same symptoms, course, and termination
that acute external strangulated hernia has.It demands the same
treatment--removal of the cause of the constriction.Delay in
performing the operation in the former is as certain to be followed by
peritonitis, gangrene, and death as it is in the latter; and the
surgeon who hesitates to open the abdomen and attempt to remove the
constriction in a case of acute obstruction after a fair trial and
failure of medical measures, is as culpable as the one who delays the
operation of herniotomy for unrelieved strangulated hernia.In rare instances spontaneous self-reduction of external strangulated
hernia takes place; the cases are exceptional, and the fact is no
apology for postponing herniotomy.So in occasional instances acute
internal strangulation is spontaneously relieved; here too the cases
are exceptional, and the occurrence should be no excuse for delay in
laparotomy.To justify the operation it is not necessary that the
precise site and nature of the mechanical impediment should be
determined, although this can usually be done.It is only necessary to
know that the cause of the acute obstruction is not enteritis or
peritonitis, but a constriction mechanical in character, which no
medicine or manipulation or expectant treatment can relieve.When
diagnosis is clear and laparotomy is indicated to save or prolong life
in intestinal obstruction, the aid of the surgeon should at once be
invoked.Peritonitis beginning or in actual existence
makes abdominal section more dangerous and {866} lessens materially the
chances of recovery.To make the operation absolutely the last resort
when the bowel is injured beyond repair, when peritonitis is in full
progress, gangrene threatening, or the patient on the verge of
collapse, is a useless cruelty to the sufferer and his friends, and
only serves to bring surgery into disrepute.If the truth were known,
many of the cases of death following laparotomy should be ascribed not
to the fact that the knife was used, but to the fact that it was used
too late.In intussusception not relieved by medical means the propriety of
abdominal section is questionable.The subjects of this condition are
usually children.Dislodging the invaginated bowel is not always
practicable, and the opium or expectant treatment may end in
spontaneous cure by the bowel righting itself or by sloughing of the
intussuscepted part.It is doubtless true that many of the so-called
cures from the latter process subsequently die from contraction of the
cicatrix at the site of the separation of the slough.In 43 cases
collected by Ashhurst of laparotomy for invagination, 13 recovered and
30 died.The record is bad, and to some extent the heavy mortality is
due to the fact that the operation was put off too long--delayed in
acute cases until sloughing had taken place, and in chronic cases until
adhesion of the invaginated parts had occurred.Indeed, some of the
cases reported were moribund when the operation was undertaken.Recently many successful cases have been reported, and it is fair to
presume that the percentage of recoveries in the future will be greater
than they have been in the past.In acute intestinal obstruction due to bands, internal hernia,
volvulus, or the presence of foreign bodies, as gall-stones, there is
no question that laparotomy should be performed after other measures
for relief have been employed and failed.Death in such cases is
inevitable and imminent, and operative interference should not be
postponed until peritonitis has set in.After the abdominal cavity has
been opened the distended gut can easily be found and the fingers of
the operator carried on down until the site of the constriction is
reached and the cause of the obstruction discovered.If the
constriction is due to the presence of bands or adhesions, they should
be cut or broken up and the gut relieved.If an internal hernia is
found or a portion of bowel has slipped into some fissure or pocket, it
should be withdrawn and the parts restored to their natural position.If the cause of the obstruction is a volvulus, the bowel should be
untwisted.If a foreign body is felt impacted in the bowel and closing
it, unless it can be readily and without danger of lacerating the coats
of the gut pushed on by the fingers of the operator until it has passed
the ileo-caecal valve, the foreign body should be removed from the
bowel by an incision and the wound in the bowel afterward closed by
sutures.If the case is one of intussusception, the invaginated parts
should be pulled out: this is practicable where adhesions are absent or
slight, but if the adhesions are very firm, and it is impossible to
restore the parts to their natural position, the gut should be laid
open above the occlusion, the edges of the opening should be attached
to the margin of the external wound, and a fecal fistula established.If the case of acute obstruction be due to stricture of the small
intestine, which is exceedingly rare, the gut may be laid open, and the
patient recover with fecal fistula, or entorectomy or resection of the
diseased part of the gut be resorted to.The operation of entorectomy
has been recommended by many {867} surgeons, and a large proportion of
the cases reported recovered.In one case by Koeberle six and a half
feet of the gut were successfully excised.The following table by Ashhurst[12] shows the results of laparotomy.It
will be seen that in 230 cases 68 recovered:

[Footnote 12: _Surgery_, p.Enterotomy is an operation originally performed by Nelaton.It is done
by making an incision, preferably in the right groin, above the crest
of the ileum and parallel with Poupart's ligament.When the abdomen is
opened a coil of intestine is found and carefully stitched to the walls
of the incision.A very small opening is then made into the bowel, and
a fecal fistula established.Enterotomy is less dangerous than
laparotomy, as by it there is less interference with the peritoneum;
but no relief could be afforded by this procedure in cases of
intussusception or acute obstruction from bands, hernia, or volvulus.It is applicable to cases of intestinal constriction when the
obstruction is about the lower part of the small or upper part of the
large intestine.It may be resorted to as a palliative measure when
exact diagnosis as to the character and site of the obstruction is not
clear, the case being otherwise hopeless, or in cases of obstruction
where severe symptoms persist and death is near, and yet for any reason
laparotomy or colotomy is inapplicable; or it may be performed in cases
of contractions after failure of patient and persistent medical
treatment.Many successful cases of enterotomy have lately been
reported, and the operation has been earnestly advocated by Trousseau,
Maunders, Wagstaffe, Bryant, and others.In chronic constriction due to
stricture or other mechanical obstructions, malignant or otherwise, not
remediable by any medical measures, colotomy should be performed.By
this operation the colon is opened and an artificial anus established.The sigmoid flexure in the left lumbar region is the part selected for
the colotomy if the obstruction is situated in the gut below that
point.When the obstruction is higher up in the colon or its exact site
cannot be determined, the caecum in the right lumbar region is the part
chosen.In cases of obstruction from the mechanical pressure of tumors,
the possibility of relieving the compressed bowel by treating the
tumors should of course be considered before resorting to colotomy.{868}

CANCER AND LARDACEOUS DEGENERATION OF THE INTESTINES.BY I. E. ATKINSON, M.D.The term cancer of the intestines is used here in a clinical sense to
designate new formations in the intestinal tract the tendency of which
is to destroy life, and has no reference to the histological characters
of the tumors, inasmuch as these are, during life, for the most part,
concealed from the eye of the pathologist.It so happens, however, that
in a histological as well as in a clinical sense the term is
appropriately applied to all but a very few of the malignant new
growths that develop in the parts under consideration, if we adopt, as
seems proper, the opinion of most modern pathologists, that cancer or
carcinoma should only include those tumors "consisting of cells of an
epithelial type, without any intercellular substance, grouped together
irregularly without the alveoli of a more or less dense fibroid
stroma."Carcinoma of the intestines appears either as cylindrical-cell cancer,
as scirrhus, or as gelatinous or colloid cancer.Scirrhous cancer of
the intestines may resemble in appearance and texture the ordinary
medullary cancer, degrees of hardness or of softness depending upon the
predominance of the stroma or of the cellular elements in the
constitution of the tumor.Rarely, and in a purely clinical sense,
cancer of the bowels may exist as a lympho-sarcoma in the small
intestine, and then through progression from the glands of the
mesentery or elsewhere.Primary intestinal sarcoma has, however, been
observed.Similarly, melano-sarcoma has been detected in the intestine
as secondary to this form of sarcoma, originating in the skin or in the
eye.Of the forms of carcinoma, cylinder-cell cancer is the most frequent.Carcinoma gelatinosum or colloid cancer is of great relative frequency,
but it is altogether probable that here, as elsewhere, this represents
a degenerative form of ordinary carcinoma.At all events, it is certain
that it may be detected in many cases where the essential changes
reveal the ordinary glandular or cylinder-cell variety.These forms of
cancer may affect the bowel primarily or secondarily by extension from
adjacent organs and textures, or by metastasis.Primary cancer occurs
most frequently, metastatic cancer with great rarity.The relative
frequency of the different forms of cancer is not definitely known.In
the article on carcinoma in the _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des
Sciences medicales_ (xii.576, 577) cancer of the bowels is said to
constitute about 8 per centum of all carcinomatous new growths.Sibley[1] found that primary {869} carcinoma occurred in the alimentary
canal (exclusive of the mouth, tongue, and the annexed organs) in 6 per
centum of the cases collated by him.Tauchou's compilations of nine
thousand fatal cases of carcinoma show that intestinal cancer was
present in 4 per centum.[2] These computations include cancer of the
rectum.If statistics of cancer of the bowels exclusive of rectal
cancer were available, they would show, doubtless, a much smaller
proportion.[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chir.Transact._, xlii., 1859.][Footnote 2: Leube, _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, vii.Any portion of the intestinal tract is liable to be attacked by cancer,
though undoubtedly some parts of it with much greater frequency than
others.Kohler[3] reported that in thirty-four cases the cancer was
situated twenty-two times in the large intestine (the rectum excluded)
and twelve times in the small intestine (nine times in the duodenum).It is not unlikely that in the cases of duodenal cancer the new growth
extended from the pylorus.At all events, primary cancer is seated with
far greater frequency in the large intestine, and, not including the
rectum, usually in either the sigmoid flexure or the caecum.Grisolle[4] declares the large intestine to be four times more often
affected with cancer than the small intestine; that the sigmoid flexure
is attacked as often as all the rest of the colon taken together; and
that the caecum is still more often affected.Where the intestinal new
growth is secondary to carcinoma elsewhere, it is usually so by
extension from neighboring parts; thus, the ileum may become implicated
by contact with uterine cancer, etc., and cancer of the stomach, liver,
kidney, etc.[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vii.[Footnote 4: _Pathologie int._, 1865, ii.]Cancer of the intestines usually begins after the middle period of
life, and apparently irrespective of sex.Nevertheless, young persons
are occasionally affected, and children sometimes develop malignant new
growths of the bowels (usually sarcomatous), either primarily, which is
rare, or secondarily, by extension from other parts.The influence of
heredity seems not to be well established.There can be no doubt that
chronic irritation may act as an exciting cause of cancer of the
bowels, as it may in cancer of other parts.It has been impossible to
recognize any specific influence from especial forms of irritation, and
it is not likely that such exist.Indeed, the etiological relations of
intestinal cancer remain exceedingly obscure.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--Up to a certain period of development cancer of the
bowels will give no sign of its presence; indeed, cases have been
observed where, death having occurred from other causes, the existence
of the malady became apparent only at the necropsy.In all cases the
symptoms are, at first, of an indefinite character and very inconstant.Vague abdominal pains are experienced; these gradually tend to become
referable to a certain locality and to become associated with irregular
action of the bowels.Constipation, alternating with short intervals of
diarrhoea, supervenes, and a varying amount of meteorism is developed.These symptoms may be attended by the signs of failing nutrition.The
body gradually shows the effects of chronic imperfect assimilation, and
becomes emaciated.The complexion slowly assumes the peculiar hue of
chloasma cachecticorum.Long before this occurs, however, the cancerous
new formation usually becomes perceptible as a more or less distinct
abdominal tumor, movable or fixed, as the part affected permits of free
movement {870} or is bound down to the neighboring parts either by
normal attachments or by adhesions resulting from inflammatory
processes or from the extension of the cancerous growth.When the tumor
is movable, it is generally situated in the small intestine or
transverse colon or sigmoid flexure, the other portions of the
intestinal canal being comparatively fixed.It should be mentioned,
however, that portions of the intestines normally freely movable may
become adherent to contiguous parts, as the transverse colon, with the
gall-bladder, liver, stomach, spleen, etc.; the transverse colon
and small intestine, drawn down by the weight of the new growth, with
the pelvic organs, the bladder, uterus, uterine appendages, etc.; and
that, finally, different portions of the bowels may become involved in
one mass.When the duodenum is the portion implicated the tumor may escape
observation or may be indistinguishable from cancer of the pylorus.It
occasionally happens that no tumor can be discovered until the malady
is far advanced whatever part of the bowel is affected.In nearly all
cases, however, before very long the tumor will be detected wherever
situated, but it will often remain difficult, owing to its situation,
to arrive at exact conclusions as to its precise character.Usually, it
offers considerable resistance to the touch, but its features may
readily be obscured by the fecal accumulation that forms above the
constricted portion of the gut and by the gaseous distension of the
bowel.This tumor will be slightly painful to pressure, and the patient
will refer to it a spontaneous pain, usually of a dull aching,
sometimes of a stabbing, character.Percussion yields a sound of
muffled resonance, due to the tubular nature of the tumor.Cancerous
neoplasms of the bowel, and of the duodenum especially, are apt to be
associated with a distinct pulsation caused by the subjacent abdominal
aorta.This may readily be distinguished from aneurismal pulsation by
the absence of an expansile character, by the disappearance of the
impulse that may sometimes be observed when the patient is made to
kneel upon all fours, and by the occasional mobility of the cancerous
tumor.By extension and by inflammatory infiltration the tumor
frequently becomes converted into a conglomerate mass where all
determination of locality becomes conjectural.The tumor is, with very
rare exceptions, single.The symptoms that accompany the development of these growths depend
mostly upon their position in the alimentary tract.Pain alone seems
independent of this, but is at best a most uncertain concomitant.When
the duodenum is the part affected by extension from the pylorus, the
symptoms are indistinguishable from ordinary pyloric cancer.Even
primary cancer of this part may exactly simulate pyloric cancer.The
localized pain and tumor, the vomiting after meals, the frequent
presence of blood in the vomited matters, the progressive emaciation
from starvation, the absence of abdominal distension (a result of the
constriction of the gut at its upper extremity), the gastric
dilatation,--all combine to make the diagnosis difficult.Cancer of the duodenum in its descending part may be suspected when
signs of hepatic and pancreatic obstructive difficulties point to
implication of the ducts, through which are produced jaundice upon the
one hand, and evidences of imperfect pancreatic digestion, in the
presence of undigested fat in the stools, upon the other.In the lower
portions of the {871} intestines the cancer becomes more and more
associated with meteorism and fecal accumulations.Constipation becomes
steadily more obstinate, but there are occasional fluid evacuations
containing blood, pus, and mucus, often stinking abominably.When the
tumor is toward the end of the large intestine--in the sigmoid flexure,
for example--fluid discharges occur with very great frequency at times;
but these are scanty in amount and but slightly fecal in character.In
these cases one does not usually observe the compressed, ribbon-like
stools that are seen in rectal cancer.These symptoms may precede the
appearance of the tumor, when the diagnosis will be less readily made.The constipation will at first be more amenable to the use of
purgatives.(It is said to be due more to a loss of contractility of
the bowel than to the narrowing of its lumen.)Gradually these will
lose their efficacy, and finally complete obstruction of the lumen of
the gut is effected; in which event the symptoms of ileus will develop,
with cramps and vomiting, finally of a fecal character, and the fatal
issue quickly follow.Not unfrequently peritonitis is developed, and
may be of a chronic character or may destroy life within a day or two,
or the patient may die from exhaustion before the obstruction becomes
complete.It may happen that the integument will become involved in the malignant
process, or may become continuous with the tumor by adhesive
inflammation.In such cases an opening may be formed by suppuration, or
the lancet may secure the passage of feces through an artificial anus,
and temporary respite be obtained.Sometimes a sudden disappearance of
the symptoms of obstruction--a result due to the softening and breaking
down of the cancerous mass, restoring temporarily the integrity of the
intestinal tube--may give an unjustifiable hope to the patient; or the
same effect may follow the establishment of a communication, by
ulceration, between the bowel above the tumor and some portion nearer
to the anal orifice.The progress of the new growth soon annuls the
benefits thus gained.Not uncommonly, particles of the cancerous mass may become detached,
and, if diligently searched for, may be discovered in the feces.Microscopic examination may then definitely determine the nature of the
disease.It has been claimed that colloid cancer may be diagnosticated
in this manner even before the appearance of other symptoms.[5] Death
may be hastened by the occurrence of metastatic deposits in other and
vital organs.Oedema of the lower extremities (of the left extremity in
cancer of the sigmoid flexure) will often be observed as a result of
the interference of the cancerous mass with the return of blood from
the extremities by pressure upon the large veins.The combination of
pain, tumor, constipation, tympanitis, progressive wasting, and the
cachexia that sooner or later supervenes, stamps eventually most cases
with unmistakable characters.[Footnote 5: Charon and Ledegank, _Journ.lxviii., 1879, p.The duration of intestinal cancer may extend from several months to
one, rarely two, years, the latter age sometimes being attained by
colloid cancer, the most chronic and least malignant form.MORBID ANATOMY.--By far the most frequently encountered malignant new
growth of the bowel is carcinoma, in one or another of its forms.The
cylinder-cell epithelioma is probably the most common of {872} these,
and, as seen in the intestine, offers many naked-eye points of
resemblance with ordinary encephaloid carcinoma.It is soft, filled
with a milky juice, and may attain considerable size.The tumors appear
as discoid prominences of varying size and number.Later, these may
become fungoid and ulceration ensue.The growths early involve the
whole intestinal wall, and by their increase tend to obstruct the
passage of the intestinal contents.When ulcerated they present a
nodular, uneven surface, situated upon a thickened base consisting of
the infiltrated coats of the bowel.Villous prolongations (villous
cancer; the undestroyed connective-tissue stroma) may project into the
lumen of the bowel and give a peculiar tufted appearance to the part
implicated.One or more points may be invaded by cancerous growth, and
above each will be developed a dilatation of the gut (the result of
distension) containing uncertain quantities of fecal matter, upon the
removal of which the tumor will appear much smaller than it appeared
during life.Scirrhus usually implicates the gut in its entire circumference, so
that a high degree of constriction may result from a small amount of
cancerous infiltration.It begins as small nodules or plates upon the
mucous membrane.As commonly observed, the lumen of the intestine is
narrowed by an annular band of gristly hardness.All the coats of the
bowel, with the peritoneum, become involved, and frequently the
contiguous parts are included in the cancerous infiltration, forming an
undefinable mass through which the contracted channel of the bowel may
be traced, though often impervious to any but the smallest articles (a
crow-quill, for example).The surface of the gut is generally
ulcerated, irregular, and nodular.The walls of the ulcer are irregular
and infiltrated.It will sometimes happen that the autopsy reveals
permeability of the bowel where total obstruction prevailed during the
latter days of life.This may be probably accounted for by the
disappearance of the hyperaemia that doubtless existed during life and
caused more or less turgidness of the growth.Sometimes the
connective-tissue element is less predominant, and gives place to a
more or less luxuriant cell-development; in a word, scirrhous carcinoma
is replaced by soft or encephaloid cancer.This difference is simply
one of degree, but is associated with greater rapidity and extent of
growth.Ulceration is extensive, and one may here also often discover
the villous, tufted appearance of villous cancer, caused by the
fringe-like shreds of stroma entangling cellular elements not yet
detached from the mass.Colloid cancer, or carcinoma gelatinosum, may be associated with either
of the above-described forms as a degenerative form, or may,
apparently, develop as such from the beginning.It is a very frequent
variety of the malady.In 27 cases of intestinal cancer, colloid cancer
was present in 5, as reported by Lebert.It is most often observed in
the sigmoid flexure and caecum, as are the other forms of carcinoma.It
is composed of a considerable mass extending around the bowel.Ulceration is less often found here than in the other forms, nor is
there the same tendency to secondary infiltrations.By the unaided eye
an alveolar structure may be detected, and when the mass is extensive a
soft, jelly-like consistency is presented, together with "a bright,
honey-yellow color."Small deposits of the colloid matter may be seen
upon the surface.These have been described as resembling wheals of
urticaria or herpetic or eczematous {873} vesicles (Bristowe).The
glairy fluid of colloid carcinoma oozes from the cut surface of the
tumor, bathes it, and is to be found in the intestine.These different forms of cancer sooner or later invade neighboring
parts, as the peritoneum, mesenteric and retro-peritoneal glands, and
adjacent organs.On the other hand, the intestines may become invaded
by cancer of the peritoneum and other parts.It has even been observed,
reversing the usual order of things, as secondary to cancer of the
liver (Wilks and Moxon).Under these conditions the symptoms of
intestinal cancer will have been associated with those due to the
primary affection.Lympho-sarcoma will rarely be found as an extension
from the lymphatic glands and involving the small intestine.Melanotic
sarcoma may occur as metastatic from an original melano-sarcomatous
tumor of the skin or eyeball.DIAGNOSIS.--In its earlier stages it is impossible to recognize cancer
of the intestines.After its symptoms have become established they may
resemble those of several disorders.Cancer of the duodenum cannot be
distinguished from that of the pylorus unless evidences of pancreatic
or biliary disturbances indicate obstruction to the passage of the bile
and pancreatic secretions.Previous to the appearance of a tumor one
must often remain in doubt.The alternations of constipation and
diarrhoea, the signs of partial obstruction, the localized pain usually
present, the gradual wasting, will arouse suspicions of cancer, though
chronic inflammatory affections of the bowels may induce symptoms not
altogether unlike these.The presence of a tumor will supply the
additional evidence necessary for a definite diagnosis.It will be
necessary to exclude fecal enlargements of the bowels.The cancerous
tumor will be somewhat painful, hard, nodulated.A tumor due to fecal
accumulation may closely simulate it, and is, indeed, usually
associated with it.By manipulation the fecal mass may be moulded, and
even displaced, and by appropriate purgative treatment may be caused to
entirely disappear.Foreign bodies, mesenteric tumors, and other
abdominal enlargements may offer physical resemblances to intestinal
cancer, but their symptomatology is usually so different that doubt may
be easily dispelled.Syphilitic gummy infiltration, with resulting
stricture, is more apt to occur in the rectum than in other parts of
the alimentary tract.The presence of fragments of the new growths may sometimes be detected
in the stools, when microscopic examination will determine their
nature.With cylinder-cell epithelioma and glandular cancer this is not
common, but with colloid cancer much information may be gained by
examining the evacuations.According to Charon and Ledegank,[6] colloid
cancer of the intestine may be detected before symptoms develop, by the
presence of colloid matter in the feces.In the later stages, however,
the gelatinous change of all the histological elements may occasion
embarrassment, as at this stage the peculiarities of the cellular
structure will have been destroyed.et de Pharm._, lxviii., 1879.]PROGNOSIS.--Intestinal cancer always proves fatal.Death may result
from the debility resulting from the cancerous cachexia or from
intestinal occlusion or from peritonitis.The duration of the malady is
usually not long.It runs its course in from several months to one,
rarely to two, years.{874} TREATMENT.--Treatment must be directed to the alleviation of the
distress caused by the disease.When
the cancer is situated in the colon, especially in the sigmoid flexure,
the operation for artificial anus often affords great though temporary
relief.The diet should consist of such articles in the digestion of
which a large residue is not formed.Milk, eggs, soups, etc.should
compose the principal articles of food.Mild laxatives will be required
to secure the proper evacuation of the bowels, and to relieve pain and
discomfort opium is invaluable and should be freely used.When
obstruction is imminent nutrient enemata afford the most efficient
means of administering nourishment.Lardaceous Degeneration of the Intestines.SYNONYMS.--Albuminoid degeneration, Waxy degeneration, Amyloid
degeneration, etc.Lardaceous degeneration of the intestines is an affection of quite
frequent occurrence in those persons who are the subjects of a like
change elsewhere; for although it has been asserted that it may be
present as a primary affection, it almost always succeeds the same form
of degeneration in other organs.Since, for the most part, it only
makes itself manifest at an advanced stage of the disease, its
importance is usually masked by the grave constitutional condition of
the patient, whose vital forces are wellnigh exhausted by the already
advanced degenerations present elsewhere.The extensive implication of
other organs and tissues in the same degenerative process also creates
great obscurity in the symptomatology of intestinal lardaceous disease,
and is doubtless the cause of the existing dearth of definite knowledge
upon the subject.That the intestines are comparatively frequently involved in lardaceous
disease is shown by dead-house statistics.Thus, Charlewood Turner[7]
reported from the London Hospital that in 58 cases of lardaceous
disease the intestines were affected 10 times; and Goodhart[8] in 150
consecutive necropsies of lardaceous disease at Guy's Hospital reported
implication of the intestines 63 times.[Footnote 8: _Ibid._, p.Although the bowels do not become affected as early as several other
parts, they will almost certainly become involved should the patient's
life be prolonged; and in those cases where death is a direct result of
the degeneration the intestines share with the kidneys the chief
responsibility.It is not, however, until an advanced stage of
lardaceous degeneration that its presence in the alimentary canal is
revealed by symptoms; indeed, many cases do not, throughout life,
betray evidences of the pronounced alterations that are to be
discovered after death.Even in extreme cases there are no symptoms
that would, even with probability, be referred to lardaceous disease of
the bowels in the absence of the same degeneration in other organs and
parts.There are, then, no specific symptoms following lardaceous
degeneration of the bowels.Where the normal functions of the intestines can no longer be properly
performed in consequences of the changes that have taken place in them,
there results a moderate diarrhoea.At first the number of movements
{875} may not be increased; the evacuated matters are fluid and of a
greenish or pale color.Usually, little or no pain is experienced,
though at times and in certain individuals this may be severe and
colicky.The diarrhoea is not always steadily progressive, but may from
time to time disappear.With the progress of the disease it may become
more free and persistent, and in the later stages hemorrhage from the
bowels may be superadded.This may vary in amount, and where, as is
often the case, the stomach participates in the degeneration,
haematemesis may also appear.These hemorrhages may be insignificant,
or may at once assume alarming proportions, and even bring to an
unexpected termination the life of the individual.Already, at the
outset of the intestinal symptoms, the general health will have shown
evidences of profound alteration, but upon the supervention of the
diarrhoea more rapid progress will be observed, consequent upon the
increased nutritive disturbance.The use of remedies in temporarily
controlling this diarrhoea may prolong for months the life they are
powerless to save.So far as concerns the intestinal affection, there is no special
tendency toward febrile excitement.It must not be forgotten, however,
that acute inflammatory attacks of various tissues and organs
frequently arise in the course of lardaceous disease.Though there seems to be reason to believe that mild degrees of
lardaceous degeneration may sometimes be cured, especially when
dependent on syphilis, there is but little hope of arresting its
progress at the late stage when the bowels become implicated.Indeed,
when pronounced degeneration of the bowels takes place the disease is
usually nearing the end of its course; for it is a well-settled fact
that in this degeneration extensive implications of organs may occur
without markedly reducing the patient's general condition, so long as
the kidneys and intestines remain unaffected.The cause of death is
usually to be traced to these organs.Dickinson[9] found that in 35
cases where death was apparently due to renal lardaceous disorder, the
immediate result was brought about by diarrhoea in 13 cases.Presumably, in a large proportion of these lardaceous disease of the
bowel was present.[Footnote 9: _Diseases of Kidney_, Part ii., 1877, p.The degeneration usually affects the lower portion of the small and the
upper part of the large intestine.Occasionally it will be found to
have invaded the whole alimentary tract.As in lardaceous degeneration
generally, the process begins in the small arteries and capillaries and
veins, affecting primarily the arterial and venous muscular coats--not,
however, according to the latest authorities, the muscular fibres
themselves, but their perimysium and the cement substance, the
degeneration being one limited to the connective tissues.[10] In the
mildest cases only some of the small vessels of the mucous membrane are
involved, and no naked-eye changes can be detected.In more advanced
stages the mucous membrane is pale and shows evidence of catarrh.Thickening occurs, and as the process advances a peculiar appearance is
revealed which has been compared to that of wet wash-leather (Wilks).The iodine test now gives the mahogany- reaction of lardaceous
matter, with the tissues affected, or, if the methyl-aniline-violet
test of Cornil be employed, the lardaceous material will display a
red-violet color, while {876} normal structures will be tinged
blue-violet.It is said to be better to make the test near a Peyer's
patch, since the latter is seldom affected by the degeneration, and
brings out, by contrast, the surrounding lardaceous material.[11] This
distribution of the material cannot be considered as constant, however,
since Hayem found the patches of Peyer most frequently affected.[Footnote 10: Cohnheim, _Allgem.[Footnote 11: Wilks and Moxon, _Path.404; Kyber, _Virchow's
Archiv_, Bd.In more advanced stages the surface may become irregular from glandular
enlargement, and ulceration may occur.Microscopic examination shows
the lardaceous material in the vessels, and also in the stroma of the
mucous membrane and villi.[12] The epithelium is not involved.The
degeneration, at first confined to the mucous membrane, extends to the
submucous tissue, the proper muscular coat of the intestines being
often implicated--so far, at least, as concerns its connective tissue.In the more severe cases Hayem found the agminated and solitary glands
extensively involved.Fine branches from affected vessels penetrate to
the interior of the glands.In such cases the mesenteric glands will be
found implicated.The degeneration of the vessels running through the
gland structure causes disappearance of this substance by fatty
degeneration, and occasions a reticulated arrangement of the lardaceous
material, and, secondarily, ulceration.In a similar manner ulcers may
arise in any part of the affected tract.Finally, the lardaceous
material may involve the whole thickness of the gut.[Footnote 12: Eberth, _Virchow's Archiv_, 80, S.The diagnosis of lardaceous disease of the bowels can only be made with
certainty in the presence of pronounced albuminoid disease of other
parts in association with the symptoms of intestinal disorder.Inasmuch as the disorder invades the bowels only at a late stage of its
existence, the prognosis acquires additional gravity.It is probable
that advanced albuminoid disease is never cured; so much the more
hopeless is it when affecting this tract.If unchecked, the diarrhoea
rapidly saps the powers of life; if temporarily alleviated, the
approach of death is more gradual.Whatever attempts are to be made to cure the disease, they must be
through the general system, and are identical with those directed
toward the cure of lardaceous disease generally.Treatment directed to
the intestines must be palliative.The diarrhoea must be combated by
appropriate diet and the administration of such remedies as protect the
surface of the mucous membrane and control the intestinal movement.Bismuth subnitrate in large doses is therefore indicated.Various
astringents may be employed, while the use of opium often secures most
gratifying relief.Preparations
of the crude drug seem to answer better than its salts.The necessity
of keeping the gut free from undigestible matters that may irritate the
already badly-damaged mucous membrane is apparent.Patients with this
form of lardaceous degeneration usually show the cachexia resulting
from profound modifications of nutrition, and their intestinal symptoms
can only be regarded as links in a long pathological chain.Hemorrhage
will call for remedies that under ordinary circumstances are employed
to control bleeding from the bowels.{877}

DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.BY THOMAS G. MORTON, M.D., AND HENRY M. WETHERILL, M.D., PH.G.Diseases of the inferior and terminal portion of the large intestine
may be divided into primary and secondary--the former when the morbid
cause is local and independent of disease elsewhere, the latter when it
is consequent upon or incident to some other bodily affection.Among
the primary lesions may be classed congenital malformations, prolapse
of the rectum, hemorrhoids, and some varieties of new growths; also
diseases caused by local irritations, infection, or traumatism, such as
proctitis, ulceration, fissure, non-malignant stricture, chancroidal
invasion and primary syphilis, including obstruction of the bowel by
impacted feces and foreign bodies.Thread-worms and various cutaneous
eruptions about the anus may also be included among the causes of the
primary diseases of this portion of the alimentary canal.The secondary affections are quite numerous, and may be caused by
direct extension of disease from the colon, as in the dysentery
following typhoid fever, and follicular enteritis, or entero-colitis of
children; by contiguity, from diseases in neighboring organs--_e.g._
ischio-rectal abscess causing fistula--or by changes in the nervous or
vascular supply, such as is seen in spasmodic contraction, paralysis,
epidemic dysentery, cholera, and the action of certain remedies.The rectum, the third or terminal portion of the large intestine, has
no sharply-defined upper limits: it is usually understood to begin at
the sigmoid flexure, opposite the left sacro-iliac symphysis; it is
from six to eight inches in length and terminates in the anus.As the
sigmoid flexure is the narrowest portion of the colon, so the calibre
of the first part of the rectum is narrower than the portion below,
where it gradually becomes more commodious, and near the anus presents
a peculiar condition of the walls which gives it a capacity for
remarkable distension.The rectum, which is somewhat cone-shaped, in
its anatomical and pathological characters retains those of the large
intestine with slight variation.Upon the upper or first part of the
rectum the duplicature of the peritoneum is continued, forming the
meso-rectum, which invests the bowel, attaching it to the sacrum.Below
this the middle portion of the rectum (extending to the tip of the
coccyx) is attached to the sacrum by connective tissue only, but also
has a peritoneal investment on the upper portion of its anterior
surface.{878} The third or terminal part of the rectum, which is only an inch
and a half in length, and is entirely without peritoneal covering,
terminates at the anus.The circular and transverse muscular fibres,
mucous crypts, and appendages throughout the rectum are identical with
those above, except that the general muscular tunic is thicker; but the
longitudinal fibres are less distinctly aggregated into bands than in
the colon, being disposed in a more uniform manner, except that, like
the circular fibres, they are especially aggregated between the
sacculi.The fact that the meso-rectum limits the mobility of the upper
and more narrow part of the rectum has led some to locate a third
sphincter at this point, but the existence of such an organ has not
been generally admitted.Van Buren characterizes it as an organ which
"anatomy and physiology had been equally unsuccessful in assigning
either certainty of location or certainty of function."[1]

[Footnote 1: Kelsey, _Diseases of the Rectum and Anus_, New York, 1882,
p.The anus guards the outlet of the bowel by its double sphincter muscle,
which under normal circumstances affords voluntary control, within
certain limits, over defecation.The well-known peculiarity of the
vascular supply, a sort of erectile tissue being formed by the inferior
hemorrhoidal plexus and the passage of some of the efferent veins
through the sphincter muscle, by which they are subjected to pressure,
is very favorable to the development of certain forms of disease which
will be considered among the local disorders.As embryology has thrown
considerable light upon the pathology of morbid growths by
demonstrating relationships that were previously unsuspected, so a
consideration of the development of the lower portion of the intestinal
canal may lead to a better understanding of some of its diseases,
especially those which are symptomatic or secondary.In early foetal
life the third division of the primitive intestine, the pelvic portion,
terminates in a cloaca in common with the urachus; subsequently, about
the eighth week, a partition (the perineum) is formed which divides the
cavity into two portions, the uro-genital sinus and the anal cavity.In
the mean time, at an early period a depression occurs on the cutaneous
surface at the site of the anus, which deepens progressively until it
encounters the primitive intestine, with which it unites at the end of
the fourth week, and the continuity of the tube becomes established.It
therefore is seen that the rectum in its upper and middle portions is
derived from the internal and middle layers of the blastodermic
membrane, while its lower third, with the anus, like the buccal cavity,
is formed by the external and middle layers.In its diseases, then, the greater part of the rectum would seem to
naturally participate in those of the large intestine, to which it
structurally belongs, while its inferior portion and the anus would
partake more in the disorders of the general cutaneous system.This
peculiarity of development also explains the difference noticed in the
vascular supply.The rectal veins are usually divided, like the rectal
arteries, into three sets--superior, middle, and inferior.They are
arranged so as to form two distinct venous systems, the rectal
returning its blood through the inferior mesenteric veins into the
portal system, the anal terminating in the internal iliac.The first
system is made up of the superior hemorrhoidal, the second of the
remaining veins.The superior hemorrhoidal forms a venous plexus which surrounds the
{879} internal sphincter muscle; the inferior hemorrhoidal vein also
forms a plexus, but it is subcutaneous and principally below the
inferior border of the external sphincter.There are, however, a number of communicating branches passing along
the walls of the rectum from one plexus to the other.The internal
hemorrhoidal veins also communicate freely with the branches of the
internal iliac around the trigone of the urinary bladder by means of
small vessels, which pass through the prostate gland and seminal
vesicles.By this method of anastomosis some relief is afforded when
there is an obstruction in the portal circulation, which is such a
common cause of turgescence of these veins, often resulting in
permanent dilatation or hemorrhoids.At the lower part, or at the junction of the middle and lower third of
the rectum, the internal circular fibres of the muscular coat of the
intestine become quite numerous, forming what is called the internal
sphincter muscle; it is nearly an inch in breadth, and completely
surrounds the lowest part of the rectum.It is about an inch above the
margin of the anus; its muscular fibres are of the involuntary or
unstriped variety; in function it assists the external sphincter in
closing the anus and preventing the involuntary escape of the contents
of the bowel.The external sphincter lies directly under the skin and upon the
internal sphincter and the levator ani muscle; its fibres encircle the
anus: arising from the coccyx, they are inserted into the tendinous
centre of the perineum, joining the transversus perinaei, the levator
ani, and accelerator urinae muscles.The sphincter ani is constantly in
a state of tonic contraction, but the force of its contraction may be
voluntarily increased.In the skin and superficial fascia are found
minute branches of the pudic and small sciatic nerves; in the
ischio-rectal space the internal pudic nerve; crossing about the centre
are the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves, which are distributed to the anus
and the lower portion of the rectum; the perineal nerve is especially
distributed to the anterior part of the anus.Thus it is seen that the rectum and anus have vascular and nervous
supplies of considerable diversity and importance.The simplest form of congenital malformation in this region consists in
an anus of insufficient size for the natural demands of the system, but
in no other manner abnormal.The most frequent variety of imperforate
anus is where complete occlusion is effected by the common integument
or by two cutaneo-mucous flaps, which owing to defective development
remain united without forming a raphe or perceptible line of union.The
rectum is not involved, and when the child strains the contained
meconium causes bulging of the part, which disappears under slight
pressure, but reappears when again free.In other cases the occluding
tissue is very firm, dense, with a disposition to pucker or form rugae.The sphincter muscle is rarely perfect, and though an artificial anus
may be made, years may elapse before the child can control the
evacuation.In conjunction with an imperforate anus the colon may
terminate in a cul-de-sac, or it may communicate with the urethra, the
bladder, or the vagina.{880} An imperforate rectum has been known to discharge at the
umbilicus, upon the face, under the scapula, upon the penis or the
anterior part of the scrotum.Sometimes, though very rarely, a common
cloaca has been found, as in fowls, common to the rectum and to the
genito-urinary organs; and still more rarely the rectum has opened in
abnormal sites upon the perineum and upon the buttocks.The rectum may be entirely absent or
it may be incomplete, terminating at various distances from the anus.These malformations of the bowel may be associated with a perfect anus,
or with any of its imperforate forms, or with a fecal fistula.In
occlusion of the rectum the offending structure is in some cases a
hymen-like fold of mucous membrane, which, during straining, can be
recognized by the finger as a fluctuating protrusion; while in others
it consists of a mass of dense fibrous tissue which extends upward from
an inch to an inch and a half: in the former there is always found a
normal anus; in the latter there is either no trace of anus or one in a
more or less rudimentary state.In those cases where the rectum is
entirely absent the intestine terminates either in a cul-de-sac or a
fecal fistula; very rarely the rectum is replaced by a
fibro-ligamentous cord or band which springs from the colon, and,
descending toward the bladder, blends with the connective tissue of the
part.In the latter the pelvis is always in an imperfect state of
development, being much contracted in its lower diameters, and the anus
is absent; and Rokitansky and Curling lay stress upon the
non-development of the pelvis as a diagnostic guide in determining the
absence of the rectum.The passage of a sound into the bladder or
vagina is a procedure of some diagnostic value, as if its point
impinges directly against the sacrum it may be presumed that no rectum
exists.If the malformation is of such a character that the fecal
matter can find no exit, a train of symptoms ensues analogous to those
seen in the adult affected with intestinal obstruction: the infant
cries and is constantly restless, refuses food, vomits, the abdomen
distends, and death speedily ensues.A remarkable exception to this
rule was the case mentioned by Bodenhamer of a child with absence of
the rectum who was not operated on until three months after birth, and
who was apparently in perfect health.At the operation the intestine
was found three inches from the surface, and the child made a good
recovery.Although the statistics of this class of malformations are somewhat
contradictory and confusing, it is safe to state that more male than
female children are so afflicted.The prognosis in the large majority of these cases is grave, for unless
the operator can see or feel the fluctuating protrusion, or can
recognize it after a very slight exploratory incision, he is working
totally in the dark and in close proximity to the peritoneum.Hemorrhage, peritonitis, pelvic cellulitis, and septicaemia diminish
the chances for recovery.Indeed, the majority of these cases are
scarcely amenable to surgical treatment.{881} PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS.Prolapse and Procidentia of Rectum and Anus.These conditions obtain most frequently at the two extremes of life,
infancy and senility, but have a very different causation in each.Prolapse of the bowel may be partial or complete--partial when a
portion of the mucous membrane is extruded, and complete when the
entire rectum appears outside the anal orifice.A predisposing cause in
infants is found in the mobility of the bowel--in the fact that it and
the sacrum are much less curved than in the adult, and the abdominal
viscera are more voluminous: this, associated with the undeveloped
state of the muscular system, causes the weight and strain to act
directly and forcibly upon the sphincters, and the extrusion takes
place.It is often excited by allowing children to sit for a length of
time upon the chamber-vessel.It is frequently caused among children by
the presence of vesical calculi, by Oxyuris vermicularis, diarrhoea,
constipation, dysentery, polypi, and by the long-continued acts of
coughing and crying.In adults and the aged it may be caused by loss of tone of the anus and
rectum in chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, or from the energetic action
of drastic cathartics, by urinary calculi, the long-continued use of
enemata, chronic cough, diarrhoea alternating with constipation,
stricture of the urethra, prostatic hypertrophy, tenesmus due to the
presence of polypi, and by the pressure of a pelvic tumor.It may
accompany procidentia uteri and hemorrhoids.An incomplete, reducible
prolapse consists of two or more overlapping plications of
normal-looking mucous membrane, sensitive but painless.In these cases
there is provoked a hyperplasia of much-elongated connective tissue in
the submucous space which undergoes serous infiltration and causes an
oedematous condition of the part.In a complete prolapse the entire
rectum--all of its component layers--is protruded through the anus.In
a recent case the folds of the gut are well marked, but in one where
the bowel has remained in this abnormal condition for some time the
submucous tissue becomes charged with inflammatory deposit which
effaces the plications and causes the bowel to become pale, hard, dry,
and tough; and finally pigmentation occurs and the part assumes
somewhat the character of true skin.These vary greatly in size, from
the slightest protrusion of mucous membrane to a tumor the size of a
melon.Usually they are reduced with ease, but their reappearance is
occasioned by the slightest tenesmus.In old age the soft parts of the floor of the pelvis and the anal
sphincters lose to a great extent their tone and contractile vigor, and
the rectum, also participating in this change, is often unable to
withstand the increased thrust of the diaphragm and the compression of
the abdominal muscles during defecation; which act frequently demands
more exertion on account of a tendency to constipation in advanced
life.In these long-standing cases of senile procidentia it is a matter of
experience, verified by post-mortem dissection, that the fibres of the
sphincters and of the levatores ani muscles are flattened, pale, and
stretched beyond the possibility of contraction, while the entire
perineum is in a state of atrophy.{882} Polypi of the Rectum.There are two varieties of these--the gelatinoid or soft, and the
fibroid or firm.The latter is of rare, the former of common,
occurrence, especially in children under the age of twelve years.The
fibroid polypus is only found in adults, and is composed of dense
connective-tissue elements and blood-vessels.The gelatinoid or soft
polypi are also partly composed of connective tissue and vessels, but
much finer than in the other: they contain hypertrophied follicles and
are covered with spherical epithelium.They resemble nasal polypi, but
are more dense.These growths are not malignant in character, but are
very troublesome, as they are almost always pedunculated, the stem
being from half an inch to four inches in length, which admits of the
descent of the tumor within the grasp of the sphincters during
defecation, and frequently admits of its escape from the anus.Their
presence is not free from danger, as they are very vascular, bleed
readily, and are sometimes detached by the breaking of the pedicle
during defecation.The presence of
these abnormal growths teases the rectum and brings on tenesmus and
frequent desire to go to stool; the feces are flattened, and with them
escapes a quantity of glairy red mucus which has been compared to thin
currant-jelly.When caught in the grasp of the sphincters they often
bleed profusely, and especially is this the case with children so
affected.The presence of these bodies is accompanied with a sense of
weight and uneasiness in the bowel.They may be single or multiple;
they may be round, reniform, oval, fusiform, or irregular; they may be
smooth or villous.In size they vary from that of a marble or cherry to
that of a small hen's egg, and they are usually found about three
inches above the anus, but they vary in position from a point just
within the sphincter to one six inches up the rectum.Their presence is
usually diagnosticated without difficulty, or, if any is experienced, a
digital exploration will reveal them.A child with functional
disturbances of the bowels accompanied with frequent hemorrhages should
be examined for polypus.One of these growths sometimes unpleasantly
complicates a case of hemorrhoids.A rectal polypus is an adenoma, consisting of dilated glands of
Lieberkuhn imbedded in connective tissue, also containing nerves and
blood-vessels, and is covered with the epithelium of the bowel.Hemorrhoids, or Piles.These are usually fibrous when situated below, or vascular when
situated above, the sphincter ani muscle.They are conveniently known
as external and internal piles, but in some instances it is impossible
to say whether these tumors are external or internal.In either variety
they are due to an abnormal state of the blood-vessels, and especially
of the plexus of superior, middle, and inferior hemorrhoidal veins
disposed around the lower extremity of the rectum immediately above the
internal sphincter muscle.The inferior mesenteric and internal iliac
veins receive a large portion of the blood from this plexus, so that a
very free intercommunication exists, around the lower portion of the
rectum, between the general {883} venous system and that of the liver.It should be borne in mind that these veins are destitute of valves,
and are situated in a very dependent part, which is normally in a high
degree of functional activity.External hemorrhoids are found at the very verge of the anus, and, when
not irritated or inflamed, appear like movable, dependent plications of
hypertrophied skin.They appear either singly or in groups, but it is
nothing unusual to find five or six of them together, and they are not
infrequently associated with the internal variety.These pendulous tabs
of integument are very prone to inflammation, and they then become
exquisitely tender, painful tumors, which vary in size from that of a
small pea to that of a pigeon's egg.That portion of the tumor
presenting toward the anus is covered with mucous membrane; the other
is covered with integument; the former is dark-, due to
engorgement of its vessels.These, being composed internally of
tortuous, dilated veins which have totally lost their normal
resiliency, bleed freely on section, but after a time they undergo the
following changes: the over-distended vein, of which each is mainly
composed, either becomes obliterated by the encroachment of
inflammatory deposit or its walls give way and the contained blood
escapes; its serum is absorbed, and the tumor now consists of a
blood-clot, the remains of a vessel, inflammatory lymph, a hyperplasia
of connective tissue, mucous membrane, and integument.It undergoes a
still further change by absorption, and remains a permanent pendulous
teat of cutaneous and connective tissue, bearing no trace of vascular
channels.On account of the extremely sensitive nature of the mucous membrane and
skin of the anus, an inflamed condition of these tumors entails an
amount of suffering very disproportionate to their size: there is
torture in the act of defecation, constant tenesmus, spasm of the
sphincters, a sense of weight and heat in the perineum, and sometimes a
swollen, very painful, condition of the raphe, which stands out like a
cord.Occasionally there is a total inability to urinate, combined with a
frequent desire to do so.When an attack such as this ends in
suppuration of the tumor a radical cure is effected, but a marginal
ulcer of the anus sometimes follows.An unclean and neglectful habit
provoking constipation, sexual incontinence, over-indulgence in
highly-seasoned food or in stimulating beverages, exposure to cold and
wet, and the straining attendant upon dysuria, will provoke an attack.No age or sex is exempt from this affection (Gross).It is claimed that
before puberty females are more subject to it than males; after that
age the reverse obtains, except during pregnancy.Internal hemorrhoids are round, oval, or sometimes cylindroid-shaped
tumors covered by mucous membrane; they are smooth, granular, or rough
to the touch, much less sensitive and painful than the inflamed
external variety, and are situated within the rectum it may be an inch
or two above the internal sphincter muscle.They occur in groups or
scattered over the surface of the bowel.In structure they are soft,
spongy, vascular tumors composed of dilated and tortuous blood-vessels,
the veins predominating over the arteries, their interstices scantily
supplied with connective tissue, and their covering is of mucous
membrane.In color they are dark red, but when compressed and
strangulated by the sphincters they assume a dusky purple hue.After
long exposure they take on a pseudo-cutaneous appearance.{884} The columns of the rectum are the seat of the cylindroid pile,
which is brighter in color and much more arterial in its structure than
the ordinary variety, and bleeds very freely.Anything which causes
stasis and accumulation of blood in the hemorrhoidal plexus of veins
predisposes to this very common affection.Constipation is the usual
cause; and among others may be named diseases of the liver which cause
portal obstruction, pelvic tumors causing engorgement from pressure,
the gravid uterus, labor, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary calculi,
stricture of the urethra, stricture of the rectum, and rectal tumors.Among other causes are horseback-riding, the erect posture, violent
cathartics, seat-worms, dysentery, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and a
sedentary life, with a diet of rich, stimulating food.These piles do not usually cause much suffering; they vary in size from
that of a pea to that of a pigeon's egg, and cause a sense of weight
and stuffing in the bowel; but when they are large and numerous they
cause severe pain, tenesmus, difficult defecation, spasm of the
sphincters, and prolapse of the anus.When the patient is at stool the
tumors are forced down and protrude in a bunch, surrounded and
constricted by a collar of prolapsed mucous membrane: under these
circumstances the tortuous and dilated vessels of which they are
composed give way and free arterio-venous hemorrhage takes place.In
some cases this happens at every stool, the patient losing from a few
ounces to a half pint of blood almost daily until alarmingly depleted.Usually, the protruded piles are easily restored after a motion of the
bowels, and so remain until the next one occurs; but in other cases of
longer standing and of more gravity the sphincter loses all tone and
the piles remain constantly prolapsed.This affection is very chronic,
and the subject of it has to regulate his life with the greatest care,
as the least unusual effort or excess may provoke an exacerbation.Excepting in the worst cases the general health is not materially
impaired.They occasionally become so strangulated as to slough off,
which effects a cure, but this is accompanied by grave constitutional
disturbance.The disease is rather rare before the age of puberty, but
is very common in both sexes in adult life, and is frequently
associated with fistula, polypus, fissure, or carcinoma of this region.In females suffering with piles a free hemorrhage from them sometimes
takes the place of the menstrual flow.The presence of internal piles
causes a sense of weight and fulness and the sensation of a foreign
body or of feces remaining in the rectum, with troublesome and
obstinate itching about the anus.These symptoms, with the occurrence
of hemorrhage from the rupture, erosion, ulceration, or abrasion of the
dilated vessels, render the diagnosis easy.Should the piles not
protrude, they can readily be made to do so by directing the patient to
sit and strain over a vessel containing hot water.If the piles do not
appear, a digital examination should be made.Indeed, it would be
better to make one in every case of this kind.About the margin of the anus the superficial veins are prone to great
dilatation, and when presenting form masses of a bluish color, often
very dark, covered partly by mucous membrane, partly by integument.{885} Dilatation of the Rectal Pouches, or Physick's Encysted Rectum.This is an uncommon disease, generally occurring in those advanced in
years, and consists of an hypertrophy, and sometimes of an
inflammation, of the natural rectal sacs.These pouches are quite small
in early life, and enlarge gradually as age advances, this condition
being favored by the lodgment in them of extraneous substances, such as
indurated fecal matter, inspissated mucus, the seeds of fruit, and
other undigested masses.Constipation, so usual with the old,
predisposes to this affection, as it keeps the bowel distended with
hardened feces.The pouches vary much in size, the largest of them
admitting the end of a finger.The disease is insidious and slow, but
is capable of producing intense suffering should inflammation,
suppuration, or ulceration attack them.Sometimes as many as a dozen
are involved.The symptoms, which are rather misleading than suggestive of the
disorder, are a sensation of weight and uneasiness just within the anus
and uneasy sensations in the rectum, distressing itching, and, after a
time, pain following defecation and lasting often for hours.The pain,
which is aching and burning in character, is not confined to the parts
affected, but radiates down the thighs, toward the back, and into the
perineum.An increased secretion of mucus always exists in these cases,
but the discharge of purulent matter is uncommon, and its presence
indicates the existence of very active inflammation.It is said that even in the worst cases no spasm of the sphincters
occurs.An exploration of the bowel with a blunt-pointed hook affords
the only reliable guide to correct diagnosis: this, as it is moved
about in the rectum, engages the rim of a sac, which may thus be drawn
down through the anus and examined.Non-malignant Stricture of the Rectum.In the absence of ulceration or syphilitic infection this is an
uncommon disease, and very many of the cases of so-called stricture of
the rectum are caused by spasm which always disappears during
anaesthesia.The affection may be described as a narrowing of the lumen of the
rectum, more or less circumscribed, by the deposition of inflammatory
lymph or fibrous tissue in the mucous, submucous, or muscular tunic of
the bowel.It may be due to traumatic causes, such as the introduction
of foreign bodies, the frequent and careless use of enema-pipes, or the
presence of sharp or irritating substances swallowed, as pieces of
shell or bone.It is said to have been caused by indurated feces, but
no cases have been published in which this causation is clearly shown.This condition has also been brought about by various operations upon
the mucous coat of the bowel, such as the application of nitric acid
and other escharotics and the removal of portions of mucous membrane
and of hemorrhoids.Stricture may be secondary and a result of extension of an inflammation
outside the bowel, as pelvic cellulitis; and it is frequently caused by
syphilitic deposition and by chancroidal invasion--in the former by
{886} infiltration, ulceration, and cicatrization, in the latter by
unnatural sexual connection, or by infecting vaginal discharge running
into the bowel.When the stricture involves only the mucous tunic, it imparts to the
finger the sensation of a ring-like elevation or a valve-like
projection, into which the finger enters or beyond which it passes
usually without much difficulty; but when it involves the submucous and
muscular layers, as after the cicatrization of a large rectal ulcer,
the finger encounters a dense fibrous mass which in some cases appears
to have no lumen, but in others will admit only the end of the finger.In these grave cases of long standing there occurs considerable
dilatation of the rectum above the stricture due to fecal detention and
impaction at this point, and hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the
bowel produced by long-continued straining and expulsive efforts.Allingham[2] speaks of chronic constipation as a cause, and says,
"Straining to evacuate the contents of the bowel forces down the upper
part of the rectum into the lower, causing an intussusception; it gets
within the grasp of the sphincter muscles, and this may be the
starting-point of the irritation."Stricture does not usually follow
proctitis, even when the latter is very chronic.The long-continued
pressure of the child's head in cases of delayed labor is said to have
caused stricture of the rectum.[Footnote 2: _Diseases of the Rectum_, p.This affection is a disease of adult life, and more cases of it occur
among women than among men."If stricture of the rectum is found in a
young woman, it is probably due to chancre cicatrices; if it is met
with in old women and men, the inference should be that it is either
caused by cancer or by syphilitic infiltration and its consequences.Only in those cases in which no cicatricial tissue has been
formed--that is, when the contraction is due to the infiltration
alone--will the results of the antisyphilitic treatment contribute
anything toward rendering the diagnosis more certain."Stricture of the bowel may exist for months and years without being
recognized and without causing the patient much uneasiness; more
frequently, however, there is marked uneasiness, with an increased
desire to go to stool and a sense of weight or of a foreign body in the
bowel.It is given usually as
one of the most common and reliable symptoms of this condition that the
feces are flattened, ribbon-shaped, or triangular or wire-drawn: in
true stricture, according to Allingham, this is not the case, but the
characteristic stool consists of small, irregular, broken fecal
fragments.When the contents of the bowel happen to be watery, the
loose stool is spurted out with great force.In this disease diarrhoea
alternates with constipation; the intestines become distended with
quantities of gas and feces, which provoke frequent and severe attacks
of colic; the appetite and digestion fail; the complexion becomes
sallow; the patient emaciates; ulceration sets in, and the patient
slowly sinks from exhaustion.Usually, these cases do not give rise to
much pain, and what there is, is usually referred to the back, thighs,
penis, or perineum.A discharge of mucus resembling white of egg
immediately precedes each action of the bowels.Usually, these
strictures are within two and a half or three inches of the anus, but
sometimes they have been found high up in the sigmoid flexure, and
rarely at a greater distance.A syphilitic stricture by direct
inoculation {887} is found just within the sphincter muscle, and
consists of an infiltration of inflammatory lymph in a circumscribed
portion of the submucous tissue.It is tight, highly sensitive,
thickened, inflamed, and bathed in pus; there are also constitutional
symptoms, as fever, anorexia, and mental irritability.The subjects of
this variety are usually women.The tissues composing strictures of the
rectum of a very chronic character are found to be gray or bluish-white
in color, of very dense fibrous structure, and creaking under the knife
when cut, as a piece of cork would do.Besides the before-mentioned stricture, due to the contraction of a
chancroidal ulcer, is another caused by submucous gummata of the
ano-rectal region, which is very rare; and yet another, the diffuse
gumma, or ano-syphiloma of Fournier, which is the most frequent of all
causes of stricture of the rectum.The diffuse gumma is one of the
later manifestations of syphilis, and consists in "an infiltration of
the ano-rectal walls by a neoplasm of as yet undetermined structure
originally, but susceptible of degenerating into a retractile fibrous
tissue, and thus giving rise to narrowing of the intestinal calibre to
a greater or less extent."Proctitis, or Inflammation of the Rectum.Inflammation and suppuration in the lower part of the rectum are even
more common than the corresponding affections of the caecum, and their
causes are quite as various.In many cases, no doubt, this affection is
traceable to ulceration (perforative or otherwise) of the mucous
membrane; in others it probably originates in the connective tissue
which surrounds the rectum (periproctitis).The rectum, still more
frequently than the caecum, becomes involved in inflammation and
suppuration originating in the various pelvic, and even in distant,
organs.Abscesses arising in the abdominal cavity or its parietes are
peculiarly apt to gravitate into the pelvis and to communicate with the
rectum.Proctitis in its acute form has some symptoms in common with dysentery,
but it differs from it by the absence of abdominal pain, tenderness,
and severe constitutional symptoms.The pain in proctitis is usually
referred to the sacrum and perineum, and there is frequently dysuria
from sympathetic affection of the bladder.This disease may be acute or
chronic; the latter form occurs in those advanced in life.Frequent
attempts to evacuate the bowels, with great tenesmus, heat, weight, and
fulness in the bowel, and a mucous and bloody discharge in the absence
of impaction of the rectum, characterize the attack.Should it be
protracted and severe, the discharge will become purulent.A digital
exploration should always be made to ascertain if any foreign or
irritating substance is exciting the inflammation.The presence in large numbers of Oxyuris vermicularis may excite
irritation and inflammation of the rectal mucous membrane, which is
sometimes very intense.[3]

[Footnote 3: Curschmann, _Ziem.Inflammation of the anus and buttocks, caused by the application of the
leaves of Rhus toxicodendron after defecation, has extended into the
{888} rectum and produced proctitis and peritonitis.[4] "In some cases
of dysentery the pathological lesions are limited to the rectum, which
would produce an apparently local inflammation very similar to
proctitis.The irritation of unnatural sexual intercourse and the
contact of gonorrhoeal poison have been known to excite intense
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the rectum, with a copious
discharge of pure pus, and accompanied by intense burning pain and
great heat of the parts involved."[5]

[Footnote 4: Case of Dunmire, _Philada.[Footnote 5: Heubner, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.Fissure of the Anus and Rectum.The painful ulcer of Allingham is quite a common affection, attacking
women more frequently than men, and no age is exempt from it.Of 4000
consecutive cases of rectal and anal disease observed by Allingham, 446
presented fissure of the rectum.Their usual
position is dorsal, although they may be found at any part of the
circumference of the anus, and just within the verge of the anus at the
junction of the skin and mucous membrane, extending upward toward the
rectum usually not more than half an inch, and appearing as a crack or
fissure, often very trifling in appearance, or a club-shaped
ulceration, the floor of which will be very red and inflamed if it is
recent, but if chronic the floor will be grayish, with hard,
well-defined margins.Sometimes there will be found at the external
extremity of the fissure a small club-shaped papilla or muco-cutaneous
polypoid growth; but this is not to be confounded with the ordinary
polypus, nor is it the cause of the fissure, but the result of
irritation caused by the latter.In other cases the external site of
the fissure is indicated by a very tender and swollen flap of
integument, which often becomes the seat of a small but very painful
fistula.The club-shaped papilla is said to indicate invariably the
existence of fissure.Fissure of the rectum is often associated with anteversion and
retroflexion of the womb.In many of these cases the fissure will heal
spontaneously when the malposition is rectified.However treated, the
result will not be satisfactory while the uterine trouble remains
uncorrected.Fissure is not infrequently caused by and accompanied with polypi: it
may be caused by any accident whereby the verge of the anus is torn or
superficially lacerated--by chronic diarrhoea, by violent expulsive,
straining efforts, as in labor, by the passage of very hard, dry
stools--and very frequently it is syphilitic in origin.The most
prominent symptom of this disease is pain, and this is very severe and
peculiar in character, coming on in most cases not during the act of
defecation, but twenty minutes to half an hour afterward, and is
preceded by a hot, burning, throbbing sensation at the anus: then comes
on spasmodic contraction of the sphincters, and the patient endures
agonizing pain, often for several hours, when relief is gradually
experienced, and no pain is felt until defecation again becomes
necessary.Now, it has been observed that in some cases where the local
lesion is very trifling the pain and spasm are intense and
long-continued; in other cases, where spasm and agonizing {889} pain
followed every act of defecation, no lesion of the anus or rectum could
be found.This led Dolbeau to consider the essence of fissure of the
anus neuralgic, and to define it as "a spasmodic neuralgia of the anus
with or without fissure."The mental depression is so much out of
proportion to the local disease that this may come within Curling's
observation, that "mental causes may produce local disease in the
rectum."Rodent, or Lupoid, Ulcer of the Rectum.This is, fortunately, a rare disease, and is peculiar and distinct from
any other form of ulceration in this region.It is not cancerous,
although bearing some resemblance to epithelioma.As it first appears
it is very like a syphilitic sore, and its situation and the character
of the pain might lead to the
