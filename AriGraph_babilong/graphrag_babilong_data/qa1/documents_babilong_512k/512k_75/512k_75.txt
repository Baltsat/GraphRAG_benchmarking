  By a singular coincidence, China has been suffering from a Hyksos
  domination of Tartar conquerors, precisely as Egypt did after the
  period of the Pyramid builders, and, strange to say, for about the

  should have witnessed in China the exact counterpart of what took
  place in Egypt when the 1st native kings of the 18th dynasty expelled
  the hated race.H. Vyse, ‘Operations carried on the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837.’

  This will be best understood by looking at the section (Woodcut 7), in
  which it will be seen that the so-called coping or casing-stones were
  not simply triangular blocks, filling up the angles formed by the
  receding steps, and which might have been easily displaced, but stones
  from 7 to 10 feet in depth, which could not have been supported unless
  the work had been commenced at the bottom.On the other hand, it is
  difficult to understand how the casing-stones for the upper portion
  could have been raised up the sloping portion completed.It is
  probable, therefore, that the casing was commenced at the angles and
  was carried up in vertical planes, thus leaving a causeway of steps in
  the middle of each face, which diminished in width as the work
  proceeded; this causeway, a few feet wide only, on each face being
  then encased from the top downwards after the apex blocks had been
  laid.—ED.Footnote 31:

  I have ventured to restore the roof of the cella with a sikra (ziggur
  or ziggurah, according to Rawlinson’s ‘Five Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.395, et passim), from finding similar roofs at Susa, Bagdad,
  Keffeli, &c. They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some
  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it
  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which
  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic
  architecture.Footnote 73:

  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,
  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess
  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the
  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a
  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which
  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,
  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200
  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20
  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,
  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole
  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.
  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives
  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the
  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more
  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously
  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general
  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:

  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all
  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information
  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The
  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference
  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since
  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings
  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom
  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than
  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,
  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the
  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire
  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded
  to.Footnote 78:

  Published in 1862, in the ‘Athenæum’ journal, No.Footnote 79:

  This plan, with all the particulars here mentioned, are taken from
  Layard’s work, which is the only authority on the subject, so that it
  is not necessary to refer to him on every point.The plan is reduced
  to the usual scale of 100 ft.to 1 inch, for easy comparison with the
  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:

  The whole of the information regarding Khorsabad is taken from M.
  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et
  l’Assyrie,’ by M. Victor Place.Footnote 81:

  These particulars are all borrowed from M. Place’s great work, ‘Ninive
  et l’Assyrie,’ folio.Footnote 82:

  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this
  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the
  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis
  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the
  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published
  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on
  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent
  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general
  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over
  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never
  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been
  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such
  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and
  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time
  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were
  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of
  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because
  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such
  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the
  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so
  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them
  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in
  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were
  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of
  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two
  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.According to M. Place they formed
  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would
  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry
  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the
  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The
  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high
  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the
  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls
  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:

  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,
  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand
  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their
  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side
  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had
  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:

  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or
  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase
  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained
  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor
  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just
  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was
  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:

  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having
  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a
  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:

  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the
  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before
  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:

  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:

  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;
  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:

  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric
  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:

  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note
  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by
  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s
  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to
  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians
  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,
  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the
  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,
  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:

  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from
  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is
  mentioned.Footnote 93:

  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and
  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its
  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:

  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is
  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,
  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to
  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily
  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller
  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:

  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square
  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at
  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations
  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the
  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features
  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear
  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the
  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by
  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld
  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain
  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the
  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which
  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the
  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the
  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the
  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have
  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its
  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the
  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:

  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,
  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add
  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion
  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of
  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left
  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the
  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and
  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:

  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;
  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,
  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:

  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which
  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four
  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,
  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed
  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or
  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the
  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the
  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit
  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:

  from recent explorations and recently discovered analogies have, I
  believe, been able to settle, within very narrow limits of doubt, all
  the outstanding questions with reference to this celebrated building.I have in consequence written and published a monograph of the Temple,
  but have deemed it more expedient to leave the illustrations here as

  “Toward the centre of the monument two large stones were found leaning
  at an angle the one against the other, and forming a sort of tent,
  like in Woodcut 124, under which was presently discovered a small
  statue of Minerva seated on a chariot with four horses, and an urn of
  metal filled with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones.This urn, which is
  now in the possession of the Comte de Choiseul, is enriched in
  sculpture with a vine branch, from which is suspended bunches of
  grapes done with exquisite art.”—‘Description of the Plain of Troy,’
  translated by Dalzel, Edin.If this is so, this is no doubt the vessel mentioned, ‘Iliad,’ xvi.92; ‘Od.,’ xxiv.and why has not the fact of its existence been more insisted upon?Footnote 118:

  One of the most interesting facts brought to light in Dr.Schliemann’s
  excavations is that between the age of the “Ilium Vetus” of Homer,
  rich in metals and in arts, and the “Ilium Novum” of Strabo, a people
  ignorant of use of the metals, and using only bone and stone
  implements, inhabited the mound at Hissarlik which covered both these
  cities.This discovery is sufficient to upset the once fashionable
  Danish theory of the three ages—Stone, Bronze, and Iron—but,
  unfortunately, adds nothing to our knowledge of architecture.These
  people, whoever they were, built nothing, and must consequently be
  content to remain in the “longa nocte” of those who neglect the Master
  Art.Footnote 119:

  This tomb is considered by M. Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)
  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:
  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their
  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all
  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with
  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked
  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it
  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”
  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,
  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large
  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:

  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut
  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be
  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:

  near Malta, and generally wherever chambered tumuli are found.Footnote 128:

  A cast of these is to be found in the South Kensington Museum.Footnote 129:

  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to
  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the
  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick
  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls
  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no
  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative
  features, of which so many others are found in the style.Footnote 130:

  Pausanias, vi.Footnote 131:

  The dimensions are 94 feet by 45, covering consequently only 4230
  feet.Footnote 132:

  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the
  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks
  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration
  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,
  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was
  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring
  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:

  M. J. Thacher Clarke, who directed the American expedition in 1881, is
  now occupied with a monograph on the subject, and a report by him was
  published in 1882.Footnote 134:

  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of
  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described
  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another
  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,
  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is
  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of
  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the
  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:

  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:

  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than
  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this
  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden
  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and
  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the
  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson
  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further
  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries
  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;
  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera
  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The
  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in
  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at
  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,
  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to
  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up
  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the
  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the
  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the
  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,
  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of
  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes
  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric
  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:

  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his
  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the
  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti
  Society.Footnote 139:

  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian
  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and
  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly
  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of
  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:

  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some
  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural
  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and
  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other
  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed
  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at
  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:

  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:

  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an
  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles
  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was
  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in
  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his
  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter
  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the
  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his
  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on
  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another
  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to
  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof
  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned
  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by
  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the
  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple
  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the

  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,
  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole
  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his
  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,
  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,
  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open
  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the
  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,
  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the
  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light
  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting
  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have
  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the
  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems
  simply impossible.Footnote 149:

  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a
  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the
  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to
  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:

  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls
  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have
  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various
  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were
  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of
  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best
  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors
  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek
  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a
  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing
  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:

  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this
  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on
  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also

  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with
  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns
  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite

  These two temples, like almost all the others of Rome, have recently
  been renamed by the Roman or rather German antiquaries.The Jupiter
  Tonans is now the Temple of Saturn, and the Jupiter Stator is decreed
  to have been the Temple of Castor and Pollux.The names by which they
  are currently known has been adhered to, as the architecture is of
  more importance here than the archæology.Footnote 167:

  When the first edition of this work was written I believed the rotunda
  to have been added to the portico by Severus; and if this were so it
  would get over many of the difficulties arising from its size and the
  character of its brickwork.My personal examination, however, has
  forced me very unwillingly to give up this hypothesis.It certainly
  is, however, very astonishing that such a vault should have been
  attempted at so early an age.[There seems to be some probability that Mr.Fergusson’s first belief
  was correct, and that the Rotunda was built by Hadrian, bricks with
  the stamp of his period having been found in the casing and in the
  bond courses in the solid concrete both of the drum and in the dome.The discovery is due to M. Chedanne, one of the “Grand Prix” students
  in the Villa Medici, who had selected the subject for his “Envoi de
  Rome,” and was allowed to superintend certain repairs and restorations
  which were required in the Pantheon.It would seem that the portico
  erected by Agrippa preceded a temple with cella of the ordinary form,
  the pavement of which has been found nearly seven feet below the floor
  of the present church.From this it follows that when the Rotunda was
  erected in the first half of the second century, the portico, which is
  undoubtedly of Agrippa’s time, must have been taken down and rebuilt
  on to it, and this explains Mr.Fergusson’s reasons for insisting that
  the portico was built on to the Rotunda.The theory as to the Pantheon
  forming part of Agrippa’s bath is thus disposed of.Independently of
  that, however, Prof.Middleton has pointed out that the discoveries
  made in 1882, by the removal of the block of houses at the back,
  showed that there was no connection whatever between the two
  buildings.Traces exist of the original marble lining, and of cornices
  which were continued round the dome, showing that originally the
  complete circuit was exposed to view.Middleton
  states, “if further proof were wanting to contradict the theory that
  the Pantheon was over the Calidarum or Laconicum of the bath, this is
  supplied by the fact that there is no trace of any hypocaust under the
  floor, but merely an ancient drain to carry away the rain-water that
  fell through the opening in the dome.The Pantheon, too, is on the
  north side of the Thermæ—a very improbable position for the Laconicum,
  or hot room, which was usually placed on the sunny side of the
  buildings.”—ED.]Footnote 170:

  The bronze plates which were removed by Pope Urban VIII.in 1626 to
  make cannon, and also for the great Baldachino in St.Peter’s, were
  taken from the portico; the coffers of the interior of the dome were
  decorated, according to Prof.Middleton, with mouldings in stucco
  painted and gilt.Footnote 171:

  This building is commonly called a temple, though it is not known to
  what deity it was dedicated.My own impression is that it was a tomb,
  or at least a funereal monument of some sort.Footnote 172:

  Owing to a misreading of Vitruvius’s statement respecting the temple
  it had always been classed as decastyle.Penrose’s researches
  published in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Institute of British
  Architects,’ vol.Footnote 173:

  See ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ where the reasons for this
  arrangement will be found stated at length.[See note on page
  272.—ED.]Footnote 174:

  Canina, in his restoration, shows a flat roof with coffers, so there
  is probably no exact authority for its form, though it seems to be
  generally agreed that the centre was not hypæthral.Footnote 175:

  This basilica is generally represented as having an apse at either
  end; but there is no authority whatever for this, and general analogy
  would lead us rather to infer that it was not the case.Middleton, however, is of opinion that an apse existed at both ends,
  and shows the same in his restoration of the plan of Trajan’s
  form.—‘The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ by J. H. Middleton, Fig.Footnote 176:

  One of the pillars of this basilica remained _in situ_ till the year
  1614, when it was removed by Carlo Maderno, by order of Paul V., and
  re-erected in the piazza of St.M. Maggiore, where it now stands as a
  monumental column, supporting a statue of the Virgin.The column, with
  its base and capital, is as nearly as may be 60 ft.in height; the
  whole monument, as it now stands, 140 ft.Footnote 177:

  As it was sunk slightly below the pavement of the peristyle, and
  drains leading from it were traced by Mr.Ashpitel, it was probably
  hypæthral.Footnote 178:

  The theatres of Curio and Scaurus were in timber, except the
  proscenium of the latter, which was partly decorated with marble and
  mosaics.The Theatre of Pompey, B.C.54, was in stone, and parts of it
  still exist (Prof.The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by
  Julius Cæsar, but not completed till 13 B.C., when it was opened by
  Augustus.It was subsequently restored after a fire by Vespasian, but
  the purity and simplicity of the architecture, and the refinement of
  the details, in comparison with those of the Colosseum, 70-80 A.D.,
  are in favour of the earlier date assigned to it.Middleton
  quotes another theatre, that of Cornelius Balbus (13 B.C.), built to
  the north-west of the Theatre of Marcellus.Middleton the Amphitheatre of Sutrium is of Roman
  origin, and but little earlier than the Colosseum at Rome.“There is
  really no evidence,” he says (p.76), “that amphitheatres were built
  by the Etruscans; and there can be little doubt that they were purely
  Roman inventions.”

Footnote 180:

  At the Crystal Palace it has always been found necessary to allow 6

  Considerable difference of opinion seems to exist as to the extent of
  the velaria which sheltered the arena; this was supported by masts
  fixed outside the upper part of the walls, resting on brackets, 14 ft.below the cornice, which was cut away to allow the mast to fit close
  against the wall.M. Gérôme suggests, in his well-known picture of the
  Roman gladiators, that the velaria extended over a portion of the
  arena only.Middleton states, “The awning did not, as has been
  sometimes supposed, cover the whole amphitheatre, a thing which would
  have been practically impossible, owing to the enormous strain of so
  long a bearing, far beyond what any ropes could bear.It simply sloped
  down over the spectators in the cavea, leaving the whole central arena
  uncovered.” In case of rain, however, this might have been
  inconvenient, and it would not have protected the spectators from the
  sun, supposing that the performances lasted the whole day.Besides,
  there is no reason why the masts should have been carried so high
  above the wall, as shown in the restoration in Prof.Middleton’s book,
  p.Alma Tadema is of opinion that the velarium extended over
  the whole arena, and was suspended on a principle similar to that of a
  suspension bridge, the ridge, or highest portion lying between the
  foci of the ellipse.This accounts in a much more satisfactory way for
  the height of the masts, and would afford facilities for the draining
  off of the rain on to the top of the gallery round.Footnote 182:

  These baths have been carefully measured by M. Blouet, who has also
  published a restoration of them.This is, on the whole, certainly the
  best account we have of any of these establishments.Middleton this magnificent hall appears to have
  been what Spartianus calls the _cella soliaris_, the ceiling of which
  he says was formed of interlaced bars of gilt bronze.When the
  excavations in this hall were being made, many tons of fragments of
  iron girders were found.Aitchison)
  compound girders, formed of two T bars riveted together, and then
  cased in bronze.A sort of lattice-work ceiling had been formed with
  these bronze-cased girders, the panels being probably filled in with
  concrete made of light pumice-stone, worked with fine stucco reliefs,
  painted and gilt.Middleton is of opinion that the central part
  over the swimming-bath was left open for the admission of light.In
  the upper part of the walls deep sinkings to receive the ends of the
  great girders which supported the ceiling are clearly visible.George’s Hall at Liverpool is the most exact copy in modern times
  of a part of these baths.The Hall itself is a reproduction both in
  scale and design of the central hall of Caracalla’s baths, but
  improved in detail and design, having five bays instead of only three.With the two courts at each end, it makes up a suite of apartments
  very similar to those found in the Roman examples.The whole building,
  however, is less than one-fourth of the size of the central mass of a
  Roman bath, and therefore gives but little idea of the magnificence of
  the whole.Footnote 187:

  The left-hand wing of this arch has since been restored by M.
  Viollet-le-Duc, and the right-hand wing cleared of the square building
  in front of it.Footnote 188:

  These two buildings are described further on (p.544) as Christian
  edifices.Footnote 189:

  Professor Middleton states: “This building appears to be a nymphæum,
  or a part of some baths of about the time of Gallienus (263-268
  A.D.).” It was known in the Middle Ages as the “Terme de Gallucio.”
  The site of the real Temple of Minerva Medica was discovered in 1887
  (according to the same authority) between the new Via Macchiavelli and
  the Via Buonarroti, about 7 ft.Footnote 191:

  M. de Saulcy has recently attempted to prove that these tombs are
  those of the kings of Judah from David downwards.Their architecture
  is undoubtedly as late as the Christian era, and the cover of the
  sarcophagus which is now in the Louvre under the title of that of
  David is probably of the same date as these tombs, or if anything more
  modern.Footnote 192:

  Though the dates of all these tombs at Cyrene are so uncertain, there
  seems little doubt that if any one thoroughly versed in the style were
  to visit the place, he could fix the age of all of them with
  approximate correctness.The one difficulty is, that a chronometric
  scale taken from the buildings at Rome, or even in Syria, will not
  suffice.Local peculiarities must be taken into account and allowed
  for, and this requires both time and judgment.Footnote 194:

  like it.All the others were erected as designed by the architects who
  built the churches, and none fit so well.Footnote 229:

  [This rule cannot be made a hard and fast one.Procopius states that
  in the central dome of the Church of the Apostles, Constantinople,
  “the circular building standing above the arches is pierced with
  windows, and the spherical dome which over-arches it seems to be
  suspended in the air.” In the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople
  the walls of the octagon, which are pierced with windows, are carried
  up to the vault, and in the church of Sta.Sophia at Thessalonica the
  windows are pierced in an upright dome cylindrical internally.In all
  these cases, however, there is a marked distinction between these
  examples and those of the lofty cylindrical drums which were employed
  in the Neo-Byzantine churches.Fergusson’s rule, therefore, with
  these exceptions, may be taken as absolute.—ED.]Footnote 234:

  Even if it should be asserted that this is no proof that the
  inhabitants of these countries were Buddhists in those days, it seems
  tolerably certain that they were tree-worshippers, which is very
  nearly the same thing.Procopius tells us that “even in his day these
  barbarians worshipped forests and groves, and in their barbarous
  simplicity placed the trees among their gods.” (‘De Bello Gotico,’

  [It has been assumed that the Roman basilicas were taken possession of
  by the early Christians for their own religious services, but as Mr.G. G. Scott points out in his ‘Essay on the History of English Church
  Architecture,’ “there is no well-authenticated instance of the
  conversion of any Pagan basilica into a Christian church, whilst there
  are abundant examples of Pagan temples converted into Christian
  sanctuaries” (see Texier and Pullan’s ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ pp.Scott observes, “on the face of it
  improbable, if we reflect that the conversion of the government to
  Christianity had no tendency to render the existing basilicas less
  necessary for legal business, after the peace of the church, than they
  had been before that event.Christianity, unfortunately, could not
  abolish the litigious instincts of our nature, and after fifteen
  centuries of the gospel the legal profession still flourishes.” The
  buildings which were rendered useless by the official recognition of
  the new faith were not the basilicas but the temples, the fact being
  that the class of building known as a basilica (a term never used by
  either the writers or architects of Byzantine times), with its wide
  central nave and aisles with galleries over them lighted by clerestory
  or side windows, and covered with a timber roof, constituted the
  simplest and most economical building of large size which could be
  constructed to hold a vast assembly of worshippers; especially as the
  only features which can be looked upon as having any architectural
  pretensions, viz., the columns and their capitals, could be taken
  wholesale from temples and other Roman buildings.The semicircular
  apse, which alone in the Roman basilica served as a court of law,
  became the tribune for the bishop and presbyters.Scott is even inclined to assign an earlier and more independent
  origin for the basilican form.According to his theory the germ of the
  Christian basilica was a simple oblong aisleless room divided by a
  cross arch, beyond which lay an altar detached from the wall.This
  germ was developed by the addition of side aisles, and sometimes an
  aisle returned across the entrance, and over these upper aisles were
  next constructed and transepts added, together with the oratories or
  chapels in various parts of the building.Butler, in his work on
  ‘The Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt,’ accepts this theory, as the
  churches of Egypt are rich in evidence that favours it.At the same
  time, the first great basilica erected by Constantine, viz., the
  Vatican (St.Peter’s), and the Lateran, (St.John Lateran), are of too
  great importance to warrant the suggestion that their origin should be
  sought for in the very small though possibly earlier examples in Egypt
  or the East.—ED.]Footnote 258:

  This probably refers to its foundation, for M. Cattaneo, in his work
  ‘L’architecture en Italie, 1890,’ judging by its ornamental detail,
  places the church in the second half of the seventh century.Footnote 259:

  ‘Antiquités,’ vol.Footnote 260:

  _Eodem_, vol.Alfred J. Butler’s work, already referred to, has thrown
  considerable light on the subject, though, as he was unable to visit
  any of the Coptic churches up the Nile, we are still left in doubt as
  to the age of the convent near Siout and other buildings.From
  comparison of the plans and descriptions given in Denon, Curzon and
  Pococke of these buildings, with those in Cairo and Old Cairo, Mr.Butler ascribes them to the fourth century, that which in fact is
  claimed for them as having been founded by Sta.On this
  subject he says, p.365: “Were there no more of evidence besides to
  determine the truth of this tradition, the plan of the Haikal (the
  central of the three chapels in a Coptic church) would decide it
  beyond question.The persistence with which certain churches are
  ascribed to Sta.Helena by a people utterly ignorant of history and
  architecture is in itself remarkable, and it is still more remarkable
  to find that these churches are always marked by a particular form of
  Haikal.Indeed, so regular is the coincidence, that a deep apsidal
  haikal with recesses all round it and columns close against the wall
  may be almost infallibly dated from the age of Sta.Helena.”

Footnote 262:

  The older church has been so altered and ruined by the subsequent
  rebuildings that it is extremely difficult to make out its history.It
  seems, however, to have been built originally above the site of an old
  Mithraic temple, which has recently been cleared out, and probably
  before the time of Gregory the Great.It was apparently rebuilt, or
  nearly so, by Adrian I., 772, and burnt by Robert Guiscard, 1084.The
  upper church seems to have been erected by Paschal, 1099-1118.The
  question is, to what age do the frescoes found on the walls of the
  older church belong?Some of the heads and single figures may, I
  fancy, be anterior even to the time of Adrian; but the bulk of the
  paintings seem certainly to have been added between his age and 1084,
  and nearer the latter than the former date.If it had not been
  entirely ruined in 1084 Paschal would not have so completely
  obliterated it a century afterwards.A considerable quantity of the
  materials of the old church were used in the new, which tends further
  to confuse the chronology.Footnote 263:

  The dates here given generally refer to the building now existing or

  giving a full quotation from Eusebius of Constantine’s basilica at
  Jerusalem, in which he points out that the orientation of primitive
  times is the reverse of that which has become general in later times,
  continues his enquiry into the evidence afforded by the numerous early
  basilicas in Rome itself.Of about fifty churches of early date, in
  forty of them the sanctuary is placed at the western end, and of the
  remaining ten (one of which is the great church of St.Paolo fuori le
  Mura), there are only seven which appear to have retained their
  original form, and which have an eastward sanctuary.The exact orientation of the sanctuary in each case has been added to
  the list.—ED.]Footnote 266:

  and four other domes.Procopius speaks of the church being surrounded
  within by columns placed both above and below, probably referring to
  galleries similar to those in St.Mark’s the columns exist in one storey only, and the main wall is
  carried up at the back of the aisles to give increased size inside.Footnote 280:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the

  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as
  the prototype of the most characteristic Lombard towers.—ED.]Footnote 305:

               next to p.I know no other mode by which I can seriously defend him
against this charge, than that which I am now pursuing; if your Lordship
wish to prevent me from pursuing it, you may as well tell me to abandon
my duty to my client at once."Lord Kenyon said: "Go on, Sir."Returning
to the analogy of the divinely ordered massacres in the Bible with the
like in nature, Kyd said:

"Gentlemen, this is reasoning by comparison; and reasoning by comparison
is often fallacious.On the present occasion the fallacy is this: that,
in the first case, the persons perish by the operation of the general
laws of nature, not suffering punishment for a crime; whereas, in the
latter, the general laws of nature are suspended or transgressed, and
God commands the slaughter to avenge his offended will.Is this then
a satisfactory answer to the objection?I think it is not; another may
think so too; which it may be fairly supposed the Author did; and then
the objection, as to him, remains in full force, and he cannot, from
insisting upon it, be fairly accused of malevolent intention."In his answer Erskine said: "The history of man is the history of man's
vices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to
their existence; many of the instances that have been referred to were
recorded as memorable warnings and examples for the instruction of
mankind."But for this argument Erskine was indebted to his old client,
Paine, who did not argue against the things being recorded, but against
the belief "that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and
children, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they
were done, at the command of God."Paine says: "Those accounts are
nothing to us, nor to any other persons, unless it be to the Jews, as
a part of the history of their nation; and there is just as much of
the word of God in those books as there is in any of the histories of
France, or Rapin's 'History of England,' or the history of any other
country."As in Paines own trial in 1792, the infallible scheme of a special jury
was used against Williams.Lord Kenyon closed his charge with the words:
"Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it
was published.It is, however, for you to judge of it, and to do justice
between the Public and the Defendant.""The jury instantly found the Defendant--Guilty."Paine at once wrote a letter to Erskine, which was first printed in
Paris.He calls attention to the injustice of the special jury system,
in which all the jurymen are nominated by the crown.In London a special
jury generally consists of merchants."Talk to some London merchants
about scripture, and they will understand you mean scrip, and tell you
how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.Ask them about Theology,
and they will say they know no such gentleman upon 'Change."He also
declares that Lord Kenyon's course in preventing Mr.Kyd from reading
passages from the Bible was irregular, and contrary to words, which he
cites, used by the same judge in another case.This Letter to Erskine contains some effective passages.In one of these
he points out the sophistical character of the indictment in declaring
the "Age of Reason" a blasphemous work, tending to bring in contempt
the holy scriptures."The charge should have stated that the work was
intended to prove certain books not the holy scriptures.It is one
thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain person; but it
is quite a different thing if I write to prove that such a work was not
written by such person.In the first case I attack the person through
the work; in the other case I defend the honour of the person against
the work."After alluding to the two accounts in Genesis of the creation
of man, according to one of which there was no Garden of Eden and no
forbidden tree, Paine says:

"Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have
often been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and
laudable pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the
obscure, and reconcile the contradictory, or, as they say, the seemingly
contradictory passages of the Bible.It is because the Bible needs such
an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is _not_
the word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind,
is in itself a volume.does not the Creator of the Universe, the
Fountain of all Wisdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all
Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write?When
we contemplate the vast economy of the creation, when we behold the
unerring regularity of the visible solar system, the perfection with
which all its several parts revolve, and by corresponding assemblage
form a whole;--when we launch our eye into the boundless ocean of space,
and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which
varies from its appointed place--when we trace the power of a Creator,
from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an universe, can we suppose
that the mind [which] could conceive such a design, and the power
that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without
inconsistence; or that a book so written can be the work of such a
power?The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no
commentator to explain, compound, arrange, and re-arrange their several
parts, to render them intelligible--he can relate a fact, or write an
essay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another;
certainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or
dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The
Bible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to mend
it."Paine admonishes Erskine that a prosecution to preserve God's word, were
it really God's word, would be like a prosecution to prevent the sun
from falling out of heaven; also that he should be able to comprehend
that the motives of those who declare the Bible not God's word
are religious.He then gives him an account of the new church of
Theophilanthropists in Paris, and appends his discourse before that
society.In the following year, Paine's discourse to the Theophilanthropists was
separately printed by Clio Rickman, with a sentence from Shakespeare
in the title-page: "I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment" There was also the following dedication:

"The following little Discourse is dedicated to the enemies of Thomas
Paine, by one who has known him long and intimately, and who is
convinced that he is the enemy of no man.It is printed to do good, by
a well wisher to the world.By one who thinks that discussion should
be unlimited, that all coercion is error; and that human beings should
adopt no other conduct towards each other but an appeal to truth and
reason."Paine wrote privately, in the same sense as to Erskine, to his
remonstrating friends.In one such letter (May 12th) he goes again
partly over the ground."You," he says, "believe in the Bible from the
accident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same
accident, and each calls the other _infidel_.This answer to your letter
is not written for the purpose of changing your opinion.It is written
to satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief
of the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God.""All
are infidels who believe falsely of God.""Belief in a cruel God makes a
cruel man."Paine had for some time been attaining unique fame in England.Some
publisher had found it worth while to issue a book, entitled "Tom
Paine's Jests: Being an entirely new and select Collection of Patriotic
Bon Mots, Repartees, Anecdotes, Epigrams, &c, on Political Subjects.There are hardly a half dozen items by Paine in the book
(72 pages), which shows that his name was considered marketable.The
government had made the author a cause.Erskine, who had lost his office
as Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales by becoming Paine's counsel
in 1792, was at once taken back into favor after prosecuting the "Age of
Reason," and put on his way to become Lord Erskine.The imprisonment of
Williams caused a reaction in the minds of those who had turned
against Paine.The terror
manifested at the name of Paine--some were arrested even for showing his
portrait--was felt to be political.None of the aristocratic deists, who
wrote for the upper classes, were dealt with in the same way.Paine had
proclaimed from the housetops what, as Dr.Watson confessed, scholars
were whispering in the ear.There were lampoons of Paine, such as
those of Peter Pindar (Rev.John Wolcott), but they only served to
whet popular curiosity concerning him.* The "Age of Reason" had passed
through several editions before it was outlawed, and every copy of it
passed through many hands.From the prosecution and imprisonment of
Williams may be dated the consolidation of the movement for the
"Rights of Man," with antagonism to the kind of Christianity which
that injustice illustrated.Political liberalism and heresy thenceforth
progressed in England, hand in hand.* "I have preserved," says Royall Tyler, "an epigram of
     Peter Pindar's, written originally in a blank leaf of a copy
     of Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and not inserted in any of his
     works."'Tommy Paine wrote this book to prove that the bible Was an old woman's
dream of fancies most idle; That Solomon's proverbs were made by low
livers, That prophets were fellows who sang semiquavers; That religion
and miracles all were a jest, And the devil in torment a tale of the
priest.Though Beelzebub's absence from hell I 'll maintain!Yet we all
must allow that the Devil's in Paine.'"THE REPUBLICAN ABDIEL

The sight of James Monroe and Thomas Paine in France, representing
Republican America, was more than Gouverneur Morris could stand.He sent
to Washington the abominable slander of Monroe already quoted (ii., p.173), and the Minister's recall came at the close of 1796.* Monroe
could not sail in midwinter with his family, so they remained until
the following spring.Paine made preparations to return to America
with them, and accompanied them to Havre; but he found so many "british
frigates cruising in sight" (so he writes Jefferson) that he did not
"trust [himself] to their discretion, and the more so as [he] had no
confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet" Sure enough this Captain
Clay was friendly enough with the British cruiser which lay in wait
to catch Paine, but only succeeded in finding his letter to Jefferson.Before returning from Havre to Paris he wrote another letter to
Vice-President Jefferson.* This sudden recall involved Monroe in heavy expenses,
     which Congress afterwards repaid.Frederick McGuire, of Washington, for the manuscript of
     Monroe's statement of his expenses and annoyances caused by
     his recall, which he declares due to "the representations
     which were made to him [Washington] by those in whom he
     confided."He states that Paine remained in his house a year
     and a half, and that be advanced him 250 louis d'or.For
     these services to Paine, he adds, "no claims were ever
     presented on my part, nor is any indemnity now desired."This money was repaid ($1,188) to Monroe by an Act of
     Congress, April 7, 1831.The advances are stated in the Act
     to have been made "from time to time," and were no doubt
     regarded by both Paine and Monroe as compensated by the many
     services rendered by the author to the Legation."Havre, May 14th, 1797."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you by the Ship Dublin Packet, Captain Clay,
mentioning my intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and
to have suggested to some Member of the House of Representatives the
propriety of calling Mr.Monroe before them to have enquired into the
state of their affairs in France.This might have laid the foundation
for some resolves on their part that might have led to an accommodation
with France, for that House is the only part of the American Government
that have any reputation here.Monroe of my design, and
he wishes to be called up."You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor has been
obliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the new
republic in Lombardy.How France will proceed with respect to England,
I am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am
inclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a
revolution in its Government.If this should be the plan, it will keep
me in Europe at least another year."As the british party has thrown the American commerce into wretched
confusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of
Consuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time
of peace; especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr.Skipwith,
who stood well with the Government here, has resigned.Cutting, the
Consul for Havre, does not reside at it, and the business is altogether
in the hands of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, [and]
cannot have the full authority proper for the office in the difficult
state matters are now in.I do not mention this to the disadvantage of
Mr.Cutting, for no man is more proper than himself if he thought it an
object to attend to."I know not if you are acquainted with Captain Johnson of
Massachusetts--he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American
Captains in the American employ.He is now settled at Havre and is a
more proper man for a Vice Consul than La Motte.He has written to some of his friends to have
the appointment and if you can see an opportunity of throwing in a
little service for him, you will do a good thing.He would be well received as an
individual, but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do nothing.The following, in Paine's handwriting, is copied from the original in
the Morrison papers, at the British Museum.It was written in the summer
of 1797, when Lord Malmsbury was at Lille in negotiation for peace.The negotiations were broken off because the English commissioners were
unauthorized to make the demanded restorations to Holland and Spain.Paine's essay was no doubt sent to the Directory in the interests of
peace, suggesting as it does a compromise, as regards the Cape of Good
Hope."Cape of Good Hope.--It is very well known that Dun-das, the English
Minister for Indian affairs, is tenacious of holding the Cape of Good
Hope, because it will give to the English East India Company a monopoly
of the commerce of India; and this, on the other hand, is the very
reason that such a claim is inadmissible by France, and by all the
nations trading in India and to Canton, and would also be injurious to
Canton itself.--We pretend not to know anything of the negociations at
Lille, but it is very easy to see, from the nature of the case, what
ought to be the condition of the Cape.It ought to be a free port open
to the vessels of all nations trading to any part of the East Indias.It
ought also to be a neutral port at all times, under the guarantee of
all nations; the expense of keeping the port in constant repair to
be defrayed by a tonnage tax to be paid by every vessel, whether
of commerce or of war, and in proportion to the time of their
stay.--Nothing then remains but with respect to the nation who shall be
the port-master; and this ought to be the Dutch, because they understand
the business best.As the Cape is a half-way stage between Europe and
India, it ought to be considered as a tavern, where travellers on a long
journey put up for rest and refreshment.--T.The suspension of peace negotiations,* and the bloodless defeat of
Pichigru's conspiracy of 18 Fructidor (September 4th) were followed by a
pamphlet addressed to "The People of France and the French Armies."This
little work is of historical value, in connection with 18 Fructidor, but
it was evidently written to carry two practical points.The first was,
that if the war with England must continue it should be directed to the
end of breaking the Anglo-Germanic compact.England has the right to
her internal arrangements, but this is an external matter.While "with
respect to England it has been the cause of her immense national debt,
the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of her bank," English
intrigues on the continent "are generated by, and act through, the
medium of this Anglo-Germanic compound.Let the elector retire to his electorate, and the world will have
peace."Paine's other main point is, that the neutral nations should
secure, in time of war, an unarmed neutrality.* In a letter to Duane, many years later, Paine relates the
     following story concerning the British Union: "When Lord
     Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the Directory
     Government, to open a negociation for a peace, his
     credentials ran in the old style of 'George, by the grace of
     God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king.'Malmsbury
     was informed that although the assumed title of king of
     France, in his credentials, would not prevent France opening
     a negociation, yet that no treaty of peace could be
     concluded until that assumed title was removed.Pitt then
     hit on the Union.Bill, under which the assumed title of
     king of France was discontinued.""Were the neutral nations to associate, under an honorable injunction of
fidelity to each other, and publickly declare to the world, that if any
belligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging
to the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that
association, that the whole association will shut its ports against the
flag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,
or merchandize, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or
appertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included
in the association, until reparation be made to the injured party; the
reparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo; and
moreover that all remittances in money, goods, and bills of exchange, do
cease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be
made.Were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their
direct interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of
neutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would
not But whilst, from want of a common system, they individually permit
England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it, they put
France under the necessity of doing the same thing.The supreme of all
laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation."It is a notable illustration of the wayward course of political
evolution, that the English republic--for it is such--grew largely out
of the very parts of its constitution once so oppressive.The foreign
origin of the royal family helped to form its wholesome timidity about
meddling with politics, allowing thus a development of ministerial
government.The hereditary character of the throne, which George
III.'s half-insane condition associated with the recklessness of
irresponsibility, was by his complete insanity made to serve ministerial
independence.Regency is timid about claiming power, and childhood
cannot exercise it.The decline of royal and aristocratic authority in
England secured freedom to commerce, which necessarily gave hostages to
peace.The protection of neutral commerce at sea, concerning which Paine
wrote so much, ultimately resulted from English naval strength, which
formerly scourged the world.To Paine, England, at the close of 1797, could appear only as a
dragon-guarded prison of fair Humanity.The press was paralyzed,
thinkers and publishers were in prison, some of the old orators like
Erskine were bought up, and the forlorn hope of liberty rested only with
Fox and his fifty in Parliament, overborne by a majority made brutal by
strength.The groans of imprisoned thought in his native land reached
its outlawed representative in Paris.And at the same time the inhuman
decree went forth from that country that there should be no peace with
France.It had long been his conviction that the readiness of Great
Britain to go to war was due to an insular position that kept the
horrors at a distance.This conviction,
which we have several times met in these pages, returned to him with new
force when England now insisted on more bloodshed.He was convinced that
the right course of France would be to make a descent on England, ship
the royal family to Hanover, open the political prisons, and secure the
people freedom to make a Constitution.These views, freely expressed
to his friends of the Directory and Legislature, reached the ears of
Napoleon on his triumphal return from Italy.The great man called upon Paine in his little room, and invited him
to dinner.He made the eloquent professions of republicanism so
characteristic of Napoleons until they became pretenders.He told Paine
that he slept with the "Rights of Man" under his pillow, and that its
author ought to have a statue of gold.*

     * Rickman, p.He consulted Paine about a descent on England, and adopted the plan.He
invited the author to accompany the expedition, which was to consist of
a thousand gun-boats, with a hundred men each.Paine consented, "as
[so he wrote Jefferson] the intention of the expedition was to give the
people of England an opportunity of forming a government for themselves,
and thereby bring about peace."One of the points to be aimed at was
Norfolk, and no doubt Paine indulged a happy vision of standing once
more in Thetford and proclaiming liberty throughout the land!The following letter (December 29, 1797) from Paine to Barras is in the
archives of the Directory, with a French translation:

"Citizen President,--A very particular friend of mine, who had a
passport to go to London upon some family affairs and to return in three
months, and whom I had commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for
I find that the English government has seized upon a thousand pounds
sterling which I had in the hands of a friend), returned two days ago
and gave me the memorandum which I enclose:--the first part relates only
to my publication on the event of the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to
Erskine (who had been counsel for the prosecution against a former
work of mine the 'Age of Reason') both of which I desired my friend to
publish in London.The other part of the memorandum respects the state
of affairs in that country, by which I see they have little or no idea
of a descent being made upon them; tant mieux--but they will be guarded
in Ireland, as they expect a descent there."I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two.As
this is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to the Citizen
Revelliere Le Peaux, I will send it to him.The friend of whom I speak
was a pupil of Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to
you at a public audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan
respecting the Island of Bermuda.--Salut et Respect."{1798}

Thus once again did the great hope of a liberated, peaceful, and
republican Europe shine before simple-hearted Paine.He was rather poor
now, but gathered up all the money he had, and sent it to the Council of
Five Hundred.The accompanying letter was read by Coupe at the sitting
of January 28, 1798:

"Citizens Representatives,--Though it is not convenient to me, in the
present situation of my affairs, to subscribe to the loan towards the
descent upon England, my economy permits me to make a small patriotic
donation.I send a hundred livres, and with it all the wishes of my
heart for the success of the descent, and a voluntary offer of any
service I can render to promote it."There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until
the tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
England, like Italy, become a sister republic.As to those men, whether
in England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are
covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than in
committing more.But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free."Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old
colleague in the dangers we have passed, and on the happy prospect
before us.Coupe added: "The gift which Thomas Paine offers you appears very
trifling, when it is compared with the revolting injustice which this
faithful friend of liberty has experienced from the English government;
but compare it with the state of poverty in which our former colleague
finds himself, and you will then think it considerable."He moved that
the notice of this gift and Thomas Paine's letter be printed."Mention
honorable et impression," adds the Moniteur.The President of the Directory at this time was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, a
friend of the Theophilanthropic Society.To him Paine gave, in English,
which the president understood, a plan for the descent, which was
translated into French, and adopted by the Directory.Two hundred and
fifty gun-boats were built, and the expedition abandoned.To Jefferson,
Paine intimates his suspicion that it was all "only a feint to cover the
expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing."He also states that the
British descent on Ostend, where some two thousand of them were made
prisoners, "was in search of the gun-boats, and to cut the <DW18>s, to
prevent their being assembled."This he was told by Vanhuile, of Bruges,
who heard it from the British officers.After the failure of his attempt to return to America with the Monroes,
Paine was for a time the guest of Nicolas de Bonneville, in Paris,
and the visit ended in an arrangement for his abode with that family.Bonneville was an editor, thirty-seven years of age, and had been one of
the five members of Paine's Republican Club, which placarded Paris with
its manifesto after the king's flight in 1791.An enthusiastic
devotee of Paine's principles from youth, he had advocated them in
his successive journals, _Le Tribun du Peuple, Bouche de Fer, and
Bien Informe_.He had resisted Marat and Robespierre, and suffered
imprisonment during the Terror.He spoke English fluently, and was
well known in the world of letters by some striking poems, also by his
translation into French of German tales, and parts of Shakespeare.He
had set up a printing office at No.4 Rue du Theatre-Francais, where he
published liberal pamphlets, also his _Bien Informe_.Then, in 1794, he
printed in French the "Age of Reason."He also published, and probably
translated into French, Paine's letter to the now exiled Camille
Jordan,--"Lettre de Thomas Paine, sur les Cultes."Paine, unable to
converse in French, found with the Bonnevilles a home he needed.M. and
Madame Bonneville had been married three years, and their second child
had been named after Thomas Paine, who stood as his godfather.Paine,
as we learn from Rickman, who knew the Bonnevilles, paid board, but no
doubt he aided Bonneville more by his pen.With public affairs, either in France or America, Paine now mingled but
little.The election of John Adams to the presidency he heard of with
dismay.He wrote to Jefferson that since he was not president, he was
glad he had accepted the vice-presidency, "for John Adams has such a
talent for blundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye
over him."Finding, by the abandonment of a descent on.England for
one on Egypt, that Napoleon was by no means his ideal missionary of
republicanism, he withdrew into his little study, and now remained so
quiet that some English papers announced his arrival and cool reception
in America.He was, however, fairly bored with visitors from all parts
of the world, curious to see the one international republican left.It became necessary for Madame Bonneville, armed with polite
prevarications, to defend him from such sight-seers.For what with
his visits to and from the Barlows, the Smiths, and his friends of the
Directory, Paine had too little time for the inventions in which he was
again absorbed,--his "Saints."Among his intimate friends at this time
was Robert Fulton, then residing in Paris.Paine's extensive studies
of the steam-engine, and his early discovery, of its adaptability to
navigation, had caused Rumsey to seek him in England, and Fitch to
consult him both in America and Paris.Paine's connection with the
invention of the steamboat was recognized by Fulton, as indeed by all of
his scientific contemporaries.* To Fulton he freely gave his ideas,
and may perhaps have had some hope that the steamboat might prove a
missionary of international republicanism, though Napoleon had failed.* Sir Richard Phillips says: "In 1778 Thomas Paine proposed,
     in America, this application of steam."("Million of Facts,"
     p.As Sir Richard assisted Fulton in his experiments
     on the Thames, he probably heard from him the fact about
     Paine, though, indeed, in the controversy between Rumsey and
     Fitch, Paine's priority to both was conceded.In America,
     however, the priority really belonged to the eminent
     mechanician William Henry, of Lancaster, Pa.When Fitch
     visited Henry, in 1785, he was told by him that he was not
     the first to devise steam-navigation; that he himself had
     thought of it in 1776, and mentioned it to Andrew Ellicott;
     and that Thomas Paine, while a guest at his house in 1778,
     had spoken to him on the subject I am indebted to Mr.John
     W. Jordan, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, for
     notes from the papers of Henry, his ancestor, showing that
     Paine's scheme was formed without knowledge of others, and
     that it contemplated a turbine application of steam to a
     wheel.Both he and Henry, as they had not published their
     plans, agreed to leave Fitch the whole credit.Fitch
     publicly expressed his gratitude to Paine.Thurston adds
     that Paine, in 1788, proposed that Congress should adopt the
     whole matter for the national benefit.("History of the
     Growth of the Steam Engine," pp.It will not be forgotten that in the same year in which Paine startled
William Henry with a plan for steam-navigation, namely in 1778, he wrote
his sublime sentence about the "Religion of Humanity."The steamships,
which Emerson described as enormous shuttles weaving the races of
men into the woof of humanity, have at length rendered possible that
universal human religion which Paine foresaw.In that old Lancaster
mansion of the Henrys, which still stands, Paine left his spectacles,
now in our National Museum; they are strong and far-seeing; through them
looked eyes held by visions that the world is still steadily following.One cannot suppress some transcendental sentiment in view of
the mystical harmony of this man's inventions for human
welfare,--mechanical, political, religious.Of his gunpowder motor,
mention has already been made (i., p.On this he was engaged
about the time that he was answering Bishop Watson's book on the "Age of
Reason."He could not believe, he said,
that the qualities of gunpowder--the small and light grain with maximum
of force--were meant only for murder, and his faith in the divine
humanity is in the sentence.To supersede destroying gunpowder with
beneficent gunpowder, and to supersede the god of battles with the God
of Love, were kindred aims in Paine's heart Through the fiery furnaces
of his time he had come forth with every part of his being welded and
beaten and shaped together for this Human Service.Patriotism, in the
conventional sense, race-pride, sectarianism, partizanship, had been
burnt out of his nature.The universe could not have wrung from his
tongue approval of a wrong because it was done by his own country.It might be supposed that there were no heavier trials awaiting Paine's
political faith than those it had undergone.But it was becoming evident
that liberty had not the advantage he once ascribed to truth over
error,--"it cannot be unlearned."The United States had unlearned it as
far as to put into the President's hands a power of arbitrarily crushing
political opponents, such as even George III.The
British Treaty had begun to bear its natural fruits.Washington signed
the Treaty to avoid war, and rendered war inevitable with both France
and England.The affair with France was happily a transient squall, but
it was sufficient to again bring on Paine the offices of an American
Minister in France.Many an American in that country had occasion to
appreciate his powerful aid and unfailing kindness.Among these was
Captain Rowland Crocker of Massachusetts, who had sailed with a letter
of marque.'His vessel was captured by the French, and its wounded
commander brought to Paris, where he was more agreeably conquered by
kindness.Freeman's "History of Cape Cod" (of which region Crocker was a
native) has the following:

"His [Captain Crocker's] reminiscences of his residence in that country,
during the most extraordinary period of its history, were of a highly
interesting character.He had taken the great Napoleon by the hand; he
had familiarly known Paine, at a time when his society was sought for
and was valuable.Of this noted individual, we may in passing say, with
his uniform and characteristic kindness, he always spoke in terms which
sounded strange to the ears of a generation which has been taught, with
or without justice, to regard the author of 'The Age of Reason' with
loathing and abhorrence.He remembered Paine as a well-dressed and most
gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox republican principles, of a good
heart, a strong intellect, and a fascinating address."{1799}

The _coup d'etat_ in America, which made President Adams virtual
emperor, pretended constitutionality, and was reversible.That which
Napoleon and Sieves--who had his way at last--effected in France
(November 9, 1799) was lawless and fatal.The peaceful Bonneville home
was broken up.Bonneville, in his _Bien Informe_ described Napoleon as
"a Cromwell," and was promptly imprisoned.Paine, either before or soon
after this catastrophe, went to Belgium, on a visit to his old friend
Vanhuile, who had shared his cell in the Luxembourg prison.Vanhuile
was now president of the municipality of Bruges, and Paine got from him
information about European affairs.On his return he found Bonneville
released from prison, but under severe surveillance, his journal being
suppressed.The family was thus reduced to penury and anxiety, but there
was all the more reason that Paine should stand by them.He continued
his abode in their house, now probably supported by drafts on his
resources in America, to which country they turned their thoughts.{1800}

The European Republic on land having become hopeless, Paine turned
his attention to the seas.He wrote a pamphlet on "Maritime Compact,"
including in it ten articles for the security of neutral commerce, to
be signed by the nations entering the "Unarmed Association," which he
proposed.This scheme was substantially the same as that already quoted
from his letter "To the People of France, and to the French Armies."It was translated by Bonneville, and widely circulated in Europe.Paine
sent it in manuscript to Jefferson, who at once had it printed.His
accompanying letter to Jefferson (October i, 1800) is of too much
biographical interest to be abridged.* Oliver Ellsworth, William V. Murray, and William R. Davie,
     were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a
     treaty.There is little doubt that the famous letter of Joel
     Barlow to Washington, October 2, 1798, written in the
     interest of peace, was composed after consultation with
     Paine.Adams, on reading the letter, abused Barlow."Tom
     Paine," he said, "is not a more worthless fellow."But he
     obeyed the letter.The Commissioners he sent were associated
     with the anti-French and British party in America, but peace
     with America was of too much importance to the new despot of
     France for the opportunity to be missed of forming a Treaty."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the
year 1797.It was then my intention to return to America; but there were
so many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after
a few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did
not think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,
as I had no confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).I
mentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'
the hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not
President that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.have been here about eight months,
and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.Their
presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit They
set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived.Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
returning the visits of Mr.Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,
they had not the confidence of the executive.Every known republican was
treated in the same manner.Miller of Philadelphia,
who had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend to
return my visit, if I made one.This I supposed it was intended I should
know, that I might not make one.I told him, I did not come to see him as a
commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to
see him because I had formerly known him in Congress.I mean not, said
I, to press you with any questions, or to engage you in any conversation
upon the business you are come upon, but I will nevertheless candidly
say that I know not what expectations the Government or the people of
America may have of your mission, or what expectations you may have
yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but little.The
treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your business.The
American Government never did two more foolish things than when it
signed that Treaty and recalled Mr.Monroe, who was the only man could
do them any service.Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a Judge,
and was silent.I added, you may perhaps make a treaty like that you
have made with England, which is a surrender of the rights of the
American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make neutral
property must be general or not at all.I then changed the subject, for
I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired after Sam.Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr.Monroe, and
others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow fever,--of
which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been summing
up a case to a Jury.Ellsworth been as
cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my
visit that he might appear insensible of the intention of mine."I now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe.You will, I
suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of
Marengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice
in consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa, etc., to
the french--of the successes of the french army in Germany--and the
extension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of
peace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to
ratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the
french Government in consequence of that refusal--of the 'gallant'
expedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his
pompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put
in all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of
General Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the
Army, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise,
unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within
45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany
(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstad), as security that he would sign them.This is the state things [they] are now in, at the time of writing this
letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign
the preliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be
admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to
by the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,
before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.From
all which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor
is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of
getting out but by a peace.The Congress for the peace is to be held
at Luneville, a town in france.Since the affair of Rastadt the french
commissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.I know not what the Commissioners have
done, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have
some authority, it is not much.The paper as you will perceive is
considerably prior to this letter.I knew that the Commissioners before
this piece appeared intended setting off.It is therefore probable that
what they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which
certainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,
neither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the
business."But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
treaties unnecessary.In the first place I doubt if any peace will be
made with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
the seas.This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.1, without any title, was written in consequence of
a question put to me by Bonaparte.As he supposed I knew England
and English Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of
negociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include
England.Julian was in Paris, on the part of the
Emperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the
Emperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at
Sea_, was written when the English made their insolent and impolitic
expedition to Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No.I shewed it to a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french,
and printed in the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the
foreign Ministers, and persons in the Government.It was immediately
copied into several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper,
the Moniteur.It appeared in this paper one day before the last
dispatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said
respecting Egypt.It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact
proper moment.3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No.It is translating at the time I write this letter,
and I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.The pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential
person, where they will be published."By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
meditating against England.It is now given for certain that Paul has
embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till
some principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral
Nations, and securing the liberty of the Seas.The preparations in
Denmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with
England, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by
England to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided.I send you the
paragraphs upon the subject."The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the
excessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.I attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the
non-circulation of cash, than to any other cause, People in trade
can push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by
continental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity
they endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance."I have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I
trouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the
Commissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,
otherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his
place."In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from
them, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her
while to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of
those circumstances which, if they go on will render partial treaties
useless by deranging them.But if, in the mean time, she enters into
any treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:
Reserving to herself the right of joining in an association of Nations
for the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of
the liberty of the Seas."The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press.They will make a small pamphlet
and the printers are welcome to put my name to it.It is best it should
be put from thence; they will get into the newspapers.I know that the
faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily.It
does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I
am doing America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for nothing.1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends."I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject.Ellsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to
Holland, and in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr.Skipwith
that has been in the habit of transacting business with the french
Government since the revolution began.He is on a good standing with
them, and if the chance of the day should place you in the presidency
you cannot do better than appoint him for any purpose you may have
occasion for in France.He is an honest man and will do his country
Justice, and that with civility and good manners to the government he
is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy
Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never
possessed.Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr.It is upon
the fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not
communicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he
know, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have
intention to do it."I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the
progress of Iron Bridges.Burke's attack
upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works.Since my coming from
England in '92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span versed
sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my
model was, and erected over the river Wear at Sunderland in the county
of Durham in England.The two members in Parliament for the County,
Mr.Milbank, were the principal subscribers; but the
direction was committed to Mr.A very sincere friend of mine,
Sir Robert Smyth, who lives in france, and whom Mr.Monroe well knows,
supposing they had taken their plan from my model wrote to Mr.Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have
by me and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge: 'With
respect to the Bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland it certainly is
a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure, durability
and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was
taken from Mr.Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington.But with respect
to any compensation to Mr.Paine, however desirous of rewarding the
labours of an ingenious man, I see not how it is in my power, having had
nothing to do with his bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr.But if you can point out
any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.P. any
compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from
his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great
satisfaction.'"I have now made two other models, one is pasteboard, five feet span
and five inches of height from the cords.It is in the opinion of every
person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can
behold.I then cast a model in Metal following the construction of that
in pasteboard and of the same dimensions.The whole was executed in my
own Chamber.It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris.I
shall bring those Models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
as I can pass the seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls."I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Landaff's
answer to my second part of the Age of reason.As soon as I got a
copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an answer to the
Bishop; but as soon as the clerical Society for promoting _Christian
Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted,
as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to prevent that
answer appearing.No other reason than this can be assigned for their
prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had been in
circulation above three years and the second part more than one, and
they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their
Champion.Burke's attack on the french
revolution; served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects
upon, with more advantage than if the background was not there.This is
the motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone
on without taking any notice of him.I have made and am still making
additions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an
opportunity arrive for publishing it."If any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of
it fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
returning.The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is
entirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health.This is
the first of October, and Mr.Skipwith has just called to tell me the
Commissioners set off for Havre tomorrow.This will go by the frigate
but not with the knowledge of the Commissioners.Remember me with much
affection to my friends and accept the same to yourself."As the Commissioners did not leave when they expected, Paine added
several other letters to Jefferson, on public affairs.In one (October
1st) he says he has information of increasing aversion in the English
people to their government."It was the hope of conquest, and is now the
hope of peace that keeps it [Pitt's administration] up."When
suspicion wakes the credit vanishes as the dream would.""England has a
large Navy, and the expense of it leads to her ruin."The English nation
is tired of war, longs for peace, "and calculates upon defeat as
it would upon victory."On October 4th, after the Commissioners had
concluded a treaty, Paine alludes to an article said to be in it,
requiring certain expenditures in France, and says that if he,
Jefferson, be "in the chair, and not otherwise," he should offer himself
for this business, should an agent be required "It will serve to defray
my expenses until I can return, but I wish it may be with the condition
of returning.I am not tired of working for nothing, but I cannot afford
it.This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I am now upon
of a law of nations for the protection of neutral commerce."On October
6th he reports to Jefferson that at an entertainment given the American
envoys, Consul Le Brun gave the toast: "A l'union de l'Amerique avec les
puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberte des mers."On October
15th the last of his enclosures to Jefferson is written.He says that
Napoleon, when asked if there would be more war, replied: "Nous
n'aurions plus qu'une guerre d'ecritoire."In all of Paine's writing
about Napoleon, at this time, he seems as if watching a thundercloud,
and trying to make out meteorologically its drift, and where it will
strike.{1801}

On July 15, 1801, Napoleon concluded with Pius VII.Naturally, the first victim offered on the restored altar was
Theophilan-thropy.I have called Paine the founder of this Society,
because it arose amid the controversy excited by the publication of "Le
Siecle de la Raison," its manual and tracts reproducing his ideas and
language; and because he gave the inaugural discourse.Theism was little
known in France save as iconoclasm, and an assault on the Church: Paine
treated it as a Religion.But, as he did not speak French, the practical
organization and management of the Society were the work of others, and
mainly of a Russian named Hauey.There had been a good deal of odium
incurred at first by a society which satisfied neither the pious nor the
freethinkers, but it found a strong friend on the Directory.This
was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, whose secretary, Antoine Vallee, and young
daughter, had become interested in the movement.This statesman never
joined the Society, but he had attended one of its meetings, and, when
a distribution of religious edifices was made, Theophilanthropy was
assigned ten parish churches.It is said that when Larevelliere-Lepeaux
mentioned to Talleyrand his desire for the spread of this Society, the
diplomat said: "All you have to do is to get yourself hanged, and revive
the third day."Paine, who had pretty nearly fulfilled that requirement,
saw the Society spread rapidly, and he had great hopes of its future.also had an interested eye on it, and though the
Concordat did not go into legal operation until 1802, Theophilanthropy
was offered as a preliminary sacrifice in October, 1801.The description of Paine by Walter Savage Landor, and representations
of his talk, in the "Imaginary Conversations," so mix up persons, times,
and places, that I was at one time inclined to doubt whether the two had
met.J. M. Wheeler, a valued correspondent in London, writes
me: "Landor told my friend Mr.Birch of Florence that he particularly
admired Paine, and that he visited him, having first obtained an
interview at the house of General Dumouriez.Landor declared that Paine
was always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a
jolly good fellow."An interview with Paine at the house of Dumouriez
could only have occurred when the General was in Paris, in 1793.This
would account for what Landor says of Paine taking refuge from trouble
in brandy.There had been, as, Rickman testifies, and as all the facts
show, nothing of this kind since that period.It would appear therefore
that Landor must have mixed up at least two interviews with Paine, one
in the time of Dumouriez, the other in that of Napoleon.Not even
such an artist as Landor could invent the language ascribed to Paine
concerning the French and Napoleon."The whole nation may be made as enthusiastic about a salad as about a
constitution; about the colour of a cockade as about a consul or a king.You will shortly see the real strength and figure of Bonaparte.He is
wilful, headstrong, proud, morose, presumptuous; he will be guided no
longer; he has pulled the pad from his forehead, and will break his nose
or bruise his cranium against every table, chair, and brick in the room,
until at last he must be sent to the hospital."Paine prophesies that Napoleon will make himself emperor, and that "by
his intemperate use of power and thirst of dominion" he will cause the
people to "wish for their old kings, forgetting what beasts they were."Normandy" Landor disguises Thomas Poole,
referred to on a preceding page.Normandy's sufferings on account of one
of Paine's books are not exaggerated.Sanford's work is printed
a letter from Paris, July 20, 1802, in which Poole says: "I called one
Morning on Thomas Paine.Striking,
strong physiognomy.Said a great many quaint things, and read us part of
a reply which he intends to publish to Watson's 'Apology.'"* "Thomas Poole and His Friends," ii., p.Paine seems to have had no relation with the ruling powers at this time,
though an Englishman who visited him is quoted by Rickman (p.198) as
remarking his manliness and fearlessness, and that he spoke as freely as
ever after Bonaparte's supremacy.One communication only to any member
of the government appears; this was to the Minister of the Interior
concerning a proposed iron bridge over the Seine.* Political France and
Paine had parted.Under date of March 18, 1801, President Jefferson informs Paine that he
had sent his manuscripts (Maritime Compact) to the printer to be made
into a pamphlet, and that the American people had returned from their
frenzy against France.He adds:

"You expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public
vessel.Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland
to receive and accommodate you back if you can be ready to depart
at such short warning.R. Livingston is appointed minister
plenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till
we receive the ratification of the convention by Mr.** I am in
hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former
times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with
as much effect as any man living.That you may long live to continue
your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of
nations, is my sincere prayer.Accept assurances of my high esteem and
affectionate attachment."*  "The Minister of the Interior to Thomas Paine: I have
     received, Citizen, the observations that you have been so
     good as to address to me upon the construction of iron
     bridges.They will be of the greatest utility to us when the
     new kind of construction goes to be executed for the first
     time.With pleasure I assure you, Citizen, that you have
     rights of more than one kind to the gratitude of nations,
     and I give you, cordially, the expression of my particular
     esteem.--Chaptal."It is rather droll, considering the appropriation of his
     patent in England, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
     belonging to him, to find Paine casually mentioning that at
     this time a person came from London with plans and drawings
     to consult with him about an iron arch of 600 feet, over the
     Thames, then under consideration by a committee of the House
     of Commons.**  "Beau Dawson," an eminent Virginia Congressman.The subjoined notes are from letters of Paine to Jefferson:

_Paris, June 9, 1801_.Dawson gave me
the real sensation of happy satisfaction, and what served to increase
it was that he brought it to me himself before I knew of his arrival.There has been no circumstance
with respect to America since the times of her revolution that excited
so much attention and expectation in France, England, Ireland, and
Scotland as the pending election for President of the United States, nor
any of which the event has given more general joy:

"I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the
Maryland, but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr."The Parliamentaire, from America to Havre,
was taken in going out, and carried into England.The pretence, as the
papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for America.If
I had happened to have been there, I suppose they would have made no
ceremony in conducting me on shore."*




{1802}

_Paris, March 17,1802_."As it is now Peace, though the definitive
Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by the first opportunity from
Havre or Dieppe, after the equinoctial gales are over.I continue in
excellent health, which I know your friendship will be glad to hear
of.--Wishing you and America every happiness, I remain your former
fellow-labourer and much obliged fellow-citizen."Paine's determination not to return to America in a national vessel was
owing to a paragraph he saw in a Baltimore paper, headed "Out at Last."It stated that Paine had written to the President, expressing a wish to
return by a national ship, and that "permission was given."There was
here an indication that Jefferson's invitation to Paine by the Hon.John
Dawson had become known to the President's enemies, and that Jefferson,
on being attacked, had apologized by making the matter appear an act
of charity.Paine would not believe that the President was personally
responsible for the apologetic paragraph, which seemed inconsistent with
the cordiality of the letter brought by Dawson; but, as he afterwards
wrote to Jefferson, "it determined me not to come by a national ship."*
His request had been made at a time when any other than a national
American ship was pretty certain to land him in an English prison.There
was evidently no thought of any _eclat_ in the matter, but no doubt a
regard for economy as well as safety.Jefferson had been charged
     with sending a national ship to France for the sole purpose
     of bringing Paine home, and Paine himself would have been
     the first to condemn such an assumption of power.Although
     the President's adherents thought it right to deny this,
     Jefferson wrote to Paine that he had nothing to do with the
     paragraph."With respect to the letter [offering the ship] I
     never hesitate to avow and justify it in conversation.In no
     other way do I trouble myself to contradict anything which
     is said.At that time, however, there were anomalies in the
     motions of some of our friends which events have at length
     reduced to regularity."The following to the eminent deist lecturer in New York, Elihu Palmer,
bears the date, "Paris, February 21, 1802, since the Fable of Christ":

"Dear Friend, I received, by Mr.Livingston, the letter you wrote me,
and the excellent work you have published ["The Principles of Nature"].I see you have thought deeply on the subject, and expressed your
thoughts in a strong and clear style.The hinting and intimating manner
of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind, produced
skepticism, but not conviction.Some people
can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it.Say a
bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think."There is an intimate friend of mine, Colonel Joseph Kirk-bride of
Bordentown, New Jersey, to whom I would wish you to send your work.He
is an excellent man, and perfectly in our sentiments.You can send it by
the stage that goes partly by land and partly by water, between New York
and Philadelphia, and passes through Bordentown."I expect to arrive in America in May next.I have a third part of the
Age of Reason to publish when I arrive, which, if I mistake not, will
make a stronger impression than any thing I have yet published on the
subject."I write this by an ancient colleague of mine in the French Convention,
the citizen Lequinio, who is going [as] Consul to Rhode Island, and who
waits while I write.The following, dated July 8, 1802, to Consul Rotch, is the last letter I
find written by Paine from Paris:

"My Dear Friend,--The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go
to America.He is willing to do anything on board a ship to lesson the
expense of his passage.If you know any captain to whom such a person
may be usefull I will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted
to take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negociate some
arrangements of Commerce, I have given up that idea.I wait now for the
arrival of a person from England whom I want to see,** after which, I
shall bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe.I am with affectionate
esteem to you and Mrs.Rotch,

"Yours,

"Thomas Paine."* J. M. Lequinio, author of "Prejudices Destroyed," and
     other rationalistic works, especially dealt with in
     Priestley's "Letters to the Philosophers of France."The President's cordial letter had raised a happy vision before the eyes
of one sitting amid the ruins of his republican world.As he said of
Job, he had "determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
upon himself the hard duty of contentment."Of the comrades with whom he
began the struggle for liberty in France but a small circle remained.As he wrote to Lady Smith,--from whom he must now part,--"I might almost
say like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Of the American and
English friends who cared for him when he came out of prison few remain.The President's letter came to a poor man in a small room, furnished
only with manuscripts and models of inventions.Here he was found by
an old friend from England, Henry Redhead Yorke, who, in 1795, had been
tried in England for sedition.Yorke has left us a last glimpse of the
author in "wretched and restless Europe."The "rights of man" had become
so antiquated in Napoleon's France, that Yorke found Paine's name odious
on account of his antislavery writings, the people "ascribing to his
espousal of the rights of the <DW64>s of St.Domingo the resistance
which Leclercq had experienced from them."A "jolly-looking woman" (in whom we recognize
Madame Bonneville) scrutinized Yorke severely, but was smiling enough
on learning that he was Paine's old friend.He was ushered into a little
room heaped with boxes of documents, a chaos of pamphlets and journals.While Yorke was meditating on the contrast between this habitation of a
founder of two great republics and the mansions of their rulers, his old
friend entered, dressed in a long flannel gown."Time seemed to have made dreadful ravages over his whole frame, and a
settled melancholy was visible on his countenance.He desired me to be
seated, and although he did not recollect me for a considerable time,
he conversed with his usual affability.I confess I felt extremely
surprised that he should have forgotten me; but I resolved not to make
myself known to him, as long as it could be avoided with propriety.In
order to try his memory, I referred to a number of circumstances which
had occurred while we were in company, but carefully abstained from
hinting that we had ever lived together.He would frequently put his
hand to his forehead, and exclaim, 'Ah!I know that voice, but my
recollection fails!'At length I thought it time to remove his suspense,
and stated an incident which instantly recalled me to his mind.It
is impossible to describe the sudden change which this effected; his
countenance brightened, he pressed me by the hand, and a silent tear
stole down his cheek.For some
time we sat without a word escaping from our lips.'Thus are we met once
more, Mr.Paine,' I resumed, 'after a long separation of ten years,
and after having been both of us severely weather-beaten.''Aye,' he
replied, 'and who would have thought that we should meet in Paris?'He then enquired what motive had brought me here, and on my explaining
myself, he observed with a smile of contempt, 'They have shed blood
enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection.This is not a
country for an honest man to live in; they do not understand any thing
at all of the principles of free government, and the best way is to
leave them to themselves.You see they have conquered all Europe, only
to make it more miserable than it was before.'Upon this, I remarked
that I was surprised to hear him speak in such desponding language of
the fortune of mankind, and that I thought much might yet be done for
the Republic.he exclaimed, 'do you call this a Republic?Why they are worse off than the slaves of Constantinople; for there,
they expect to be bashaws in heaven by submitting to be slaves below,
but here they believe neither in heaven nor hell, and yet are slaves by
choice.I know of no Republic in the world except America, which is the
only country for such men as you and I. It is my intention to get away
from this place as soon as possible, and I hope to be off in the autumn;
you are a young man and may see better times, but I have done with
Europe, and its slavish politics.'"I have often been in company with Mr.Paine, since my arrival here, and
I was not a little surprised to find him wholly indifferent about the
public spirit in England, or the remaining influence of his doctrines
among its people.Indeed he seemed to dislike the mention of the
subject; and when, one day, in order to provoke discussion, I told him
I had altered my opinions upon many of his principles, he answered, 'You
certainly have the right to do so; but you cannot alter the nature
of things; the French have alarmed all honest men; but still truth is
truth.Though you may not think that my principles are practicable in
England, without bringing on a great deal of misery and confusion, you
are, I am sure, convinced of their justice.'Here he took occasion to
speak in terms of the utmost severity of Mr------, who had obtained
a seat in parliament, and said that 'parsons were always mischievous
fellows when they turned politicians.'This gave rise to an observation
respecting his 'Age of Reason,' the publication of which I said had
lost him the good opinion of numbers of his English advocates.He
became uncommonly warm at this remark, and in a tone of singular energy
declared that he would not have published it if he had not thought it
calculated to 'inspire mankind with a more exalted idea of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, and to put an end to villainous imposture.'He then broke out with the most violent invectives against our received
opinions, accompanying them at the same time with some of the most grand
and sublime conceptions of an Omnipotent Being, that I ever heard or
read of.In the support of his opinion, he avowed himself ready to
lay down his life, and said 'the Bishop of Llandaff may roast me in
Smithfield if he likes, but human torture cannot shake my conviction.'He reached down a copy of the Bishop's work, interleaved with remarks
upon it, which he read me; after which he admitted the liberality of
the Bishop, and regretted that in all controversies among men a similar
temper was not maintained.But in proportion as he appeared listless in
politics, he seemed quite a zealot in his religious creed; of which the
following is an instance.An English lady of our acquaintance, not less
remarkable for her talents than for elegance of manners, entreated me to
contrive that she might have an interview with Mr.In consequence
of this I invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favoured
with her company.But as she is a very rigid Roman Catholic I cautioned
Mr.Paine, beforehand, against touching upon religious subjects,
assuring him at the same time that she felt much interested to make his
acquaintance.With much good nature he promised to be _discreet_.... For
above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and admiration of
his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his numberless
anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of Franklin,
Washington, and even of his Majesty, of whom he told several curious
facts of humour and benevolence.His remarks on genius and taste can
never be forgotten by those present.Thus far everything went on as I
could wish; the sparkling champagne gave a zest to his conversation,
and we were all delighted.an expression relating to his
'Age of Reason' having been mentioned by one of the company, he broke
out immediately.He began with Astronomy,--addressing himself to Mrs.Y.,--he declared that the least inspection of the motion of the stars
was a convincing proof that Moses was a liar.In
vain I attempted to change the subject, by employing every artifice in
my power, and even attacking with vehemence his political principles.He returned to the charge with unabated ardour.I called upon him for a
song though I never heard him sing in my life.He struck up one of
his own composition; but the instant he had finished it he resumed his
favourite topic.I felt extremely mortified, and remarked that he had
forgotten his promise, and that it was not fair to wound so deeply the
opinions of the ladies.said he, 'they 'll come again.What a pity
it is that people should be so prejudiced!'To which I retorted that
their prejudices might be virtues.'If so,' he replied, 'the blossoms
may be beautiful to the eye, but the root is weak.'One of the most
extraordinary properties belonging to Mr.Paine is his power of
retaining everything he has written in the course of his life.It is
a fact that he can repeat word for word every sentence in his 'Common
Sense,' 'Rights of Man,' etc., etc.The Bible is the only book which he
has studied, and there is not a verse in it that is not familiar to him.In shewing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised
he observed that Dr.Franklin once told him that 'books are written to
please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridges
for the people.'These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only
of skill but of taste; and are wrought with extreme delicacy entirely
by his own hands.The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron
works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged
and manufactured by himself.It is intended as the model of a bridge
which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
only one arch.The other is to be erected over a lesser river,
whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own
workmanship, excepting the chains, which, instead of iron, are cut out
of pasteboard, by the fair hand of his correspondent the 'Little Corner
of the World,' whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.He was
offered L3000 for these models and refused it.The iron bars, which
I before mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also
forged by himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description.He put
them together, and exhibited the power of the lever to a most surprising
degree."'*"Letters from France," etc., London, 1804, 2 vols., 8vo.Thirty-three pages of the last letter are devoted to Paine.About this time Sir Robert Smith died, and another of the ties to Paris
was snapped.His beloved Bonnevilles promised to follow him to the New
World.His old friend Rickman has come over to see him off, and observed
that "he did not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even
objected to any spirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock."These
two friends journeyed together to Havre, where, on September 1st, the
way-worn man begins his homeward voyage.Poor Rickman, the perpetually
prosecuted, strains his eyes till the sail is lost, then sits on the
beach and writes his poetical tribute to Jefferson and America for
recalling Paine, and a touching farewell to his friend:

     "Thus smooth be thy waves, and thus gentle the breeze,
     As thou bearest my Paine far away;
     O waft him to comfort and regions of ease,
     Each blessing of freedom and friendship to seize,
     And bright be his setting sun's ray."Who can imagine the joy of those eyes when they once more beheld the
distant coast of the New World!Fifteen years have passed,--years
in which all nightmares became real, and liberty's sun had turned to
blood,--since he saw the happy land fading behind him.Oh, America,
thine old friend who first claimed thy republican independence, who laid
aside his Quaker coat and fought for thy cause, believing it sacred, is
returning to thy breast!This is the man of whom Washington wrote: "His
writings certainly had a powerful effect on the public mind,--ought they
not then to meet an adequate return?It is
not money he needs now, but tenderness, sympathy; for he comes back from
an old world that has plundered, outlawed, imprisoned him for his love
of mankind.He has seen his dear friends sent to the guillotine, and
others are pining in British prisons for publishing his "Rights of
Man,"--principles pronounced by President Jefferson and Secretary
Madison to be those of the United States.Heartsore, scarred,
white-haired, there remains to this veteran of many struggles for
humanity but one hope, a kindly welcome, a peaceful haven for his
tempest-tossed life.Never for an instant has his faith in the heart
of America been shaken.Already he sees his friend Jefferson's arms
extended; he sees his old comrades welcoming him to their hearths; he
sees his own house and sward at Bordentown, and the beautiful Kirk-bride
mansion beside the Delaware,--river of sacred memories, soon to be
spanned by his graceful arch.How the ladies he left girls,--Fanny.Kitty, Sally,--will come with their husbands to greet him!How will they
admire the latest bridge-model, with Lady Smith's delicate chain-work
for which (such is his estimate of friendship) he refused three thousand
pounds, though it would have made his mean room palatial!Ah, yes, poor
heart, America will soothe your wounds, and pillow your sinking head on
her breast!America, with Jefferson in power, is herself again.They do
not hate men in America for not believing in a celestial Robespierre.Thou stricken friend of man, who hast appealed from the god of wrath
to the God of Humanity, see in the distance that Maryland coast, which
early voyagers called Avalon, and sing again your song when first
stepping on that shore twenty-seven years ago:

      "I come to sing that summer is at hand,
      The summer time of wit, you 'll understand;
      Plants, fruits, and flowers, and all the smiling race
      That can the orchard or the garden grace;
      The Rose and Lily shall address the fair,
      And whisper sweetly out, 'My dears, take care:'
      With sterling worth the Plant of Sense shall rise,
      And teach the curious to philosophize.We 'll garnish out the scenes
      With stately rows of Evergreens,
      Trees that will bear the frost, and deck their tops
      With everlasting flowers, like diamond drops."* "The Snowdrop and Critic," Pennsylvania Magazine, 1775.THE AMERICAN INQUISITION

On October 30th Paine landed at Baltimore.More than two and a half
centuries had elapsed since the Catholic Lord Baltimore appointed a
Protestant Governor of Maryland, William Stone, who proclaimed in that
province (1648) religious freedom and equality.The Puritans, crowding
thither, from regions of oppression, grew strong enough to exterminate
the religion of Lord Baltimore who had given them shelter, and
imprisoned his Protestant Governor.So, in the New World, passed the
Inquisition from Catholic to Protestant hands.In Paine's first American pamphlet, he had repeated and extolled the
principle of that earliest proclamation of religious liberty."Diversity
of religious opinions affords a larger field for Christian kindness."The Christian kindness now consists in a cessation of sectarian strife
that they may unite in stretching the author of the "Age of Reason"
on their common rack, so far as was possible under a Constitution
acknowledging no deity.Soon after landing Paine wrote to President Jefferson:

"I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days.I have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get
them from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown
I shall set off to pay my respects to you.Your much obliged
fellow-citizen,--Thomas Paine."On reaching Washington City Paine found his dear friend Monroe starting
off to resume his ministry in Paris, and by him wrote to Mr.Este,
banker in Paris (Sir Robert Smith's son-in-law), enclosing a letter to
Rickman, in London."You can have no idea," he tells Rickman, "of the
agitation which my arrival occasioned."Every paper is "filled with
applause or abuse.""My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and
is now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will
bring me L400 sterling a year.Remember me in friendship and affection
to your wife and family, and in the circle of our friends.I am but just
arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that I have just
time to write you this.If he should not sail this tide I will write to
my good friend Col.Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait on
him for me.* Paine still had faith in Bosville.He was slow in
     suspecting any man who seemed enthusiastic for liberty.In
     this connection it may be mentioned that it is painful to
     find in the "Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris," (ii.,
     p.426) a confidential letter to Robert R. Livingston,
     Minister in France, which seems to assume that Minister's
     readiness to receive slanders of Jefferson, who appointed
     him, and of Paine whose friendship he seemed to value.Speaking of the President, Morris says: "The employment of
     and confidence in adventurers from abroad will sooner or
     later rouse the pride and indignation of this country."Morris' editor adds: "This was probably an allusion to
     Thomas Paine, who had recently returned to America and was
     supposed to be an intimate friend of Mr.Jefferson, who, it
     was said, received him warmly, dined him at the White House,
     and could be seen walking arm in arm with him on the street
     any fine afternoon."The allusion to "adventurers" was no
     doubt meant for Paine, but not to his reception by
     Jefferson, for Morris' letter was written on August 27th,
     some two months before Paine's arrival.It was probably
     meant by Morris to damage Paine in Paris, where it was known
     that he was intimate with Livingston, who had been
     introduced by him to influential men, among others to Sir
     Robert Smith and Este, bankers.It is to be hoped that
     Livingston resented Morris' assumption of his treacherous
     character.Morris, who had shortly before dined at the White
     House, tells Livingston that Jefferson is "descending to a
     condition which I find no decent word to designate."Surely
     Livingston's descendants should discover his reply to that
     letter.The defeated Federalists had already prepared their batteries to assail
the President for inviting Paine to return on a national ship, under
escort of a Congressman.It required some skill for these adherents of
John Adams, a Unitarian, to set the Inquisition in motion.It had to be
done, however, as there was no chance of breaking down Jefferson but
by getting preachers to sink political differences and hound the
President's favorite author.Out of the North, stronghold of the
"British Party," came this partisan crusade under a pious flag.In
Virginia and the South the "Age of Reason" was fairly discussed, its
influence being so great that Patrick Henry, as we have seen, wrote and
burnt a reply.In Virginia, Deism, though largely prevailing, had not
prevented its adherents from supporting the Church as an institution.It had become their habit to talk of such matters only in private.Jefferson had not ventured to express his views in public, and was
troubled at finding himself mixed up with the heresies of Paine.*

     * To the Rev.Waterhouse (Unitarian) who had asked
     permission to publish a letter of his, Jefferson, with a
     keen remembrance of Paine's fate, wrote (July 19, 1822):
     "No, my dear Sir, not for the world.Into what a hornet's
     nest would it thrust my head!--The genus irritabile vatmm,
     on whom argument is lost, and reason is by themselves
     disdained in matters of religion.Don Quixote undertook to
     redress the bodily wrongs of the world, but the redressaient
     of mental vagaries would be an enterprise more than Quixotic
     I should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of
     Bedlam to sound understanding as to inculcate reason into
     that of an Athanasian.I am old, and tranquillity is now my
     summum bonum.Keep me therefore from the fire and <DW19> of
     Calvin and his victim Servetus.Happy in the prospect of a
     restoration of a primitive Christianity, I must leave to
     younger athletes to lop off the false branches which have
     been engrafted into it by the mycologists of the middle and
     modern ages."--MS.The author on reaching Lovell's Hotel, Washington, had made known
his arrival to the President, and was cordially received; but as the
newspapers came in with their abuse, Jefferson may have been somewhat
intimidated.Eager to disembarrass the
administration, Paine published a letter in the _National Intelligencer_
which had cordially welcomed him, in which he said that he should not
ask or accept any office.*

     * The National Intelligencer (Nov.3d), announcing Paine's
     arrival at Baltimore, said, among other things: "Be his
     religious sentiments what they may, it must be their [the
     American people's] wish that he may live in the undisturbed
     possession of our common blessings, and enjoy them the more
     from his active participation in their attainment."The same
     paper said, Nov.10th: "Thomas Paine has arrived in this
     city [Washington] and has received a cordial reception from
     the Whigs of Seventy-six, and the republicans of 1800, who
     have the independence to feel and avow a sentiment of
     gratitude for his eminent revolutionary services."He meant to continue writing and bring forward his mechanical projects.None the less did the "federalist" press use Paine's infidelity to
belabor the President, and the author had to write defensive letters
from the moment of his arrival.On October 29th, before Paine had
landed, the _National Intelligencer_ had printed (from a Lancaster,
Pa., journal) a vigorous letter, signed "A Republican," showing that the
denunciations of Paine were not religious, but political, as John Adams
was also unorthodox.The "federalists" must often have wished that they
had taken this warning, for Paine's pen was keener than ever, and the
opposition had no writer to meet him.His eight "Letters to the
Citizens of the United States" were scathing, eloquent, untrammelled by
partisanship, and made a profound impression on the country,--for even
the opposition press had to publish them as part of the news of the
day.*

     * They were published in the National Intelligencer of
     November 15th, 22d.29th, December 6th, January 25th, and
     February 2d, 1803.Of the others one appeared in the Aurora
     (Philadelphia), dated from Bordentown, N. J., March 12th,
     and the last in the Trenton True American % dated April
     21st.On Christmas Day Paine wrote the President a suggestion for the purchase
of Louisiana.The French, to whom Louisiana had been ceded by Spain,
closed New Orleans (November 26th) against foreign ships (including
American), and prohibited deposits there by way of the Mississippi.This
caused much excitement, and the "federalists" showed eagerness to push
the administration into a belligerent attitude toward France.Paines
"common sense" again came to the front, and he sent Jefferson the
following paper:

"OF LOUISIANA."Spain has ceded Louisiana to france, and france has excluded the
Americans from N. Orleans and the navigation of the Mississippi;
the people of the Western Territory have complained of it to their
Government, and the governt.is of consequence involved and interested
in the affair The question then is--What is the best step to be taken?"The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction
of a right.The other is by accommodation, still keeping the right in
view, but not making it a groundwork."Suppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to france to
repurchase the cession, made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it
be with the consent of the people of Louisiana or a majority thereof."By beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the
appearance of a threat,--the growing power of the western territory
can be stated as matter of information, and also the impossibility
of restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal
impossibility of france to prevent it."Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
carpet This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the
value of the Commerce, and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will
produce."The french treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed
by anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue.A monied
proposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon
france can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be
paid here to the claimants.

"------I congratulate you on the _birthday of the New Sun_, now called
christmas-day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana."Jefferson next day told Paine, what was as yet a profound secret, that
he was already contemplating the purchase of Louisiana.*

     * "The idea occurred to me," Paine afterwards wrote to the
     President, "without knowing it had occurred to any other
     person, and I mentioned it to Dr.Leib who lived in the same
     house (Lovell's); and, as he appeared pleased with it, I
     wrote the note and showed it to him before I sent it.The
     next morning you said to me that measures were already taken
     in that business.When Leib returned from Congress I told
     him of it.'Why then,' said I, 'did
     you not tell me so, because in that case I would not have
     sent the note.''That is the very reason,' said he; 'I would
     not tell you, because two opinions concurring on a case
     strengthen it.'Leib's motion
     about Banks.Congress ought to be very cautious how it gives
     encouragement to this speculating project of banking, for it
     is now carried to an extreme.It is but another kind of
     striking paper money.Neither do I like the notion
     respecting the recession of the territory [District of
     Columbia.]."Michael Leib was a representative from
     Pennsylvania.{1803}

The "New Sun" was destined to bring his sunstrokes on Paine.The
pathetic story of his wrongs in England, his martyrdom in France,
was not generally known, and, in reply to attacks, he had to tell
it himself.He had returned for repose and found himself a sort of
battlefield.One of the most humiliating circumstances was the discovery
that in this conflict of parties the merits of his religion were of
least consideration.The outcry of the country against him, so far as
it was not merely political, was the mere ignorant echo of pulpit
vituperation.His well-considered theism, fruit of so much thought,
nursed amid glooms of the dungeon, was called infidelity or atheism.Even some from whom he might have expected discriminating criticism
accepted the vulgar version and wrote him in deprecation of a work
they had not read.Samuel Adams, his old friend, caught in this
_schwarmerei_, wrote him from Boston (November 30th) that he had "heard"
that he had "turned his mind to a defence of infidelity."Paine copied
for him his creed from the "Age of Reason," and asked, "My good friend,
do you call believing in God infidelity?"This letter to Samuel Adams (January 1, 1803) has indications that Paine
had developed farther his theistic ideal."We cannot serve the Deity in the manner we serve those who cannot do
without that service.We can add nothing to
eternity.But it is in our power to render a service acceptable to him,
and that is, not by praying, but by endeavoring to make his creatures
happy.A man does not serve God by praying, for it is himself he is
trying to serve; and as to hiring or paying men to pray, as if the Deity
needed instruction, it is in my opinion an abomination.I have been
exposed to and preserved through many dangers, but instead of buffeting
the Deity with prayers, as if I distrusted him, or must dictate to him,
I reposed myself on his protection; and you, my friend, will find, even
in your last moments, more consolation in the silence of resignation
than in the murmuring wish of a prayer."Paine must have been especially hurt by a sentence in the letter of
Samuel Adams in which he said: "Our friend, the president of the United
States, has been calumniated for his liberal sentiments, by men who have
attributed that liberality to a latent design to promote the cause of
infidelity."To this he did not reply, but it probably led him to feel a
deeper disappointment at the postponement of the interviews he had hoped
to enjoy with Jefferson after thirteen years of separation.A feeling
of this kind no doubt prompted the following note (January 12th) sent to
the President:

"I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up
to set off for Philadelphia and New York.My intention in bringing them
here in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was
to have some conversation with you on those matters and others I have
not informed you of.But you have not only shown no disposition towards
it, but have, in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in
fear of federal observation, precluded it.I am not the only one, who
makes observations of this kind."Jefferson at once took care that there should be no misunderstanding
as to his regard for Paine.The author was for some days a guest in the
President's family, where he again met Maria Jefferson (Mrs.Eppes) whom
he had known in Paris.Randall says the devout ladies of the family had
been shy of Paine, as was but natural, on account of the President's
reputation for rationalism, but "Paine's discourse was weighty, his
manners sober and inoffensive; and he left Mr.Jefferson's mansion the
subject of lighter prejudices than he entered it."*

     * "Life of Jefferson," ii., 642 sec.Randall is mistaken in
     some statements.Paine, as we have seen, did not return on
     the ship placed at his service by the President; nor did
     the President's letter appear until long after his return,
     when he and Jefferson felt it necessary in order to disabuse
     the public mind of the most absurd rumors on the subject.Paine's defamers have manifested an eagerness to ascribe his
maltreatment to personal faults.For some years
after his arrival in the country no one ventured to hint anything
disparaging to his personal habits or sobriety.On January 1, 1803, he
wrote to Samuel Adams: "I have a good state of health and a happy mind;
I take care of both by nourishing the first with temperance, and the
latter with abundance."Had not this been true the "federal" press would have noised it abroad.In all portraits, French and American, his
dress is in accordance with the fashion.There was not, so far as I can
discover, a suggestion while he was at Washington, that he was not a
suitable guest for any drawing-room in the capital On February 23,
1803, probably, was written the following which I find among the Cobbett
papers:

From Mr.Jefferson, on the occasion of a toast being given
at a federal dinner at Washington, of "May they

     NEVER KNOW PLEASURE WHO LOVE PAINE.""I send you, Sir, a tale about some Feds,
     Who, in their wisdom, got to loggerheads.The case was this, they felt so flat and sunk,
     They took a glass together and got drunk.Such things, you know, are neither new nor rare,
     For some will hary themselves when in despair.It was the natal day of Washington,
     And that they thought a famous day for fun;
     For with the learned world it is agreed,
     The better day the better deed.They talked away, and as the glass went round
     They grew, in point of wisdom, more profound;
     For at the bottom of the bottle lies
     That kind of sense we overlook when wise.Come, here's a toast, cried one, with roar immense,
     May none know pleasure who love Common Sense.some others cried,
     But left it to the waiter to decide.I think, said he, the case would be more plain,
     To leave out Common Sense, and put in Paine.On this a mighty noise arose among
     This drunken, bawling, senseless throng.Some said that Common Sense was all a curse,
     That making people wiser made them worse;
     It learned them to be careful of their purse,
     And not be laid about like babes at nurse,
     Nor yet believe in stories upon trust,
     Which all mankind, to be well governed must;
     And that the toast was better at the first,
     And he that didn't think so might be cursed.So on they went, till such a fray arose
     As all who know what Feds are may suppose."On his way northward, to his old home in Bor-dentown, Paine passed many
a remembered spot, but found little or no greeting on his journey.In
Baltimore a "New Jerusalemite," as the Sweden-borgian was then called,
the Rev.Hargrove, accosted him with the information that the key to
scripture was found, after being lost 4,000 years."Then it must be very rusty," answered Paine."His principles," wrote
Rush to Cheetham, "avowed in his 'Age of Reason,' were so offensive to
me that I did not wish to renew my intercourse with him."Paine made
arrangements for the reception of his bridge models at Peale's Museum,
but if he met any old friend there no mention of it appears.Most
of those who had made up the old circle--Franklin, Rittenhouse,
Muhlenberg--were dead, some were away in Congress; but no doubt Paine
saw George Clymer.However, he did not stay long in Philadelphia, for he
was eager to reach the spot he always regarded as his home, Bordentown.And there, indeed, his hope, for a time, seemed to be fulfilled It need
hardly be said that his old friend Colonel Kirkbride gave him hearty
welcome.John Hall, Paine's bridge mechanician, "never saw him jollier,"
and he was full of mechanical "whims and schemes" they were to pursue
together.Jefferson was candidate for the presidency, and Paine entered
heartily into the canvass; which was not prudent, but he knew nothing of
prudence.The issue not only concerned an old friend, but was turning on
the question of peace with France.On March 12th he writes against the
"federalist" scheme for violently seizing New Orleans.At a meeting in
April, over which Colonel Kirkbride presides, Paine drafts a reply to an
attack on Jefferson's administration, circulated in New York.On April
21 st he writes the refutation of an attack on Jefferson, _apropos_ of
the national vessel offered for his return, which had been coupled
with a charge that Paine had proposed to the Directory an invasion of
America!In June he writes about his bridge models (then at Peale's
Museum, Philadelphia), and his hope to span the Delaware and the
Schuylkill with iron arches.Here is a letter written to Jefferson from Bordentown

(August 2d) containing suggestions concerning the beginning of
government in Louisiana, from which it would appear that Paine's faith
in the natural inspiration of _vox populi_ was still imperfect:

"I take it for granted that the present inhabitants know little or
nothing of election and representation as constituting government.They
are therefore not in an immediate condition to exercise those powers,
and besides this they are perhaps too much under the influence of their
priests to be sufficiently free."I should suppose that a Government _provisoire_ formed by Congress for
three, five, or seven years would be the best mode of beginning.In
the meantime they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
Municipal government, and after some experience they will be in train to
elect their State government.I think it would not only be good policy
but right to say, that the people shall have the right of electing their
Church Ministers, otherwise their Ministers will hold by authority from
the Pope.I do not make it a compulsive article, but to put it in their
power to use it when they please.It will serve to hold the priests in a
stile of good behavior, and also to give the people an idea of elective
rights.Anything, they say, will do to learn upon, and therefore they
may as well begin upon priests."The present prevailing language is french and Spanish, but it will be
necessary to establish schools to teach english as the laws ought to be
in the language of the Union."As soon as you have formed any plan for settling the Lands I shall be
glad to know it.My motive for this is because there are thousands and
tens of thousands in England and Ireland and also in Scotland who are
friends of mine by principle, and who would gladly change their present
country and condition.Many among them, for I have friends in all ranks
of life in those countries, are capable of becoming monied purchasers to
any amount."If you can give me any hints respecting Louisiana, the quantity in
square miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will
find an opportunity of making some use of it.When the formalities of
the cession are compleated, the next thing will be to take possession,
and I think it would be very consistent for the President of the United
States to do this in person."What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for?Is he there as an Agent for the
British as Blount was said to be?"Of the same date is a letter to Senator Breck-enridge, of Kentucky,
forwarded through Jefferson:

"My Dear Friend,--Not knowing your place of Residence in Kentucky I send
this under cover to the President desiring him to fill up the direction."I see by the public papers and the Proclamation for calling Congress,
that the cession of Louisiana has been obtained.The papers state the
purchase to be 11,250,000 dollars in the six per cents and 3,750,000
dollars to be paid to American claimants who have furnished supplies to
France and the french Colonies and are yet unpaid, making on the whole
15,000,000 dollars."I observe that the faction of the Feds who last Winter were for going
to war to obtain possession of that country and who attached so much
importance to it that no expense or risk ought be spared to obtain it,
have now altered their tone and say it is not worth having, and that
we are better without it than with it."The second section of the 2d article of the constitution says, The
'President shall have Power by and with the consent of the senate to
make Treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur.'"A question may be supposed to arise on the present case, which is,
under what character is the cession to be considered and taken up in
congress, whether as a treaty, or in some other shape?"Though the word, Treaty, as a Word, is unlimited in its meaning
and application, it must be supposed to have a denned meaning in the
constitution.It there means Treaties of alliance or of navigation and
commerce--Things which require a more profound deliberation than
common acts do, because they entail on the parties a future reciprocal
responsibility and become afterwards a supreme law on each of the
contracting countries which neither can annull.But the cession of
Louisiana to the United States has none of these features in it It is a
sale and purchase.A sole act which when finished, the parties have no
more to do with each other than other buyers and sellers have.It has no
future reciprocal consequences (which is one of the marked characters of
a Treaty) annexed to it; and the idea of its becoming a supreme law
to the parties reciprocally (which is another of the characters of a
Treaty) is inapplicable in the present case.There remains nothing for
such a law to act upon."I love the restriction in the constitution which takes from the
Executive the power of making treaties of his own will: and also the
clause which requires the consent of two thirds of the Senators, because
we cannot be too cautious in involving and entangling ourselves with
foreign powers; but I have an equal objection against extending the
same power to the senate in cases to which it is not strictly and
constitutionally applicable, because it is giving a nullifying power
to a minority.Treaties, as already observed, are to have future
consequences and whilst they remain, remain always in execution
externally as well as internally, and therefore it is better to run the
risk of losing a good treaty for the want of two thirds of the senate
than be exposed to the danger of ratifying a bad one by a small
majority.But in the present case no operation is to follow but what
acts itself within our own Territory and under our own laws.We are the
sole power concerned after the cession is accepted and the money paid,
and therefore the cession is not a Treaty in the constitutional meaning
of the word subject to be rejected by a minority in the senate."The question whether the cession shall be accepted and the bargain
closed by a grant of money for the purpose, (which I take to be the
sole question) is a case equally open to both houses of congress, and
if there is any distinction of _formal right_, it ought according to
the constitution, as a money transaction, to begin in the house of
Representatives."I suggest these matters that the senate may not be taken unawares, for
I think it not improbable that some Fed, who intends to negative the
cession, will move to take it up as if it were a Treaty of Alliance or
of Navigation and Commerce."The object here is an increase of territory for a valuable
consideration.It is altogether a home concern--a matter of domestic
policy.The only real ratification is the payment of the money, and as
all verbal ratification without this goes for nothing, it would be a
waste of time and expense to debate on the verbal ratification distinct
from the money ratification.The shortest way, as it appears to me,
would be to appoint a committee to bring in a report on the President's
Message, and for that committee to report a bill for the payment of the
money.The french Government, as the seller of the property, will not
consider anything ratification but the payment of the money contracted
for."There is also another point, necessary to be aware of, which is, to
accept it in toto.Any alteration or modification in it, or annexed as
a condition is so far fatal, that it puts it in the power of the other
party to reject the whole and propose new Terms.There can be no such
thing as ratifying in part, or with a condition annexed to it and
the ratification to be binding.It is still a continuance of the
negociation."It ought to be presumed that the American ministers have done to the
best of their power and procured the best possible terms, and that being
immediately on the spot with the other party they were better Judges of
the whole, and of what could, or could not be done, than any person at
this distance, and unacquainted with many of the circumstances of the
case, can possibly be."If a treaty, a contract, or a cession be good upon the whole, it is ill
policy to hazard the whole, by an experiment to get some trifle in it
altered.The right way of proceeding in such case is to make sure of
the whole by ratifying it, and then instruct the minister to propose
a clause to be added to the Instrument to obtain the amendment or
alteration wished for.This was the method Congress took with respect to
the Treaty of Commerce with France in 1778.Congress ratified the whole
and proposed two new articles which were agreed to by France and added
to the Treaty."There is according to newspaper account an article which admits french
and Spanish vessels on the same terms as American vessels.But this
does not make it a commercial Treaty.It is only one of the Items in the
payment: and it has this advantage, that it joins Spain with France in
making the cession and is an encouragement to commerce and new settlers."With respect to the purchase, admitting it to be 15 millions dollars,
it is an advantageous purchase.The revenue alone purchased as an
annuity or rent roll is worth more--at present I suppose the revenue
will pay five per cent for the purchase money."I know not if these observations will be of any use to you.I am in
a retired village and out of the way of hearing the talk of the great
world.But I see that the Feds, at least some of them, are changing
their tone and now reprobating the acquisition of Louisiana; and the
only way they can take to lose the affair will be to take it up as they
would a Treaty of Commerce and annull it by a Minority; or entangle it
with some condition that will render the ratification of no effect."I believe in this state (Jersey) we shall have a majority at the next
election.I have half a
disposition to visit the Western World next spring and go on to New
Orleans.They are a new people and unacquainted with the principles of
representative government and I think I could do some good among them."As the stage-boat which was to take this letter to the Post-office does
not depart till to-morrow, I amuse myself with continuing the subject
after I had intended to close it."I know little and can learn but little of the extent and present
population of Louisiana.After the cession be com-pleated and the
territory annexed to the United States it will, I suppose, be formed
into states, one, at least, to begin with."The people, as I have said, are new to us and we to them and a great
deal will depend on a right beginning.As they have been transferred
backward and forward several times from one European Government to
another it is natural to conclude they have no fixed prejudices with
respect to foreign attachments, and this puts them in a fit disposition
for their new condition.The established religion is roman; but in
what state it is as to exterior ceremonies (such as processions and
celebrations), I know not.Had the cession to france continued with her,
religion I suppose would have been put on the same footing as it is
in that country, and there no ceremonial of religion can appear on the
streets or highways; and the same regulation is particularly necessary
now or there will soon be quarrels and tumults between the old settlers
and the new.The Yankees will not move out of the road for a little
wooden Jesus stuck on a stick and carried in procession nor kneel in
the dirt to a wooden Virgin Mary.As we do not govern the territory as
provinces but incorporated as states, religion there must be on the same
footing it is here, and Catholics have the same rights as Catholics have
with us and no others.As to political condition the Idea proper to be
held out is, that we have neither conquered them, nor bought them, but
formed a Union with them and they become in consequence of that union a
part of the national sovereignty."The present Inhabitants and their descendants will be a majority for
some time, but new emigrations from the old states and from Europe, and
intermarriages, will soon change the first face of things, and it is
necessary to have this in mind when the first measures shall be taken.Everything done as an expedient grows worse every day, for in proportion
as the mind grows up to the full standard of sight it disclaims the
expedient.America had nearly been ruined by expedients in the first
stages of the revolution, and perhaps would have been so, had not
'Common Sense' broken the charm and the Declaration of Independence sent
it into banishment."Yours in friendship

"Thomas Paine.*

"remember me in the circle of your friends."William F.
     Havermeyer, Jr.E. M. Woodward, in his account of Bordentown, mentions among the
"traditions" of the place, that Paine used to meet a large number of
gentlemen at the "Washington House," kept by Debora Applegate, where he
conversed freely "with any proper person who approached him."Paine was too much occupied in literary pursuits and writing to
spend a great deal of his time here, but he generally paid several
visits during the day.In walking he
was generally absorbed in deep thought, seldom noticed any one as he
passed, unless spoken to, and in going from his home to the tavern was
frequently observed to cross the street several times.It is stated that
several members of the church were turned from their faith by him, and
on this account, and the general feeling of the community against him
for his opinions on religious subjects, he was by the mass of the
people held in odium, which feeling to some extent was extended to Col.These "traditions" were recorded in 1876.Paine's "great power of
conversation" was remembered.But among the traditions, even of the
religious, there is none of any excess in drinking.Possibly the turning of several church-members from their faith may
not have been so much due to Paine as to the parsons, in showing their
"religion" as a gorgon turning hearts to stone against a benefactor
of mankind.One day Paine went with Colonel Kirkbride to visit Samuel
Rogers, the Colonels brother-in-law, at Bellevue, across the river.As
he entered the door Rogers turned his back, refusing his old friend's
hand, because it had written the "Age of Reason."Presently Borden-town
was placarded with pictures of the Devil flying away with Paine.The
pulpits set up a chorus of vituperation.Why should the victim spare the
altar on which he is sacrificed, and justice also?Dogma had chosen to
grapple with the old man in its own way.That it was able to break a
driven leaf Paine could admit as truly as Job; but he could as bravely
say: Withdraw thy hand from me, and I will answer thee, or thou shalt
answer me!In Paine too it will be proved that such outrages on truth
and friendship, on the rights of thought, proceed from no God, but from
the destructive forces once personified as the adversary of man.Early in March Paine visited New York, to see Monroe before his
departure for France.He drove with Kirkbride to Trenton; but so furious
was the pious mob, he was refused a seat in the Trenton stage.They
dined at Government House, but when starting for Brunswick were hooted
These were the people for whose liberties Paine had marched that same
road on foot, musket in hand.At Trenton insults were heaped on the
man who by camp-fires had written the _Crisis_, which animated the
conquerors of the Hessians at that place, in "the times that tried men's
souls."These people he helped to make free,--free to cry _Crucify!_

Paine had just written to Jefferson that the Louisianians were "perhaps
too much under the influence of their priests to be sufficiently free."Probably the same thought occurred to him about people nearer home,
when he presently heard of Colonel Kirkbride's sudden unpopularity, and
death.On October 3d Paine lost this faithful friend.*

     * It should be stated that Burlington County, in which
     Bordentown is situated, was preponderantly Federalist, and
     that Trenton was in the hands of a Federalist mob of young
     well-to-do rowdies.The editor of the _True American_, a
     Republican paper to which Paine had contributed, having
     commented on a Fourth of July orgie of those rowdies in a
     house associated with the revolution, was set upon with
     bludgeons on July 12th, and suffered serious injuries.The
     Grand Jury refused to present the Federalist ruffians,
     though the evidence was clear, and the mob had free course.The facts of the Paine mob are these: after dining at Government House,
Trenton, Kirkbride applied for a seat on the New York stage for Paine.The owner, Voorhis, cursed Paine as "a deist," and said, "I 'll be
damned if he shall go in my stage."Another stage-owner also refused,
saying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don't
want them to suffer again."When Paine and Kirkbride had entered their
carriage a mob surrounded them with a drum, playing the "rogue's march."The local reporter (_True American_) says, "Mr.Paine discovered not the
least emotion of fear or anger, but calmly observed that such conduct
had no tendency to hurt his feelings or injure his fame."The mob then
tried to frighten the horse with the drum, and succeeded, but the two
gentlemen reached a friend's house in Brunswick in safety.A letter
from Trenton had been written to the stage-master there also, to prevent
Paine from securing a seat, whether with success does not appear.NEW ROCHELLE AND THE BONNEVILLES

The Bonnevilles, with whom Paine had resided in Paris, were completely
impoverished after his departure.They resolved to follow Paine to
America, depending on his promise of aid should they do so.Foreseeing
perils in France, Nicolas, unable himself to leave at once, hurried off
his wife and children--Benjamin, Thomas, and Louis.Madame Bonneville
would appear to have arrived in August, 1803.I infer this because Paine
writes, September 23d, to Jefferson from Stonington, Connecticut; and
later letters show that he had been in New York, and afterwards placed
Thomas Paine Bonneville with the Rev.Foster (Universalist) of
Stonington for education.Madame Bonneville was placed in his house at
Bordentown, where she was to teach French.At New York, Paine found both religious and political parties sharply
divided over him.At Lovett's Hotel, where he stopped, a large dinner
was given him, March 18th, seventy being present One of the active
promoters of this dinner was James Cheetham, editor of the _American
Citizen_, who, after seriously injuring Paine by his patronage, became
his malignant enemy.In the summer of 1803 the political atmosphere was in a tempestuous
condition, owing to the widespread accusation that Aaron Burr had
intrigued with the Federalists against Jefferson to gain the presidency.There was a Society in New York called "Republican Greens," who, on
Independence Day, had for a toast "Thomas Paine, the Man of the People,"
and who seem to have had a piece of music called the "Rights of Man."Paine was also apparently the hero of that day at White Plains, where
a vast crowd assembled, "over 1,000," among the toasts being: "Thomas
Paine--the bold advocate of rational liberty--the People's friend."He
probably reached New York again in August A letter for "Thomas Payne"
is in the advertised Letter-list of August 6th, and in the _American
Citizen_ (August 9th) are printed (and misprinted) "Lines, extempore, by
Thomas Paine, July, 1803."*

     * On July 12th the _Evening Post _(edited by William
     Coleman) tries to unite republicanism and infidelity by
     stating that Part I. of the "Age of Reason" was sent in MS.Fellows of New York, and in the following year Part
     II.was gratuitously distributed "from what is now the
     office of the Aurora."On September 24th that paper
     publishes a poem about Paine, ending:


     "Quick as the lightning's vivid flash
     The poet's eye o'er Europe rolls;
     Sees battles rage, hears tempests crash,
     And dims at horror's threatening scowls."Mark ambition's ruthless king,
     With crimsoned banners scathe the globe;
     While trailing after conquest's wing,
     Man's festering wounds his demons probe."Palled with streams of reeking gore
     That stain the proud imperial day,
     He turns to view the western shore,
     Where freedom holds her boundless sway."'T is here her sage triumphant sways
     An empire in the people's love;
     'T is here the sovereign will obeys
     No king but Him who rules above."The verses, crudely expressing the contrast between President Jefferson
and King George--or Napoleon, it is not clear which,--sufficiently show
that Paine's genius was not extempore.His reputation as a patriotic
minstrel was high; his "Hail, great Republic," to the tune of "Rule
Britannia," was the established Fourth-of-July song, and it was even
sung at the dinner of the American consul in London (Erving) March 4,
1803, the anniversary of Jefferson's election.Possibly the extempore
lines were sung on some Fourth-of-July occasion.I find "Thomas Paine"
and the "Rights of Man" favorite toasts at republican celebrations in
Virginia also at this time.In New York we may discover Paine's coming
and going by rancorous paragraphs concerning him in the _Evening Post_.*

     "And having spent a lengthy life in evil,
     Return again unto thy parent Devil!"Perhaps the most malignant wrong done Paine in this paper was the
adoption of his signature, "Common Sense," by one of its contributors!Another paragraph says that Franklin hired Paine in London to come to
America and write in favor of the Revolution,--a remarkable example of
federalist heredity from "Toryism."On September 27th the paper prints a
letter purporting to have been found by a waiter in Lovett's Hotel after
Paine's departure,--a long letter to Paine, by some red-revolutionary
friend, of course gloating over the exquisite horrors filling Europe in
consequence of the "Rights of Man."12, 1803," and signed "J.The paper's correspondent pretends
to have found out Oldney, and conversed with him.No doubt many simple
people believed the whole thing genuine.The most learned physician in New York, Dr.Nicholas Romayne, invited
Paine to dinner, where he was met by John Pintard, and other eminent
citizens.Pintard said to Paine: "I have read and re-read your 'Age
of Reason,' and any doubts which I before entertained of the truth
of revelation have been removed by your logic.Yes, sir, your very
arguments against Christianity have convinced me of its truth.""Well
then," answered Paine, "I may return to my couch to-night with the
consolation that I have made at least one Christian."* This authentic
anecdote is significant John Pintard, thus outdone by Paine in
politeness, founded the Tammany Society, and organized the democratic
party.When the "Rights of Man" appeared, the book and its author were
the main toasts of the Tammany celebrations; but it was not so after
the "Age of Reason" had appeared.For John Pintard was all his life
a devotee of Dutch Reformed orthodoxy.Tammany, having begun with the
populace, had by this time got up somewhat in society.As a rule the
"gentry" were Federalists, though they kept a mob in their back yard to
fly at the democrats on occasion.But with Jefferson in the presidential
chair, and Clinton vice-president, Tammany was in power.To hold this
power Tammany had to court the clergy.So there was no toast to Paine in
the Wigwam of 1803.Francis' "Old New York," p.** The New York Daily Advertiser published the whole of Part
     I. of the "Rights of Man" in 1791 (May 6-27), the editor
     being then John Pintard.At the end of the publication a
     poetical tribute to Paine was printed.Four of the lines run:

     "Rous'd by the reason of his manly page,
     Once more shall Paine a listening world engage;
     From reason's source a bold reform he brings,
     By raising up mankind he pulls down kings."President Jefferson was very anxious about the constitutional points
involved in his purchase of Louisiana, and solicited Paine's views on
the whole subject.Paine wrote to him extended communications, among
which was the letter of September 23d, from Stonington.The interest of
the subject is now hardly sufficient to warrant publication of the whole
of this letter, which, however, possesses much interest.At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the third Centenary of
the discovery of America, by the sons of St Tammany, New York, the first
man toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to Paine "The Rights of
Man."They were also extolled in an ode composed for the occasion, and
sung."Your two favours of the 10 and 18 ult.reached me at this place on the
14th inst.I do not suppose that the framers
of the Constitution thought anything about the acquisition of new
territory, and even if they did it was prudent to say nothing about
it, as it might have suggested to foreign Nations the idea that we
contemplated foreign conquest.It appears to me to be one of those cases
with which the Constitution had nothing to do, and which can be judged
of only by the circumstances of the times when such a case shall occur.The Constitution could not foresee that Spain would cede Louisiana to
France or to England, and therefore it could not determine what our
conduct should be in consequence of such an event.The cession makes
no alteration in the Constitution; it only extends the principles of it
over a larger territory, and this certainly is within the morality of
the Constitution, and not contrary to, nor beyond, the expression or
intention of any of its articles... Were a question to arise it would
apply, not to the Cession, because it violates no article of the
Constitution, but to Ross and Morris's motion.The Constitution empowers
Congress to declare war, but to make war without declaring it is
anti-constitutional.It is like attacking an unarmed man in the dark.There is also another reason why no such question should arise.The
english Government is but in a tottering condition and if Bonaparte
succeeds, that Government will break up.In that case it is not
improbable we may obtain Canada, and I think that Bermuda ought to
belong to the United States.In its present condition it is a nest for
piratical privateers.This is not a subject to be spoken of, but it may
be proper to have it in mind."The latest news we have from Europe in this place is the insurrection
in Dublin.It is a disheartening circumstance to the english Government,
as they are now putting arms into the hands of people who but a few
weeks before they would have hung had they found a pike in their
possession.I think the probability is in favour of the descent [on
England by Bonaparte]...

"I shall be employed the ensuing Winter in cutting two or three thousand
Cords of Wood on my farm at New Rochelle for the New York market distant
twenty miles by water.The Wood is worth 3 1/2 dollars per load as it
stands.This will furnish me with ready money, and I shall then be ready
for whatever may present itself of most importance next spring.I had
intended to build myself a house to my own taste, and a workshop for
my mechanical operations, and make a collection, as authors say, of
my works, which with what I have in manuscript will make four, or five
octavo volumes, and publish them by subscription, but the prospects that
are now opening with respect to England hold me in suspence."It has been customary in a President's discourse to say something about
religion.The word, religion,
used as a word _en masse_ has no application to a country like America.In catholic countries it would mean exclusively the religion of the
romish church; with the Jews, the Jewish religion; in England,
the protestant religion or in the sense of the english church, the
established religion; with the Deists it would mean Deism; with the
Turks, Mahometism &c, &c, As well as I recollect it is _Lego, Religo,
Relegio, Religion_, that is say, tied or bound by an oath or obligation.The french use the word properly; when a woman enters a convent, she is
called a novitiate; when she takes the oath, she is a _religieuse_, that
is, she is bound by an oath.Now all that we have to do, as a Government
with the word religion, in this country, is with the civil rights of it,
and not at all with its _creeds_.Instead therefore of using the word
religion, as a word en masse, as if it meant a creed, it would be better
to speak only of its civil rights; _that all denominations of religion
are equally protected, that none are dominant, none inferior, that
the rights of conscience are equal to every denomination and to every
individual and that it is the duty of Government to preserve this
equality of conscientious rights_.A man cannot be called a hypocrite
for defending the civil rights of religion, but he may be suspected of
insincerity in defending its creeds."I suppose you will find it proper to take notice of the impressment of
American seamen by the Captains of British vessels, and procure a list
of such captains and report them to their government.This pretence
of searching for british seamen is a new pretence for visiting and
searching American vessels....

"I am passing some time at this place at the house of a friend till the
wood cutting time comes on, and I shall engage some cutters here and
then return to New Rochelle.Madison concerning the
report that the british Government had cautioned ours not to pay
the purchase money for Louisiana, as they intended to take it for
themselves.I have received his [negative] answer, and I pray you make
him my compliments."We are still afflicted with the yellow fever, and the Doctors are
disputing whether it is an imported or a domestic disease.Would it not
be a good measure to prohibit the arrival of all vessels from the West
Indies from the last of June to the middle of October.If this was
done this session of Congress, and we escaped the fever next summer, we
should always know how to escape it.I question if performing quarantine
is a sufficient guard.The disease may be in the cargo, especially that
part which is barrelled up, and not in the persons on board, and when
that cargo is opened on our wharfs, the hot steaming air in contact with
the ground imbibes the infection.I can conceive that infected air can
be barrelled up, not in a hogshead of rum, nor perhaps sucre, but in
a barrel of coffee.I am badly off in this place for pen and Ink, and
short of paper.I heard yesterday from Boston that our old friend S.
Adams was at the point of death.When Madame Bonneville left France it was understood that her husband
would soon follow, but he did not come, nor was any letter received from
him.This was probably the most important allusion in a letter of Paine,
dated New York, March 1, 1804, to "Citizen Skipwith, Agent Commercial
d'Amerique, Paris.""Dear Friend--I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who
is on the point of sailing for Bordeaux.The Republican interest is now
compleatly triumphant.The change within this last year has been great.We have now 14 States out of 17,--N. Hampshire, Mass.I much question if any person will be started against Mr.Burr is rejected for the vice-presidency; he is now putting
up for Governor of N. York.Morgan Lewis, Chief Justice of the State of N. Y. is the Republican
candidate for Governor of that State."I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since
I left it.We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe.I have not heard anything from him except that
he is _always_ coming.Not a line has been
received from aim.Madame Bonneville, unable to speak English, found Bordentown dull,
and soon turned up in New York.She ordered rooms in Wilburn's
boarding-house, where Paine was lodging, and the author found the
situation rather complicated The family was absolutely without means
of their own, and Paine, who had given them a comfortable home at
Bordentown, was annoyed by their coming on to New York.Anxiety is shown
in the following letter written at 16 Gold St., New York, March 24th, to
"Mr."Dear Sir,--I received your letter by Mr.Nixon, and also a former
letter, but I have been so unwell this winter with a fit of gout, tho'
not so bad as I had at Bordenton about twenty years ago, that I could
not write, and after I got better I got a fall on the ice in the garden
where I lodge that threw me back for above a month.I was obliged to get
a person to copy off the letter to the people of England, published
in the Aurora, March 7, as I dictated it verbally, for all the time my
complaint continued.My health and spirits were as good as ever.It
was my intention to have cut a large quantity of wood for the New York
market, and in that case you would have had the money directly, but this
accident and the gout prevented my doing anything.I shall now have to
take up some money upon it, which I shall do by the first of May to put
Mrs.Bonneville into business, and I shall then discharge her bill.In
the mean time I wish you to receive a quarter's rent due on the 1st of
April from Mrs Richardson, at $25 per ann., and to call on Mrs.Read for
40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get, and to give a receipt in my name.Kirkbride should have discharged your bill, it was what he engaged
to do.Wharton owes for the rent of the house while she lived in
it, unless Col.Kirkbride has taken it into his accounts.Samuel Hileyar
owes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money.Nixon spake to me about
hiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.Richardson intended to
stay in it or quit it I could give no positive answer, but said I would
write to you about it.Israel Butler also writes me about taking at the
same rent as Richardson pays.I will be obliged to you to let the house
as you may judge best.I shall make a visit to Bordenton in the spring,
and I shall call at your house first."There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England.P. Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte.You will see
it in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the
french legislature.She would have wrote, but she
cannot yet venture to write in English.I congratulate you on your new
appointment."*

     * I am indebted for this letter to the N. Y. Hist.Society,
     which owns the original ought to be fulfilled."The
     following passages may be quoted:

     "In casting my eye over England and America, and comparing
     them together, the difference is very striking.The two
     countries were created by the same power, and peopled from
     the same stock.Have
     those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom they
     left behind degenerated?...We see America flourishing
     in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations, and
     reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the
     revolution.On the contrary we see England almost
     perpetually in war, or warlike disputes, and her debt and
     taxes continually increasing.Could we suppose a stranger,
     who knew nothing of the origin of the two nations, he would
     from observation conclude that America was the old country,
     experienced and sage, and England the new, eccentric and
     wild.Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from
     America, after the revolutionary war, than she was on the
     point of plunging herself into a war with Holland, on
     account of the Stadtholder; then with Russia; then with
     Spain on account of the Nootka cat-skins; and actually with
     France to prevent her revolution.Scarcely had she made
     peace with France, and before she had fulfilled her own part
     of the Treaty, than she declared war again, to avoid
     fulfilling the Treaty.In her Treaty of peace with America,
     she engaged to evacuate the western posts within six months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to fulfil the
     conditions, and kept possession of the posts, and embroiled
     herself in an Indian war.* In her Treaty of peace with
     France, she engaged to evacuate Malta within three months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to evacuate Malta,
     and began a new war."* Paine's case is not quite sound at this point.The
     Americans had not, on their side, fulfilled the condition of
     paying their English debts.(1804)

Paine's letter alluded to was printed in the _Aurora_ with the following
note:

"To the Editor.--As the good sense of the people in their elections has
now put the affairs of America in a prosperous condition at home and
abroad, there is nothing immediately important for the subject of a
letter.I therefore send you a piece on another subject."The piece presently appeared as a pamphlet of sixteen pages with the
following title: "Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion
of England.Philadelphia: Printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch
Street.Once more the hope had risen in Paine's breast that
Napoleon was to turn liberator, and that England was to be set free."If
the invasion succeed I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war
has not been provoked by the people.It is altogether the act of the
government without their consent or knowledge; and though the late
peace appears to have been insidious from the first, on the part of the
government, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy."He still hopes that the English people may be able to end the trouble
peacefully, by compelling Parliament to fulfil the Treaty of Amiens.Paine points out that the failure of the French Revolution was due to
"the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was
the principal and vindictive agent," and affirms the success of
representative government in the United States after thirty years'
trial."The people of England have now two revolutions before them,--the
one as an example, the other as a warning.Their own wisdom will direct
them what to choose and what to avoid; and in everything which regards
their happiness, combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them
honor and success."During this summer, Paine wrote a brilliant paper on a memorial sent
to Congress from the French inhabitants of Louisiana.They demanded
immediate admission to equal Statehood, also the right to continue
the importation of <DW64> slaves.Paine reminds the memorialists of
the "mischief caused in France by the possession of power before they
understood principles."After explaining their position, and the
freedom they have acquired by the merits of others, he points out their
ignorance of human "rights" as shown in their guilty notion that to
enslave others is among them."Dare you put up a petition to Heaven
for such a power, without fearing to be struck from the earth by its
justice?Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?Do you want to
renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?"This article (dated September 22d) produced great effect.John Randolph
of Roanoke, in a letter to Albert Gallatin (October 14th), advises
"the printing of... thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to their
remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many thousand troops, who
can speak a language perfectly intelligible to the people of Louisiana,
whatever that of their governor may be."Nicolas Bonneville still giving no sign, and Madame being uneconomical
in her notions of money, Paine thought it necessary--morally and
financially--to let it be known that he was not responsible for her
debts.When, therefore, Wilburn applied to him for her board ($35),
Paine declined to pay, and was sued.Paine pleaded _non assumpsit_, and,
after gaining the case, paid Wilburn the money.It presently turned out that the surveillance of Nicolas Bonneville did
not permit him to leave France, and, as he was not permitted to resume
his journal or publications, he could neither join his family nor assist
them.Paine now resolved to reside on his farm.It is dated at New Rochelle, July 9th:

"Fellow Citizen,--As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the
people begin to get out of town, you may as well come up here and help
me settle my accounts with the man who lives on the place.You will be
able to do this better than I shall, and in the mean time I can go on
with my literary works, without having my mind taken off by affairs of
a different kind.I have received a packet from Governor Clinton,
enclosing what I wrote for.If you come up by the stage you will stop
at the post-office, and they will direct you the way to the farm.I send a price for the Prospect; if the plan
mentioned in it is pursued, it will open a way to enlarge and give
establishment to the deistical church; but of this and some other things
we will talk when you come up, and the sooner the better.Paine was presently enjoying himself on his farm at New Rochelle, and
Madame Bonneville began to keep house for him."It is a pleasant and healthy situation [he wrote to Jefferson somewhat
later], commanding a prospect always green and peaceable, as New
Rochelle produces a great deal of grass and hay.The farm contains three
hundred acres, about one hundred of which is meadow land, one hundred
grazing and village land, and the remainder woodland.It is an oblong
about a mile and a half in length.I have sold off sixty-one acres and
a half for four thousand and twenty dollars.With this money I shall
improve the other part, and build an addition 34 feet by 32 to the
present dwelling."He goes on into an architectural description, with drawings, of
the arched roof he intends to build, the present form of roof being
"unpleasing to the eye."He also draws an oak floor such as they make in
Paris, which he means to imitate.With a black cook, Rachel Gidney, the family seemed to be getting on
with fair comfort; but on Christmas Eve an event occurred which came
near bringing Paine's plans to an abrupt conclusion.This is related
in a letter to William Carver, New York, dated January 16th, at New
Rochelle."Esteemed Friend,--I have recd, two letters from you, one giving an
account of your taking Thomas to Mr.Foster*--the other dated Jany.12--I did not answer the first because I hoped to see you the next
Saturday or the Saturday after.* Thomas Bonneville, Paine's godson, at school in Stonington.What you heard of a gun being fired into the room is true--Robert and
Rachel were both gone out to keep Christmas Eve and about eight o'clock
at Night the gun were fired.Dean's
boys with me, but the person that had done it was gone.I directly
suspected who it was, and I halloed to him by name, that _he was
discovered_.I did this that the party who fired might know I was on the
watch.I cannot find any ball, but whatever the gun was charged with
passed through about three or four inches below the window making a hole
large enough to a finger to go through--the muzzle must have been very
near as the place is black with the powder, and the glass of the window
is shattered to pieces.Mr Shute after examining the place and getting
what information could be had, issued a warrant to take up Derrick, and
after examination committed him."He is now on bail (five hundred dollars) to take his trial at the
supreme Court in May next.Derrick owes me forty-eight dollars for which
I have his note, and he was to work it out in making stone fence which
he has not even begun and besides this I have had to pay forty-two
pounds eleven shillings for which I had passed my word for him at Mr.Derrick borrowed the Gun under pretence of giving Mrs.He was with Purdy about two hours before the
attack on the house was made and he came from thence to Dean's half
drunk and brought with him a bottle of Rum, and Purdy was with him when
he was taken up."I am exceedingly well in health and shall always be glad to see you.Hubbs tells me that your horse is getting better.Shute sent for
the horse and took him when the first snow came but he leaped the fences
and came back.If this be the case I
suppose he has broke or cracked it in leaping a fence when he was lame
on the other hind leg, and hung with his hind legs in the fence.I am
glad to hear what you tell me of Thomas.He shall not want for anything
that is necessary if he be a good boy for he has no friend but me.You
have not given me any account about the meeting house.The window of the room said to have been Paine's study is close to the
ground, and it is marvellous that he was not murdered.**

     * I am indebted for this letter to Dr.Clair J. Grece, of
     England, whose uncle, Daniel Constable, probably got it from
     Carver.** Derrick (or Dederick) appears by the records at White
     Plains to have been brought up for trial May 19, 1806, and
     to have been recognized in the sum of $500 for his
     appearance at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer and
     General Gaol Delivery, and in the meantime to keep the peace
     towards the

People, and especially towards Thomas Payne (sic).Paine, Christopher
Hubbs, and Andrew A. Dean were recognized in $50 to appear and give
evidence against Derrick.Nothing further appears in the records
(examined for me by Mr.B. D. Washburn up to 1810).It is pretty certain
that Paine did not press the charges.The most momentous change which had come over America during Paine's
absence was the pro-slavery reaction.This had set in with the first
Congress.An effort was made by the Virginia representatives to check
the slave traffic by imposing a duty of $10 on each <DW64> imported, but
was defeated by an alliance of members from more Southern States and
professedly antislavery men of the North.The Southern leader in this
first victory of slavery in Congress was Major Jackson of Georgia, who
defended the institution as scriptural and civilizing.Franklin published (Federal Gazette, March 25, 1790) a parody of
Jackson's speech, purporting to be a speech uttered in 1687 by a Divan
of Algiers in defence of piracy and slavery, against a sect of Erika,
or Purists, who had petitioned for their suppression.Franklin was now
president of the American Antislavery Society, founded in Philadelphia
in 1775 five weeks after the appearance of Paine's scheme of
emancipation (March 8, 1775).Rush was also active in the cause, and
to him Paine wrote (March 16, 1790) the letter on the subject elsewhere
quoted (L, p.This letter was published by Rush (Columbian
Magazine, vol.318) while the country was still agitated by the
debate which was going on in Congress at the time when it was written,
on a petition of the Antislavery Society, signed by Franklin,--his
last public act.Franklin died April 17, 1790, twenty-five days after the close of the
debate, in which he was bitterly denounced by the proslavery party.Washington had pronounced the petition "inopportune,"--his presidential
mansion in New York was a few steps from the slave-market,--Jefferson
(now Secretary of State) had no word to say for it, Madison had smoothed
over the matter by a compromise.Thenceforth slavery had become a
suppressed subject, and the slave trade, whenever broached in Congress,
had maintained its immunity.In 1803, even under Jefferson's
administration, the <DW64>s fleeing from oppression in Domingo were
forbidden asylum in America, because it was feared that they would
incite servile insurrections.That the United States, under presidency
of Jefferson, should stand aloof from the struggle of the <DW64>s in
Domingo for liberty, cut Paine to the heart.Unperturbed by the attempt
made on his own life a few days before, he wrote to Jefferson on New
Year's Day, 1805, (from New Rochelle,) what may be regarded as an
appeal:




{1805}

"Dear Sir,--I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as
I may as well spend a part of it there as elsewhere.But lest bad roads
or any other circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for
your consideration, and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of
Louisiana, we may happen to think alike without knowing what each other
had thought of."The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases
in which it now stands.If armed merchantmen force their way through the
blockading fleet it will embarrass us with the french Government;
and, on the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a
partiality to the french injurious to them there is danger they will
turn Pirates upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity
than the barbary powers, and England will encourage it, as she
encourages the Indians.Domingo is lost to France either as to the
Government or the possession of it, But if a way could be found out to
bring about a peace between france and Domingo through the mediation,
and under the guarantee of the United States, it would be beneficial to
all parties, and give us a great commercial and political standing,
not only with the present people of Domingo but with the West Indies
generally.And when we have gained their confidence by acts of
justice and friendship, they will listen to our advice in matters of
Civilization and Government, and prevent the danger of their becoming
pirates, which I think they will be, if driven to desperation."The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of
this kind.She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge
of the local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of
this kind superior to any European Nation.She is enabled by situation,
and grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as
her advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part
of Domingo be fulfilled.It is also a measure that accords with
the humanity of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial
interest."All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her
alone, and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for
this Domingo to give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of
years,--that is, to import from France all the utensils and manufactures
she may have occasion to use or consume (except such as she can more
conveniently procure from the manufactories of the United States), and
to pay for them in produce.France will gain more by this than she can
expect to do even by a conquest of the Island, and the advantage to
America will be that she will become the carrier of both, at least
during the present war."There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to
Domingo; and the events that have since taken place were then often
predicted.The opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that
the commerce of the Island was better than the conquest of it,--that the
conquest could not be accomplished without destroying the <DW64>s, and
in that case the Island would be of no value."I think it might be signified to the french Government, yourself is
the best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to
undertake an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless
slaughter on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in
point of commerce that the state of things will admit of.Such an offer,
whether accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a
good end."There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off
for Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington.I congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for
President and Vice-President."Yours in friendship,

"Thomas Paine."The journey to Washington was given up, and Paine had to content himself
with his pen.He took in several newspapers, and was as keenly alive
as ever to the movements of the world.His chief anxiety was lest some
concession might be made to the Louisianians about the slave trade, that
region being an emporium of the traffic which grew more enterprising and
brutal as its term was at hand.Much was said of the great need of the
newly acquired region for more laborers, and it was known that Jefferson
was by no means so severe in his opposition to slavery as he was once
supposed to be.The President repeatedly invited Paine's views, and they
were given fully and freely.The following extracts are from a letter
dated New York, January 25, 1805:

"Mr.Wingate called on me at N. York, where I
happened to be when they arrived on their Journey from Washington to
the Eastward: I find by Mr.Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will
have to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an
end to this business the better.The Cession of Louisiana is a great
acquisition; but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union
were the prayer of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lauds be
worth settling if the settlers are to be under a french jurisdiction....
When the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana become equal
to the number of french inhabitants it may then be proper and right to
erect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional state;
but to do it now would be sending the american settlers into exile....
For my own part, I wish the name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may
in a great measure be done by giving names to the new states that will
serve as descriptive of their situation or condition.France lost the
names and almost the remembrance of provinces by dividing them into
departments with appropriate names."Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it
is that of settling it.The people of the Eastern States are the
best settlers of a new country, and of people from abroad the German
Peasantry are the best.The Irish in general are generous and dissolute.The Scotch turn their attention to traffic, and the English to
manufactures.These people are more fitted to live in cities than to
be cultivators of new lands.I know not if in Virginia they are much
acquainted with the importation of German redemptioners, that is,
servants indented for a term of years.The best farmers in Pennsylvania
are those who came over in this manner or the descendants of them.The
price before the war used to be twenty pounds Pennsylvania currency for
an indented servant for four years, that is, the ship owner, got twenty
pounds per head passage money, so that upon two hundred persons he would
receive after their arrival four thousand pounds paid by the persons who
purchased the time of their indentures which was generally four
years.These would be the best people, of foreigners, to bring into
Louisiana--because they would grow to be citizens.Whereas bringing poor
<DW64>s to work the lands in a state of slavery and wretchedness, is,
besides the immorality of it, the certain way of preventing population
and consequently of preventing revenue.I question if the revenue
arising from ten <DW64>s in the consumption of imported articles is
equal to that of one white citizen.In the articles of dress and of the
table it is almost impossible to make a comparison."These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are
proper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always
fortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act
unitedly.But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a
french Jurisdiction.Congress must frame the laws under which they are
to serve out their time; after which Congress might give them a few
acres of land to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able
to buy more.I am inclined to believe that by adopting this method the
Country will be more peopled in about twenty years from the present time
than it has been in all the times of the french and Spaniards.Spain,
I believe, held it chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and
the less it was improved the better it agreed with that policy; and
as to france she never shewed any great disposition or gave any great
encouragement to colonizing.It is chiefly small countries, that are
straitened for room at home, like Holland and England, that go in quest
of foreign settlements....

"I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg.He tells
me that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America
carried them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors.He tells me
he has the Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding
persons shipping themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that
he will give me a copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send
with this letter.He says that the American Consul has been spoken to
respecting this kidnapping business under American pretences, but
that he says he has no authority to interfere.The German members of
Congress, or the Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been
in the practice of importing German redemptioners, can give you better
information respecting the business of importation than I can.But the
redemptioners thus imported must be at the charge of the Captain or
ship owner till their time is sold.Some of the quaker Merchants of
Philadelphia went a great deal into the importation of German servants
or redemptioners.It agreed with the morality of their principles that
of bettering people's condition, and to put an end to the practice of
importing slaves.I think it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose
that the population of Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls
every year.What <DW44>s the settlement of it is the want of labourers,
and until labourers can be had the sale of the lands will be slow.Were
I twenty years younger, and my name and reputation as well known in
European countries as it is now, I would contract for a quantity of land
in Louisiana and go to Europe and bring over settlers....

"It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an
excursion to Washington.The piece on Gouverneur Morris's Oration
on Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have
published; and as every thing of public affairs is now on a good ground
I shall do as I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator and attend
now to my own affairs."I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published,
beginning with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript,
and publish them by subscription.I have deferred doing this till the
presidential election should be over, but I believe there was not much
occasion for that caution.There is more hypocrisy than bigotry in
America.When I was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell
in company with some Baptists among whom were three Ministers.The
conversation turned on the election for President, and one of them who
appeared to be a leading man said 'They cry out against Mr.Jefferson
because, they say he is a Deist.Well, a Deist may be a good man, and if
he think it right, it is right to him.For my own part, said he, 'I had
rather vote for a Deist than for a blue-skin presbyterian.''You judge
right,' said I, 'for a man that is not of any of the sectaries will hold
the balance even between all; but give power to a bigot of any sectary
and he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the blue-skins
do in connection,' They all agree in this sentiment, and I have always
found it assented to in any company I have had occasion to use it."I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four
hundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid on delivery; and
as they will be delivered separately, as fast as they can be printed and
bound the subscribers may stop when they please.The three first volumes
will be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account
of the state of affairs at the time it was written, whether in America,
france, or England, which will also shew the occasion of writing it.of the Crisis published the 19th
December '76 is '_These are the times that try men's souls,_' It is
therefore necessary as explanatory to the expression in all future times
to shew what those times were.The two last volumes will be theological
and those who do not chuse to take them may let them alone.They will
have the right to do so, by the conditions of the subscription.I shall
also make a miscellaneous Volume of correspondence, Essays, and
some pieces of Poetry, which I believe will have some claim to
originality....

"I find by the Captain [from New Orleans] above mentioned that several
Liverpool ships have been at New Orleans.It is chiefly the people
of Liverpool that employ themselves in the slave trade and they bring
cargoes of those unfortunate <DW64>s to take back in return the hard
money and the produce of the country.Had I the command of the elements
I would blast Liverpool with fire and brimstone.It is the Sodom and
Gomorrah of brutality....

"I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the
<DW64>s tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negroe family
a quantity of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain
quantity of produce.I think that numbers of our free <DW64>s might be
provided for in this manner in Louisiana.The best way that occurs to me
is for Congress to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them
to hire themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would
by this means learn plantation business, after which to place them on a
tract of land as before mentioned.A great many good things may now be
done; and I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to
you."Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite
New York calls sometimes to see me.He is a very
respectable old man.I wish something had been done for him in Congress
on his petition; for I think something is due to him, nor do I see how
the Statute of limitation can consistently apply to him.The law in John
Adams's administration, which cut off all commerce and communication
with france, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put
in his claim.I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on
England, france and Spain is more than 6 or 7 years standing yet no
law of limitation, that I know of take place between nations or between
individuals of different nations.I consider a statute of limitation to
be a domestic law, and can only have a domestic operation.Miller,
one of the New York Senators in Congress, knows Landais and can give you
an account of him."Concerning my former letter, on Domingo, I intended had I come to
Washington to have talked with Pichon about it--if you had approved that
method, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way.The two
Emperors are at too great a distance in objects and in colour to have
any intercourse but by Fire and Sword, yet something I think might be
done.It is time I should close this long epistle.Paine made but a brief stay in New York (where he boarded with William
Carver).His next letter (April 22d) is from New Rochelle, written to
John Fellows, an auctioneer in New York City, one of his most faithful
friends."Citizen: I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the
boatman to call on you with it.He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I
will be obliged to you to see them safe on board.The boat will leave N.
Y. on friday."I have left my pen knife at Carver's.It is, I believe, in the writing
desk.It is a small french pen knife that slides into the handle.I wish
Carver would look behind the chest in the bed room.I miss some papers
that I suppose are fallen down there.The boys will bring up with them
one pair of the blankets Mrs.Bonneville took down and also my best
blanket which is at Carver's.--I send enclosed three dollars for a ream
of writing paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to
the boat.I wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with
them, and tell them that the better they behave the better it will be
for them.I am now their only dependance, and they ought to know it.of the Prospect, while I was at Carver's, are left there.since I came to New
Rochelle."'The Thomas mentioned in this letter was Paine's godson, and "Bebia" was
Benjamin,--the late Brigadier-General Bonneville, U. S. A. The third
son, Louis, had been sent to his father in France.The _Prospect_ was
Elihu Palmer's rationalistic paper.Early in this year a series of charges affecting Jefferson's public and
private character were published by one Hulbert, on the authority of
Thomas Turner of Virginia.Beginning with an old charge of cowardice,
while Governor (of which Jefferson had been acquitted by the Legislature
of Virginia), the accusation proceeded to instances of immorality,
persons and places being named.The following letter from New Rochelle,
July 19th, to John Fellows enclosed Paine's reply, which appeared in the
_American Citizen_, July 23d and 24th:

     * This letter is in the possession of Mr.Grenville Kane,
     Tuxedo, N. Y."Citizen--I inclose you two pieces for Cheetham's paper, which I wish
you to give to him yourself.in one daily paper,
and the other number in the next daily paper, and then both in his
country paper.There has been a great deal of anonimous (sic) abuse
thrown out in the federal papers against Mr.Jefferson, but until some
names could be got hold of it was fighting the air to take any notice
of them.We have now got hold of two names, your townsman Hulbert, the
hypocritical Infidel of Sheffield, and Thomas Turner of Virginia, his
correspondent.I have already given Hulbert a basting with my name
to it, because he made use of my name in his speech in the Mass.Turner has not given me the same cause in the letter he
wrote (and evidently) to Hulbert, and which Hulbert, (for it could be
no other person) has published in the Repertory to vindicate himself.Jefferson, and I have taken
them up one by one, which is the first time the opportunity has offered
for doing it; for before this it was promiscuous abuse.I have not
signed it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I
found myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little
smart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are
some sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my
stile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish
Mr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of
any thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett
accompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,
who is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be
obliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.You did not
tell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the
enclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for
you never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,
Paine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without
trustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended
that it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as
Congress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark
from the Altar of '76," but the writer was easily recognized.The
service thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and
Charters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New
York of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This
defeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one
legislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all
matters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants
of land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a
legislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an
article been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery
and corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late
legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
place.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they
had no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New
York.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk
English, and did not appreciate Paine's idea of plain living and high
thinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,
and, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts
the unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,
practically fatherless, some start in life.The philosophic solitude in
which he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)
to John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as
a teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for
herself.I will take care of him for his
own sake and his father's, but that is all I have to say.... I am
master of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a
straw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
snuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
Chair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come
you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,
fruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I
live with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Bonneville was
an encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do
anything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you
cannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and
you will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if
they have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]
the piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers
on Turner's letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous
paragraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of
such editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want
to come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I
wish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which
     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,
     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that
there was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one
years younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old
gentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little
companionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he
indulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,
devoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless
reverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick's attempt on Paine's life she became
nervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she
presently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several
families.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,
who had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their
affection.*

     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an
     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),
     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a
     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,
     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been
     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,
Philadelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of
Pennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."It opens with a
reference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I
now am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I
address this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance
of former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the
negative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament's badge of
disgrace under William of Normandy, a defence of personal prerogative
that ought to find no place in a republic.He advises that in the new
Constitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should
be established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he
should make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation
of the House of Lords.The Representatives should be divided by lot into
two equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not
being entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor
committed by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,
and be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two
houses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should
be removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of
impeachment at "stated periods."(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator
Mitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by
the President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,
on the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,
etc.The two essays prove that
there was no abatement in Paine's intellect, and that despite occasional
"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was
still occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in
New Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the
house, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let
and he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux
House, which is still standing,*--but Paine's pecuniary situation now
gave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be
far less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the
President, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to
allude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,
had once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He
suggests that Congress should remember his services.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about
     Dederick's attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take
it will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been
a volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from
anything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all
profits that those publications might come cheap among the people for
whom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been
received.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow
Fever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with
it Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he
dates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out
that the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been
unknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not
reach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease
certainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from
New York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of
the wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the
West Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves
were built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the
shore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter
decaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of
arches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the
North River.Francis justly remarks, in his "Old New York," that Paine's writings
were usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the
essay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,
there being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and learning, traces
Freemasonry to the ancient solar mythology also identified with
Christian mythology--was not published during his life.It was published
by Madame Bonneville with the passages affecting Christianity omitted.The original manuscript was obtained, however, and published with an
extended preface, criticizing Paine's theory, the preface being in
turn criticized by Paine's editor.The preface was probably written by
Colonel Fellows, author of a large work on Freemasonry.A NEW YORK PROMETHEUS

When Paine left Bordentown, on March 1st 1803, driving past placards of
the devil flying away with him, and hooted by a pious mob at Trenton,
it was with hope of a happy reunion with old friends in more enlightened
New York.Few, formerly senator from Georgia, his friend of many
years, married Paine's correspondent, Kitty Nicholson, to whom was
written the beautiful letter from London (L, p.Few had
become a leading man in New York, and his home, and that of the
Nicholsons, were of highest social distinction.Paine's arrival at
Lovett's Hotel was well known, but not one of those former friends came
near him."They were actively as well as passively religious," says
Henry Adams, "and their relations with Paine after his return to America
in 1802 were those of compassion only, for his intemperate and offensive
habits, and intimacy was impossible.Adams will vainly search
his materials for any intimation at that time of the intemperate or
offensive habits.Gallatin continued to risk
     Paine.360

The "compassion" is due to those devotees of an idol requiring sacrifice
of friendship, loyalty, and intelligence.The
old author was as a grand organ from which a cunning hand might bring
music to be remembered through the generations.In that brain were
stored memories of the great Americans, Frenchmen, Englishmen who acted
in the revolutionary dramas, and of whom he loved to talk.What would a
diary of interviews with Paine, written by his friend Kitty Few, be now
worth?To intolerance, the least pardonable form of ignorance, must be
credited the failure of those former friends, who supposed themselves
educated, to make more of Thomas Paine than a scarred monument of an Age
of Unreason.But the ostracism of Paine by the society which, as Henry Adams states,
had once courted him "as the greatest literary genius of his day,"
was not due merely to his religious views, which were those of various
statesmen who had incurred no such odium.There was at work a lingering
dislike and distrust of the common people.From the scholastic study, where heresies once
written only in Latin were daintily wrapped up in metaphysics, from
drawing-rooms where cynical smiles went round at Methodism, and other
forms of "Christianity in earnest," Paine carried heresy to the people.And he brought it as a religion,--as fire from the fervid heaven
that orthodoxy had monopolized.The popularity of his writing, the
revivalistic earnestness of his protest against dogmas common to all
sects, were revolutionary; and while the vulgar bigots were binding him
on their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the
social leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have
felt.**

     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March
     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being
     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously
     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,
     who lived to denounce Channing as "the devil's disciple."Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher's
     church.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit
     Paine, for which he was "suspended."Thorburn afterwards
     made amends by fathering Cheetham's slanders of Paine after
     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and
maltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had
warmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems
to have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu
Palmer.'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much
interested in the "cause":

"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from
Groton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal
of sincere enthusiasm.The publication of it would do good, but there is
an impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter.You
may show the letter to Palmer and Foster.... Remember me to my much
respected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we shall succeed if we
hold on.We have already silenced the clamor of the priests.They act
now as if they would say, let us alone and we will let you alone.You do
not tell me if the Prospect goes on.As Carver will want pay he may have
it from me, and pay when it suits him; but I expect he will take a ride
up some Saturday, and then he can chuse for himself."The result of this was that Paine passed the winter in New York,
where he threw himself warmly into the theistic movement, and no doubt
occasionally spoke from Elihu Palmer's platform.The rationalists who gathered around Elihu Palmer in New York were
called the "Columbian Illuminati."The pompous epithet looks like an
effort to connect them with the Columbian Order (Tammany) which was
supposed to represent Jacobinism and French ideas generally.John moved to the hallway.Their
numbers were considerable, but they did not belong to fashionable
society.Their lecturer, Elihu Palmer, was a scholarly gentleman of the
highest character.A native of Canterbury, Connecticut, (born 1754) he
had graduated at Dartmouth.Watt to
a widow, Mary Powell, in New York (1803), at the time when he was
lecturing in the Temple of Reason (Snow's Rooms, Broadway).This
suggests that he had not broken with the clergy altogether.Somewhat
later he lectured at the Union Hotel, William Street He had studied
divinity, and turned against the creeds what was taught him for their
support."I have more than once [says Dr.Francis] listened to Palmer; none could
be weary within the sound of his voice; his diction was classical; and
much of his natural theology attractive by variety of illustration.But admiration of him sank into despondency at his assumption, and his
sarcastic assaults on things most holy.His boldest phillippic was his
discourse on the title-page of the Bible, in which, with the double
shield of jacobinism and infidelity, he warned rising America against
confidence in a book authorised by the monarchy of England.Palmer
delivered his sermons in the Union Hotel in William Street."Francis does not appear to have known Paine personally, but had seen
him.Palmer's chief friends in New York were, he says, John Fellows;
Rose, an unfortunate lawyer; Taylor, a philanthropist; and Charles
Christian.John Foster, another rationalist lecturer, Dr.Francis says he had a noble presence and great eloquence.Foster's
exordium was an invocation to the goddess of Liberty.John Fellows, always the devoted friend of Paine, was an
auctioneer, but in later life was a constable in the city courts.He
has left three volumes which show considerable literary ability, and
industrious research; but these were unfortunately bestowed on such
extinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies
concerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel
Fellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was
in especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,
and Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the
State Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on
Paine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36
Cedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced
himself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman
at Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud
professions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes
had become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active
rationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver's probably shortened Paine's life.Carver, to
anticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man
and a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious
subjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804
by Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This
succeeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine's
objects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of
attention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon
by Robert Hall, on "Modern Infidelity," sent him by a gentleman in New
York.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:

"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and
how is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not
redeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that
Adam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby
subjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus
Christ to affect or alter the case?If so,
would it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden
tree, and made a new man?""Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and
Pontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of
salvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,
was never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the
sacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the
calendar of Saints."Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: "Of the word Religion";
"Cain and Abel"; "The Tower of Babel"; "Of the religion of Deism
compared with the Christian Religion"; "Of the Sabbath Day in
Connecticut"; "Of the Old and New Testaments"; "Hints towards forming a
Society for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,
so far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and
modern"; "To the members of the Society styling itself the Missionary
Society"; "On Deism, and the writings of Thomas Paine"; "Of the Books
of the New Testament" There were several communications without any
heading.Passages and sentences from these little essays have long been
a familiar currency among freethinkers."We admire the wisdom of the ancients, yet they had no bibles, nor
books, called revelation.They cultivated the reason that God gave them,
studied him in his works, and rose to eminence.""The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other than the ancient
Egyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the darkness and the light, which
answered very well as allegory without being believed as fact.""Those who most believe the Bible are those who know least about it.""Another observation upon the story of Babel is the inconsistence of it
with respect to the opinion that the bible is the word of God given for
the information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent
such a word being known by mankind as confounding their language.""God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us.""Jesus never speaks of Adam, of the Garden of Eden, nor of what is
called the fall of man.""Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
themselves carry on?"[On the presentation of a Bible to some Osage
chiefs in New York.]"The remark of the Emperor Julian is worth observing.'If, said he,
'there ever had been or could be a Tree of Knowledge, instead of God
forbidding man to eat thereof, it would be that of which he would order
him to eat the most.'""Do Christians not see that their own religion is founded on a human
sacrifice?Many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on
the altar of the Christian Religion.""For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines."The Bible has been received by Protestants on the authority of the
Church of Rome.""The same degree of hearsay evidence, and that at third and fourth hand,
would not, in a court of justice, give a man title to a cottage, and
yet the priests of this profession presumptuously promise their deluded
followers the kingdom of Heaven.""Nobody fears for the safety of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may
be washed away.Blow then, O ye priests, 'the Trumpet in Zion,' for the
Hillock is in danger."The force of Paine's negations was not broken by any weakness for
speculations of his own.He constructed no system to invite the missiles
of antagonists.It is, indeed, impossible to deny without affirming;
denial that two and two make five affirms that they make four.The basis
of Paine's denials being the divine wisdom and benevolence, there was in
his use of such expressions an implication of limitation in the divine
nature.Wisdom implies the necessity of dealing with difficulties, and
benevolence the effort to make all sentient creatures happy.Neither
quality is predicable of an omniscient and omnipotent being, for whom
there could be no difficulties or evils to overcome.confuse the world with his doubts or with his mere opinions.He stuck to
his certainties, that the scriptural deity was not the true one, nor
the dogmas called Christian reasonable.But he felt some of the moral
difficulties surrounding theism, and these were indicated in his reply
to the Bishop of Llandaff."The Book of Job belongs either to the ancient Persians, the Chaldeans,
or the Egyptians; because the structure of it is consistent with the
dogma they held, that of a good and evil spirit, called in Job God
and Satan, existing as distinct and separate beings, and it is not
consistent with any dogma of the Jews.... The God of the Jews was the
God of everything.According to Exodus
it was God, and not the Devil, that hardened Pharaoh's heart.According
to the Book of Samuel it was an evil spirit from God that troubled
Saul.And Ezekiel makes God say, in speaking of the Jews, 'I gave them
statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not
live.'...As to the precepts, principles, and maxims in the Book of Job,
they show that the people abusively called the heathen, in the books
of the Jews, had the most sublime ideas of the Creator, and the most
exalted devotional morality.It was
the Gentiles who glorified him."Several passages in Paine's works show that he did not believe in a
personal devil; just what he did believe was no doubt written in a part
of his reply to the Bishop, which, unfortunately, he did not live to
carry through the press.In the part that we have he expresses
the opinion that the Serpent of Genesis is an allegory of winter,
necessitating the "coats of skins" to keep Adam and Eve warm, and adds:
"Of these things I shall speak fully when I come in another part to
speak of the ancient religion of the Persians, and compare it with the
modern religion of the New Testament" But this part was never published.The part published was transcribed by Paine and given, not long before
his death, to the widow of Elihu Palmer, who published it in the
_Theophilanthropist_ in 1810.Paine had kept the other part, no doubt
for revision, and it passed with his effects into the hands of Madame
Bonneville, who eventually became a devotee.She either suppressed it or
sold it to some one who destroyed it.We can therefore only infer from
the above extract the author's belief on this momentous point.It seems
clear that he did not attribute any evil to the divine Being.In the
last article Paine published he rebukes the "Predestinarians" for
dwelling mainly on God's "physical attribute" of power."The Deists, in
addition to this, believe in his moral attributes, those of justice and
goodness."Among Paine's papers was found one entitled "My private thoughts of a
Future State," from which his editors have dropped important sentences."I have said in the first part of the Age of Reason that 'I hope for
happiness after this life,' This hope is comfortable to me, and I
presume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope, with respect to a
future state.I consider myself in the hands of my Creator, and that he
will dispose of me after this life, consistently with his justice and
goodness.I leave all these matters to him as my Creator and friend,
and I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article of faith as to
what the Creator will do with us hereafter.I do not believe, because
a man and a woman make a child, that it imposes on the Creator the
unavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existence
hereafter.It is in his power to do so, or not to do so, and it is not
in our power to decide which he will do."[After quoting from Matthew
25th the figure of the sheep and goats he continues:] "The world cannot
be thus divided.The moral world, like the physical world, is composed
of numerous degrees of character, running imperceptibly one into the
other, in such a manner that no fixed point can be found in either.That
point is nowhere, or is everywhere.The whole world might be divided
into two parts numerically, but not as to moral character; and therefore
the metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can be divided, whose
difference is marked by their external figure, is absurd.All sheep are
still sheep; all goats are still goats; it is their physical nature to
be so.But one part of the world are not all good alike, nor the
other part all wicked alike.There are some exceedingly good, others
exceedingly wicked.There is another description of men who cannot be
ranked with either the one or the other--they belong neither to the
sheep nor the goats.And there is still another description of them who
are so very insignificant, both in character and conduct, as not to be
worth the trouble of damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.My
own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good,
and endeavouring to make their fellow mortals happy, for this is the
only way in which we can serve God, will be happy hereafter; and that
the very wicked will meet with some punishment.But those who are
neither good nor bad, or are too insignificant for notice, will be dropt
entirely.It is consistent with my idea of God's
justice, and with the reason that God has given me, and I gratefully
know that he has given me a large share of that divine gift."The closing tribute to his own reason, written in privacy, was, perhaps
pardonably, suppressed by the modern editor, and also the reference to
the insignificant who "will be dropt entirely."This sentiment is not
indeed democratic, but it is significant.It seems plain that Paine's
conception of the universe was dualistic.Though he discards the notion
of a devil, I do not find that he ever ridicules it.No doubt he would,
were he now living, incline to a division of nature into organic and
inorganic, and find his deity, as Zoroaster did, in the living as
distinguished from, and sometimes in antagonism with, the "not-living".In this belief he would now find himself in harmony with some of the
ablest modern philosophers.*

     * John Stuart Mill, for instance.Abbott's "Kernel and Husk" (London), and the great work of
     Samuel Laing, "A Modern Zoroastrian."{1806}

The opening year 1806 found Paine in New Rochelle.By insufficient
nourishment in Carver's house his health was impaired.His means were
getting low, insomuch that to support the Bonnevilles he had to sell the
Bordentown house and property.*

     * It was bought for $300 by his friend John Oliver, whose
     daughter, still residing in the house, told me that her
     father to the end of his life "thought everything of Paine."John Oliver, in his old age, visited Colonel Ingersoll in
     order to testify against the aspersions on Paine's character
     and habits.Elihu Palmer had gone off to Philadelphia for a time; he died there of
yellow fever in 1806.The few intelligent people whom Paine knew were
much occupied, and he was almost without congenial society.His hint to
Jefferson of his impending poverty, and his reminder that Virginia had
not yet given him the honorarium he and Madison approved, had brought
no result.With all this, and the loss of early friendships, and the
theological hornet-nest he had found in New York, Paine began to feel
that his return to America was a mistake.The air-castle that had allured him to his beloved land had faded.His
little room with the Bonnevilles in Paris, with its chaos of papers, was
preferable; for there at least he could enjoy the society of educated
persons, free from bigotry.He dwelt a stranger in his Land of Promise.So he resolved to try and free himself from his depressing environment.Jefferson had offered him a ship to
return in, perhaps he would now help him to get back.30th) a letter to the President, pointing out the probabilities of a
crisis in Europe which must result in either a descent on England by
Bonaparte, or in a treaty.In the case that the people of England should
be thus liberated from tyranny, he (Paine) desired to share with his
friends there the task of framing a republic.Should there be, on the
other hand, a treaty of peace, it would be of paramount interest to
American shipping that such treaty should include that maritime compact,
or safety of the seas for neutral ships, of which Paine had written
so much, and which Jefferson himself had caused to be printed in a
pamphlet.Both of these were, therefore, Paine's subjects."I think," he
says, "you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a person to
France in the event of either a treaty or a descent, and I make you an
offer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.Monroe.... As I think
that the letters of a friend to a friend have some claim to an answer,
it will be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any
wish that you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what
is proper or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May."Paine must face the fact that his
career is ended.It is probable that Elihu Palmer's visit to Philadelphia was connected
with some theistic movement in that city.How it was met, and what
annoyances Paine had to suffer, are partly intimated in the following
letter, printed in the Philadelphia _Commercial Advertiser_, February
10, 1806."To John Inskeep, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia."I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and
signed Isaac Hall.It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in
refusing to let him have Vine-st.Wharf after he had bid fifty
dollars more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been
unanimously approved of by the Commissioners appointed by law for that
purpose.Among the reasons given by you for this refusal, one was, that
'_Mr Hall was one of Paine's disciples_.'If those whom you may chuse to
call my disciples follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will
pass the confines of this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish and delusion sink into despair.Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of
Inskeep at Philadelphia in '_the time that tried men's souls._* He must
be some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which
the generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;
neither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care,
for if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class
or sectary he may hypocritically belong."As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little
consequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a
declaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance.Here it is:
My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
him to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne
my share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made
for this purpose.And my motive and object in all my publications on
religious subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason,
have been to bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy,
and a benevolent disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to
excite in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation in his
creator, unshackled by the fable and fiction of books, by whatever
invented name they may be called.I am happy in the continual
contemplation of what I have done, and I thank God that he gave
me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it It will make the
continual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they finally
arrive."'_These are the times that try men's souls_.'1, written
while on the retreat with the army from fort Lee to the Delaware and
published in Philadelphia in the dark days of 1776 December the 19th,
six days before the taking of the Hessians at Trenton."But the year 1806 had a heavier blow yet to inflict on Paine, and
it naturally came, though in a roundabout way, from his old enemy
Gouverneur Morris.While at New Rochelle, Paine offered his vote at the
election, and it was refused, on the ground that he was not an American
citizen!The supervisor declared that the former American Minister,
Gouverneur Morris, had refused to reclaim him from a French prison
because he was not an American, and that Washington had also refused to
reclaim him.Gouverneur Morris had just lost his seat in Congress,
and was politically defunct, but his ghost thus rose on poor Paine's
pathway.The supervisor who disfranchised the author of "Common Sense"
had been a "Tory" in the Revolution; the man he disfranchised was one to
whom the President of the United States had written, five years before:
"I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments
worthy of former times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily
labored, and with as much effect as any man living."There was not any
question of Paine's qualification as a voter on other grounds than the
supervisor (Elisha Ward) raised.More must presently be said concerning
this incident.Paine announced his intention of suing the inspectors,
but meanwhile he had to leave the polls in humiliation.It was the fate
of this founder of republics to be a monument of their ingratitude.And
now Paine's health began to fail.An intimation of this appears in a
letter to Andrew A. Dean, to whom his farm at New Rochelle was let,
dated from New York, August, 1806.It is in reply to a letter from Dean
on a manuscript which Paine had lent him.*

     * "I have read," says Dean,  "with good attention your
     manuscript on dreams, and Examination of the Prophecies in
     the Bible.I am now searching the old prophecies, and
     comparing the same to those said to be quoted in the New
     Testament.I confess the comparison is a matter worthy of
     our serious attention; I know not the result till I finish;
     then, if you be living, I shall communicate the same to
     you.Paine was now living with
     Jarvis, the artist.One evening he fell as if by apoplexy,
     and, as he lay, his first word was (to Jarvis): "My
     corporeal functions have ceased; my intellect is clear;
     this is a proof of immortality.""Respected Friend: I received your friendly letter, for which I am
obliged to you.It is three weeks ago to day (Sunday, Aug.15,) that I
was struck with a fit of an apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense
and motion.I had neither pulse nor breathing, and the people about me
supposed me dead.I had felt exceedingly well that day, and had just
taken a slice of bread and butter for supper, and was going to bed.The
fit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through the
head; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been able
to get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted
out in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties
have remained as perfect as I ever enjoyed them.I consider the scene I
have passed through as an experiment on dying, and I find death has
no terrors for me.As to the people called Christians, they have no
evidence that their religion is true.There is no more proof that the
Bible is the word of God, than that the Koran of Mahomet is the word of
God.Man, before he begins to
think for himself, is as much the child of habit in Creeds as he is in
ploughing and sowing.Yet creeds, like opinions, prove nothing.Where is
the evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of
God?The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our mental
faculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a thing
is comprehensible.It cannot therefore be an object for faith to
act upon, for faith is nothing more than an assent the mind gives to
something it sees cause to believe is fact.But priests, preachers, and
fanatics, put imagination in the place of faith, and it is the nature
of the imagination to believe without evidence.If Joseph the carpenter
dreamed (as the book of Matthew, chapter 1st, says he did,) that his
betrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that an
angel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dream; nor do I
put any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and
foolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.--The Christian
religion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.It puts the
Creator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian Devil
above him.It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that
outwits the Creator, in the garden of Eden, and steals from him his
favorite creature, man; and, at last, obliges him to beget a son, and
put that son to death, to get man back again.And this the priests of
the Christian religion, call redemption."Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering human
sacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those
authors make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own
doctrine of salvation is founded on a human sacrifice.They are saved,
they say, by the blood of Christ.The Christian religion begins with a
dream and ends with a murder."As I am well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well
enough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done,
in endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has
given him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to
fanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated
or ferocious."As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the word of
God.It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times
and bad men.There are but a few good characters in the whole book.The
fable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun
and the twelve signs of the Zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of
the eastern world, is the least hurtful part.Every thing told of Christ
has reference to the sun.His reported resurrection is at sunrise,
and that on the first day of the week; that is, on the day anciently
dedicated to the sun, and from thence called Sunday; in latin Dies
Solis, the day of the sun; as the next day, Monday, is Moon day.But
there is no room in a letter to explain these things.While man keeps
to the belief of one God, his reason unites with his creed.He is not
shocked with contradictions and horrid stories.His bible is the heavens
and the earth.He beholds his Creator in all his works, and every thing
he beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude.From the goodness
of God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands
self-reproved when he transgresses it.But
when he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can have
neither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the garden of
Eden, the talking serpent, the fall of man, the dreams of Joseph the
carpenter, the pretended resurrection and ascension, of which there is
even no historical relation, for no historian of those times mentions
such a thing, he gets into the pathless region of confusion, and turns
either frantic or hypocrite.He forces his mind, and pretends to
believe what he does not believe.This is in general the case with the
Methodists."I have now my friend given you a fac-simile of my mind on the subject
of religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you may make this letter as
publicly known as you find opportunities of doing.{1807}

The "Essay on Dream" was written early in 1806 and printed in May,
1807.It was the last work of importance written by Paine.In the same
pamphlet was included a part of his reply to the Bishop of Llandaff,
which was written in France: "An Examination of the Passages in the New
Testament, quoted from the Old, and called Prophecies of the Coming
of Jesus Christ" The Examination is widely known and is among Paine's
characteristic works,--a continuation of the "Age of Reason."The "Essay
on Dream" is a fine specimen of the author's literary art.Dream is the
imagination awake while the judgment is asleep."Every person is mad
once in twenty-four hours; for were he to act in the day as he dreams
in the night, he would be confined for a lunatic."Nathaniel Hawthorne
thought spiritualism "a sort of dreaming awake."Paine explained in the
same way some of the stories on which popular religion is founded.The
incarnation itself rests on what an angel told Joseph in a dream, and
others are referred to."This story of dreams has thrown Europe into
a dream for more than a thousand years.All the efforts that nature,
reason, and conscience have made to awaken man from it have been
ascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the workings of the devil,
and had it not been for the American revolution, which by establishing
the universal right of conscience, first opened the way to free
discussion, and for the French revolution which followed, this religion
of dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had ceased to
be believed."But Paine was to be reminded that the revolution had not made conscience
free enough in America to challenge waking dreams without penalties.The
following account of his disfranchisement at New Rochelle, was written
from Broome St., New York, May 4, 1807, to Vice-President Clinton."Respected Friend,--Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who
lived within the british lines in the revolutionary war, got in to
be inspectors of the election last year at New Rochelle.These men refused my vote at the election, saying to me:
'You are not an American; our minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris,
would not reclaim you when you were emprisoned in the Luxembourg prison
at Paris, and General Washington refused to do it.'Upon my telling
him that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and that if he did me
injustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling for a constable,
said to me, 'I will commit you to prison.'He chose, however, to sit
down and go no farther with it.Monro's
letter to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr.Monro gives
the government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in
consequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr.Randolph's
answer, in which he says: 'The President approves what you have done in
the case of Mr.The matter I believe is, that, as I had not
been guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did.As
to Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his
reclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he did not intend it
should.Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a body to
reclaim me, but their application, being unofficial, was not regarded.I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested
copies from the Secretary of State's office it will prove the lie on the
inspectors."As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration
of independence, they know nothing of what the political state of
the country was at the time the pamphlet 'Common Sense' appeared; and
besides this there are but few of the old standers left, and none that I
know of in this city."It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the
jury back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in
your way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from
your own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the
effect which the work 'Common Sense,' and the several members (numbers)
of the 'Crisis' had upon the country.It would, I think, be best that
the letter should begin directly on the subject in this manner: Being
informed that Thomas Paine has been denied his rights of citizenship by
certain persons acting as inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, &c."I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr.Riker, district
attorney, who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and
Jury.Your handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary.Had you been on the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had
been too inconvenient to you to have attended.To this Clinton replied from Washington, 12th May, 1807:

"Dear Sir,--I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 4th
instant, yesterday; agreeably to your request I have this day written a
letter to Richard Riker, Esquire, which he will show you.I doubt much,
however, whether the Court will admit it to be read as evidence."I am indebted to you for a former letter.I can make no other apology
for not acknowledging it before than inability to give you such an
answer as I could wish.I constantly keep the subject in mind, and
should any favorable change take place in the sentiments of the
Legislature, I will apprize you of it."I am, with great esteem, your sincere friend."In the letter to Madison, Paine tells the same story.At the end he says
that Morris' reclamation was not out of any good will to him."I know
not what he wrote to the french minister; whatever it was he concealed
it from me."He also says Morris could hardly keep himself out of
prison.*

     * The letter is in Mr.Frederick McGuire's collection of
     Madison papers.A letter was also written to Joel Barlow, at Washington, dated Broome
Street, New York, May 4th.He says in this:

"I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.You
and other Americans in Paris went in a body to the Convention to reclaim
me, and I want a certificate from you, properly attested, of this fact.Clinton he will in friendship inform you who to
address it to."Having now done with business I come to meums and tuums.You sometimes hear of me but I never hear of you.It seems as if
I had got to be master of the feds and the priests.The former do not
attack my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of
sight by silence.And as to the priests, they act as if they would say,
let us alone and we will let you alone.My Examination of the passages
called prophecies is printed, and will be published next week.I have
prepared it with the Essay on Dream.I do not believe that the priests
will attack it, for it is not a book of opinions but of facts.Had the
Christian Religion done any good in the world I would not have exposed
it, however fabulous I might believe it to be.But the delusive idea of
having a friend at court whom they call a redeemer, who pays all their
scores, is an encouragement to wickedness.Is he taming a whale to draw his submarine
boat?Smith to send me his country National
Intelligencer.I
am somewhat at a loss for want of authentic intelligence.It will be seen that Paine was still in ignorance of the conspiracy
which had thrown him in prison, nor did he suspect that Washington
had been deceived by Gouverneur Morris, and that his private letter to
Washington might have been given over to Pickering.*

     * In Chapter X. of this volume, as originally printed, there
     were certain passages erroneously suggesting that Pickering
     might have even intercepted this important letter of
     September 20, 1795.I had not then observed a reference to
     that letter by Madison, in writing to Monroe (April 7,
     1796), which proves that Paine's communication to Washington
     had been read by Pickering.Monroe was anxious lest some
     attack on the President should be written by Paine while
     under his roof,--an impropriety avoided by Paine as we have
     seen,--and had written to Madison on the subject.Madison
     answers: "I have given the explanation you desired to F. A.
     M[uhlenberg], who has not received any letter as yet, and
     has promised to pay due regard to your request.It is proper
     you should know that Thomas Paine wrote some time ago a
     severe letter to the President which Pickering mentioned to
     me in harsh terms when I delivered a note from Thomas Paine
     to the Secretary of State, inclosed by T. P. in a letter to
     me.Nothing passed, however, that betrayed the least
     association of your patronage or attention to Thomas Paine
     with the circumstance; nor am I apprehensive that any real
     suspicion can exist of your countenancing or even knowing
     the steps taken by T. P. under the influence of his personal
     feelings or political principles.At the same time the
     caution you observe is by no means to be disapproved.Be so
     good as to let T. P. know that I have received his letter
     and handed his note to the Secretary of State, which
     requested copies of such letters as might have been written
     hence in his behalf.The note did not require any answer
     either to me or through me, and I have heard nothing of it
     since I handed it to Pickering."At this time the Secretary
     of State's office contained the President's official
     recognition of Paine's citizenship; but this application
     for the papers relating to his imprisonment by a foreign
     power received no reply, though it was evidently couched in
     respectful terms; as the letter was open for the eye of
     Madison, who would not have conveyed it otherwise.It is
     incredible that Washington could have sanctioned such an
     outrage on one he had recognized as an American citizen,
     unless under pressure of misrepresentations.Possibly
     Paine's Quaker and republican direction of his letter to
     "George Washington, President of the United States," was
     interpreted by his federalist ministers as an insult.It will be seen, by Madame Bonneville's and Jarvis' statements
elsewhere, that Paine lost his case against Elisha Ward, on what ground
it is difficult to imagine.The records of the Supreme Court, at Albany,
and the Clerk's office at White Plains, have been vainly searched for
any trace of this trial.John H. Riker, son of Paine's counsel, has
examined the remaining papers of Richard Riker (many were accidentally
destroyed) without finding anything related to the matter.It is so
terrible to think that with Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison at the head
of the government, and the facts so clear, the federalist Elisha Ward
could vindicate his insult to Thomas Paine, that it may be hoped the
publication of these facts will bring others to light that may put a
better face on the matter.*

     * Gilbert Vale relates an anecdote which suggests that a
     reaction may have occurred in Elisha Ward's family: "At the
     time of Mr.Paine's residence at his farm, Mr.Ward, now a
     coffee-roaster in Gold Street, New York, and an assistant
     alderman, was then a little boy and residing at New
     Rochelle.He remembers the impressions his mother and some
     religious people made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so
     that he concluded that Tom Paine must be a very bad and
     brutal man.Some of his elder companions proposed going into
     Mr.Paine's orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of
     fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, with
     surprise, Mr.Paine come out and assist the boys in getting
     apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and
     directing them where to get the best.He then advanced and
     received his share of encouragement, and the impression this
     kindness made on him determined him at a very early period
     to examine his writings.His mother at first took the books
     from him, but at a later period restored them to him,
     observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself;
     perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as
     to his character and writings."Madame Bonneville may have misunderstood the procedure for which she
had to pay costs, as Paine's legatee.Whether an ultimate decision was
reached or not, the sufficiently shameful fact remains that Thomas Paine
was practically disfranchised in the country to which he had rendered
services pronounced pre-eminent by Congress, by Washington, and by every
soldier and statesman of the Revolution.Paine had in New York the most formidable of enemies,--an enemy with a
newspaper.This was James Cheetham, of whom something has been said in
the preface to this work (p.In addition to what is there stated,
it may be mentioned that Paine had observed, soon after he came to New
York, the shifty course of this man's paper, _The American Citizen_.But it was the only republican paper in New York, supported Governor
Clinton, for which it had reason, since it had the State printing,--and
Colonel Fellows advised that Cheetham should not be attacked.Cheetham
had been an attendant on Elihu Palmer's lectures, and after his
participation in the dinner to Paine, his federalist opponent, the
_Evening Post_, alluded to his being at Palmer's.Thereupon Cheetham
declared that he had not heard Palmer for two years.In the winter
of 1804 he casually spoke of Paine's "mischievous doctrines."In the
following year, when Paine wrote the defence of Jefferson's personal
character already alluded to, Cheetham omitted a reference in it
to Alexander Hamilton's pamphlet, by which he escaped accusation of
official defalcation by confessing an amorous intrigue.*

     *  "I see that Cheetham has left out the part respecting
     Hamilton and Mrs.Reynolds, but for my own part I wish it
     had been in.Had the story never been publicly told I
     would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton had
     told it himself, and therefore it was no secret; but my
     motive in introducing it was because it was applicable to
     the subject I was upon, and to show the revilers of Mr.Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of horror
     at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr.Jefferson, they
     had better look at home and give vent to their horror, if
     they had any, at a real case of their own Dagon (sic) and
     his Delilah."--Paine to Colonel Fellows, July 31, 1805.Cheetham having been wont to write of Hamilton as "the gallant of Mrs.Reynolds," Paine did not give much credit to the pretext of respect for
the dead, on which the suppression was justified.He was prepared to
admit that his allusion might be fairly suppressed, but perceived that
the omission was made merely to give Cheetham a chance for vaunting his
superior delicacy, and casting a suspicion on Paine."Cheetham," wrote
Paine, "might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for
which he left it out.Those reasons leave people to suspect that the
part suppressed related to some new discovered immorality in Hamilton
worse than the old story."About the same time with Paine, an Irishman came to America, and, after
travelling about the country a good deal, established a paper in New
York called _The People's Friend_.This paper began a furious onslaught
on the French, professed to have advices that Napoleon meant to retake
New Orleans, and urged an offensive alliance of the United States with
England against France and Spain.These articles appeared in the early
autumn of 1806, when, as we have seen, Paine was especially beset by
personal worries.His denunciations, merited as
they were, of this assailant of France reveal the unstrung condition of
the old author's nerves.Duane, of the Philadelphia _Aurora_, recognized
in Carpenter a man he had seen in Calcutta, where he bore the name of
Cullen.It was then found that he had on his arrival in America borne
the _alias_ of Mac-cullen.Paine declared that he was an "emissary"
sent to this country by Windham, and indeed most persons were at length
satisfied that such was the case.Paine insisted that loyalty to our
French alliance demanded Cullen's expulsion.His exposures of "the
emissary Cullen" (who disappeared) were printed in a new republican
paper in New York, _The Public Advertiser_, edited by Mr.The
combat drew public attention to the new paper, and Cheetham was probably
enraged by Paines transfer of his pen to Frank.In 1807, Paine had a
large following in New York, his friends being none the less influential
among the masses because not in the fashionable world Moreover, the
very popular Mayor of New York, De Witt Clinton, was a hearty admirer
of Paine.So Cheetham's paper suffered sadly, and he opened his guns
on Paine, declaring that in the Revolution he (Paine) "had stuck very
correctly to his pen in a safe retreat," that his "Rights of Man" merely
repeated Locke, and so forth.He also began to denounce France and
applaud England, which led to the belief that, having lost republican
patronage, Cheetham was aiming to get that of England.In a "Reply to Cheetham" (August 21st), Paine met personalities in kind.Cheetham, in his rage for attacking everybody and everything that
is not his own (for he is an ugly-tempered man, and he carries
the evidence of it in the vulgarity and forbiddingness of his
countenance--God has set a mark upon Cain), has attacked me, etc."In
reply to further attacks, Paine printed a piece headed "Cheetham and his
Tory Paper."He said that Cheetham was discovering symptoms of being
the successor of Cullen, _alias_ Carpenter."Like him he is seeking to
involve the United States in a quarrel with France for the benefit of
England."This article caused a duel between the rival editors, Cheetham
and Frank, which seems to have been harmless.Paine wrote a letter
to the _Evening Post_, saying that he had entreated Frank to answer
Cheetham's challenge by declaring that he (Paine) had written the
article and was the man to be called to account.In company Paine
mentioned an opinion expressed by the President in a letter just
received.This got into the papers, and Cheetham declared that the
President could not have so written, and that Paine was intoxicated
when he said so.For this Paine instituted a suit against Cheetham for
slander, but died before any trial.Paine had prevailed with his pen, but a terrible revenge was plotted
against his good name.The farrier William Carver, in whose house he
had lived, turned Judas, and concocted with Cheetham the libels against
Paine that have passed as history.PERSONAL TRAITS

On July 1, 1806, two young English gentlemen, Daniel and William
Constable, arrived in New York, and for some years travelled about the
country.The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his
nephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to
Paine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe
offered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed
a true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was
taking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine's about 5 o'clock, sat about an
hour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me
to-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but
when I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We
were up by five o'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in
commemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against
the sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:
stores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the
honour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished
peaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked
with him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was
walking about Carver's shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old
philosopher, in bed at 4 o'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well
as when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine's papier-mache snuff-box, which
     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,
     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is
     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July
5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print
I left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family
who came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or
noticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old
friend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There
is no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of
culture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of
Paine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they
travelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine
months later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine
from Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent
disagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,
lying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his
actions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But
next day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable
writes:

"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national
defence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and
ships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures
called prophecies, etc.He says
that this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will
not touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine's just then
experimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a
scandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that
thirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had
"the Bible bound up with the 'Age of Reason,' and that they spoke in
very disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his
farm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of
his slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of
intemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to
time for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister
to Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw
persons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there
without fault.Staple, brother of the
influential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine's religious views
by some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at
New Rochelle.Burger, Pelton's clerk, used to drive Paine about
     daily.Vale says:

     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and
     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his
     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and
     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine
     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless
     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean
     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with
     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring
     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing
     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine's dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between
Paine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates
the latter's bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly
and dishonestly treated in Carver's house, and had taken him out of his
Will.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly
never wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him
hardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*

     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of
     Cheetham's book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was
     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned
     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars
     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--
     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any
     person reading Cheetham's life of Paine that [sic] his pen
     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham's
     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a
     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice
     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the
     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then
     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing
     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a
     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the
     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was
     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this
     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.
     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written
for Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver's
letter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the
correspondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years
hanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,
he could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham
had compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham
had obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters
written in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means
to publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical
errours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a
candid and impartial public will not view them 'with a critick's eye.'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine's faulty grammar, which
Carver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own
letter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he
written it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan's.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver
     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for
wich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to
Paine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver's antipathy
to whom arose from his hopes of Paine's property.In reply to Paine's
information, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I
likewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your
mind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to
appear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing
afterwards."Carver's letter
is dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine's life,
for the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame
Bonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine's death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning
Paine's domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts
personally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"
says Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he
wrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this
plain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to
blackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never
made any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made
an effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you
or myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each
other--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place
between us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have
caused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not
more effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,
and Carver, who had flattered Paine's "great mind," in the letter
just quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for
Cheetham's projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to
publish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which
he meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter
had he not written it.All of Cheetham's libels on Paine's life in New
York are amplifications of Carver's insinuations.In describing Cheetham
as "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this
blackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally
the charges relating to Paine's last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux
mansion.In 1891 I
visited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,
finding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated
in the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used
to sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of
his."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a
perfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,
never intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my
grandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she
heard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those
who uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members
of the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau's religious opinions
are I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman
could for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It
certainly was not until some years after his return to America that any
slovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often
remarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was
neglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once
associated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who
need it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always
     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and
     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,
     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I
     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very
     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side
     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French
     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge
     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had
aversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I
have sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the
following conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the
custom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,
which causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the
oft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was
prominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just
after he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and
at public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no
instance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise
Office to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or
intemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America
(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall's
daily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning
everything, but in no case is a word said of Paine's drinking.Paine's enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every
charge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine
told Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private
affliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified
on a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest
friends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected
to follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and
drank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,
where Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to
Caleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less
than any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,
questioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton's store at New Rochelle, and
found that Paine's liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per
week.He also questioned Jarvis, the
artist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five
months, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and
himself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink
much."In July, 1809, just after Paine's death, Cheetham wrote
Barlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his
character," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a
merchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order
of Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of
Washington; he could know nothing of Cheetham's treachery, and fell into
his trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for
granted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about
Paine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,
though strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the
heaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his
former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had
received his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking
down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
their society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he
was, well knew Paine's nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not
from appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a
stock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine
found no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps
discover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness
that threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the
terrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left
Carver's to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the
house of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained
ten months.Hitt reports that Paine's weekly supply then--his
seventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd's "Joel Barlow," p.was one
     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never
     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver's he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor's recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John
Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and
fire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,
and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,
and was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows
was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was
intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to
this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of
wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both
in the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and
irreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant
personal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine's life, that
he never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that
all accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under
all circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,
they said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age
and Paine, like Jefferson, could 'bear but little spirit,' so that he
was constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I
visited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed
with the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was
a drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter
to Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when
he wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;
that Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it
without authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole
course of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him
on religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,
philosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from
their own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their
integrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be
impossible to give."During Paine's life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality
connected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the
following: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in
whose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three
sons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"
Madame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had
betrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to
blackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed
he had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not
actionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville
in court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation
between the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was
preposterous.Cheetham's lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things
that his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine
smile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the
slander.She never saw but
decency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when
Paine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver's
lies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole
story (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine's estate for tuition
of the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,
"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not
have come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for
her children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that
"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,
and Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine's child."But, apart from the
intrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),
Underbill's character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,
Judge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence
but Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead
lips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham's case by saying that
Paine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;
the charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted
from Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to
Paine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to
visit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham's
case was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that
"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or
illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were
alone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects
of Paine's care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that
Paine's Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this
mysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and
disappointed speculators."Sampson's invective was terrific; Cheetham
rose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson
took a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:

"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross
abuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself
a monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a
party, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit
still to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court
against a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does
she deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of
coming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has
lavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten
     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson's speech says that the jury "although
composed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few
minutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:

"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive
his sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
imposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,
with a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,
lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should
receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong
to the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office
by men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the
councils of state."*

     * "Speech of Counsellor Sampson; with an Introduction to
     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret
     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,
     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and
     for other information, to the industrious collector of
     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.

Madame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her
character,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose
children she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an
illustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham's defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a
French woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they
could little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years
had thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals
as the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into
variants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that
Paine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu
Palmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,
etc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose
name Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a
romantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the
execution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young
children in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,
supported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his
property to them when he died.The widow and children lived in
apartments up town by themselves.I believe
his conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared
to be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*

     * "Forty Years' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was
the widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first
brought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth
of the time (1834), and an indication that Paine's generosity to
the Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth
quoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years
afterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it
was whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though
he was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it
has gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of
McClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]
followed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas
Bonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where
he and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by
Paine's self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents
concerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have
been brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except
out of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory
of sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for
the same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of
a home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our
revolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law
of his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,
he could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be
persecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION

The blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle
was heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously
gained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first
advocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were
low, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were
insulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or
two letters to Congress, of which Paine's enemies did not fail to make
the most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for
     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by
some, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,
and did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his
daughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The
only procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and
artfulness.Paine's physician was the most distinguished in New York,
Dr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one
Dr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham's spy.Manly afterwards
contributed to Cheetham's book a lying letter, in which he claimed
to have been Paine's physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame
Bonneville's narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of
his friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,
never saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but
he converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*

     * Another claimant to have been Paine's physician has been
     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham
     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that
     he had been Paine's physician, and witnessed his
     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it
     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine
     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith
     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had
     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever
     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who
     attests his sobriety.Smith is
     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection
     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor
     any item of Wickham's report is mentioned.He said Paine
     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the
ministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The
three alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,
terrible death.Before Paine's arrival in America, the excitement on
his approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an
anticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly
devised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his
arrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,
The Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as
fencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars
for writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the
expedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more
concerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try
something more worthy of a man."*

     * Dr.Francis' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists
were describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind
in Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"
Thomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of
thunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any
sectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine
from his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark
affixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared
to return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was
searched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment
when New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,
Christopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a
few feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author
sat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the
prophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their
antagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine
was spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore
years and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him
represented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred
years ago.Renan thinks
he will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated
Christian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a
Darwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that
he might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel's legend."In 1875, when
he was ill in St Luke's Hospital, New York, he desired me to question
the physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his
fearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he
has died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine's case;
that was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by
the fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton's
world-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the
Presbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and
orthodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:

"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the
Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of
some importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from
a priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter
of no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in
God, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does
not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor
permit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,
almost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade
thrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of
Moses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine's
death-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some
respect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine
was approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*

     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal
     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the
     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were
     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English
     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit
     his (Erving's) father.He heard him say that Paine and he
     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people
     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say
     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville's narrative shows that his
fear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of
Voltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring
priest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to
fear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him
might fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be
left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to
get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without
witnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years
before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic
convictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a
sensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never
told a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly
reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse
Hedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately
thirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the
patient's room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the
Bishop's story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of
any mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one
cannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not
take place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**

     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,
     p.** Bishop Fenwick's narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,
     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be
     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine's adherents were keeping him under the
influence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,
at heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who
had published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the
guillotine.*

     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to
     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the
     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine
     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that
     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject
     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his
     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,
     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and
     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits
     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder
that cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but
his connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they
once idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in
America, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his
biography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last
illness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they
parted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine
only turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to
renew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,
'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition
also, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after
ignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the
"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the
sufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect
with satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food
would stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for
a week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,
and his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death
approached.After the years in which the stories of Paine's wretched
end have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic
lady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a
perfect lady,--that Paine's mind was active to the last, that shortly
before death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died
after a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly
before, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke
about his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame
Bonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received
in her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas
Paine.On June 10th Paine's friends assembled to look on his face for the last
time.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that
of her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;
they could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five
miles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed
Paine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London
Packet:

"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a
gentleman lately returned from a tour: 'On my return from my journey,
when I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom
Paine on the road.The followers were
two <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a
riding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an
Irish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what
funeral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as
his enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends
out by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done
a great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any
purgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil
would let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance
with Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his
horse on a trot, and left me.'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained
Madame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was
Willett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a
good man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine's friends were
glad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all
said about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the
correspondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame
Bonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity
of that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse's head and
followed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,
represented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded
from his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for
the President's intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of
Domingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French
author, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this
country in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next
world with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly
another of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite
Quakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends
refused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,
     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;
but beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic
woman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in
the United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at
the other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,
my son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for
France!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found
in the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:
"Since Mr.Paine's arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way
you very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,
has been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As
to the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious
visitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and
opinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and
with a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him
from those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your
professional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest
and most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing
excelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and
forgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom
he brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,
seemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small
room he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave
with hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him
in 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the
latter end of his life.He

     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,
     Is abandoned in death and interr'd like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some
abuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and
is quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it
branded by the law as the slanderer of a woman's honor, and scourged by
the community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine's death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck
blind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond
his threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The
self-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who
brought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,
nor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine
brought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only
on the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to
recant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded
Paine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire
to be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had
been beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on
Christ?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There
was found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of
Willett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that
she was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord
Jesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has
ever had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book
[the 'Age of Reason']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such
stories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition
of the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities
were printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant
became a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine's
recantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This
     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had
     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of
     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and
     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised
     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that
     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had
     been announced in Paine's obituaries that "some days
     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker
     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but
     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his
     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,
     when Hicks's deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed
     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet's
     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation
     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much
     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no
     object at all!The story was published by one Charles
     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale
     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe
     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection
of Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a
calumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs
surrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book
into the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who
declared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque
superstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,
disgusted thoughtful Christians.*

     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a
     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley
     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his
     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John
     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to
     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of
     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied
     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O'Brian (a
     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,
     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John
     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou 't get thy frying in hell; they 'll roast thee
     like a herring."They 'll put thee in the furnace hot,
     And on thee bar the door:
     How the devils all will laugh
     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine's head, exclaiming,

     "How are the mighty fallen,
     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:
     "Right fol-de-rol, let's dance and sing,
     Tom is dead, God save the king--
     The infidel now low doth lie--
     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,
     "I 'll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine's
heart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his
death, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society
swiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of
Quakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the
separation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded
that "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to
be impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave
of the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those
of any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*

     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William
     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the
     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a
     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock
     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being
     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in
     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip
     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant
     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference
     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:

     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:
     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:
     Where he has gone or how he fares,
     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,
of the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine
rose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one
American religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on
the subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks' region, and mentions
in "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine's friend, Colonel
Fellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:

"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in
Long Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,
earnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my
treasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,
blue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school
gentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;
they used to call him 'Aristides.'I used to chat with him in Tammany
Hall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical
middle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there
was a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for
their work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was
double-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth
and exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine
personally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he
drank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to
think you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement
and the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on
the public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York
he had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his
death a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,
and this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when
the division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett's
conversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the
neighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine's books carefully
and honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine's risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended
recantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the
whole controversy over Paine's works renewed.One after another deist
was sent to prison for publishing Paine's works, the last being Richard
Carlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett
carried Paine's bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely
for this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of
L1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal
victory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that
wealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet
Street, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile's petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the
whole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive
deist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally
atheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by
     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot
     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-
     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in
     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and
     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,
     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a
     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a
     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at
     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner
     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in
     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of
     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,
     Superstition being described as holding

     "in vassalage a doating World,
     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,
     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were
entering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"
were but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations
pronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"
was the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity
diabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country
or any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their
opinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer
Shelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by
Shelley in the struggle for the Englishman's right to read Paine.If
any enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the
godlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for
their opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine
was in every word of Shelley's letter to Lord Ellenborough on the
punishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*

     * "Whence is any right derived, but that which power
     confers, for persecution?Eaton
     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might
     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could
     not believe them except you should make them credible, which
     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God
     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the
     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less
     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does
     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity
     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the
     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,
     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert
     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
     disbelieved the divinity of Christ's mission?...The
     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may
     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the
     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in
     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive
     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and
     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and
again has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on
honest thinkers.In Paine's time the phantasm which was called Jehovah
represented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the
revelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,
slander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented
as crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine's dead
body, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was
proved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who
out-reasoned them.Paine's fidelity to his unanswered argument was
fatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without
reason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"
mainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but
through certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine's peaceful
death, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming
his Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age
of Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,
also a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his
posthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an
organ called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local
organization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge
Hertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected
a monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be
said of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and
forms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The
real cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical
barbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine's bones appear like some page of Mosaic
mythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine's
coffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool
     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was
     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal
     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks
     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with
     Cobbett's effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The
     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they
     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed
     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,
     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas
     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie
     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and
     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent
     inquiries.Of
     Paine's gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his
     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In
     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle
     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to
Cobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on
the island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and
shipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett
gave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.'I
have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:
you have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done
myself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New
Rochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When
I myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of
the great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and
Manchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will
effect the reformation of England in Church and State.'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett's workmen
while they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that
Paine's little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once
small movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused
him a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,
no man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world
which he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been
born in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that
heart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter
of fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the
papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary
of Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,
November 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become
the citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for
America.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary
talents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted
with the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of
the French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He
thus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George
Chalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the
statements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in
Philadelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had
been deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
published in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was
"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted
the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the
next year.The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and his _Register_
was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,
because he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age
having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical
politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are
generously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her
nephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his
intention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with
Madame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame
Bonneville had been disposing of some of Paine's manuscripts, such as
that on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in
_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her
husband's assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the
"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et
l'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her
a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important
letters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)
her conditions, that it should be published in England, without any
addition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or
all of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing
except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by
brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame
Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
letters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists
among the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,
where they kept a small book shop.His biography
in Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that
in 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous
papers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained
the manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville
emigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,
lived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,
and to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal
Cheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with
the result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett
did not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such
conditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that
were never sent.The recollections are those of both M.
and Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out
the parts that represent Madame's personal knowledge and reminiscences,
as Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with
characteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important
points.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do
beyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters
indicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,
etc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by
any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
still a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
from his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is
reserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the
characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor
of Bonneville's surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
editing the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This
was Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused
his denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now
wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
of the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,
in the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy
of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against
royalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising
his benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against
Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and
arrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the
police his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by
Fouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,
and that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,
America."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were
connected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due
to their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards
the close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to
his widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do
for a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published
heresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
tracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,
that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
County of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that
his father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that
his mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged
to the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards
became a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,
as appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a
     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed
     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man
     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made
     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,
     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction
     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the
     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,
     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have
     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the
statement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the
free-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen
years of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a
year afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:
that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he
afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759
and 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher
to a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and
separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*

     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories
     require revision by the light of the careful researches made
     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this
     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from
England for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his
history; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever
we find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d'un
grand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge
of a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might
have been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was
quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,
and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They
disliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of
grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was
reconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived
them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of
hostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the
parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no
thoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had
any talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have
continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them
into action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy
wished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just
set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was
time for every man to stir."*

     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for
young ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then
little known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he
undertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
slavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also
stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he
joined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history
of the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:
[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one
else-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]

When Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine
published the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every
corporal's guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members
of the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in
number, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in
all directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,
owing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the
robberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the
Congress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed
for France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the
Congress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he
received the following letter from Col.Laurens:

"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention
my horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by
mismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and
I am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat
your acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in
bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with
open arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are
anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
particular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common
between us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
and published.Nathaniel Greene:

"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you
into this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome
acknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think
you have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few
characters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and
not to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for
your writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;
nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride
and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation
happy."'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
useful to the country.**

At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,
Bordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had
bought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,
Bordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
received in the same month.He carried with him the model of
a bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in
a drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he
went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went
to Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge
was cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas
Paine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,
1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the
Rights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to
about a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,
McDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two
Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and
of Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the
following letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de
Sechelles:

"To Thomas Paine:

"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire
among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences
of those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that
Common Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
conception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen
with pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate
authority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before
you were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an
observer and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people
who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword
of the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens
turned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and
collects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of
genius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to
give to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty
and happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the
first to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that
honour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of
your election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at
Mr.Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure
of knowing you."Herault,

"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine
at the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,
gave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,
though a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not
forget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United
States of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude
would not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of
Louis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**

     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when
the greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
retired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy
against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of
some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
their horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined
themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
most valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed
himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he
could not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly
destined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked
enemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed
among the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the
Luxembourg in December 1793.|

From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,
for a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre
took place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote
to Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter
to Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter
from Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote
a memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he
_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months
of imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially
offered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called
him to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he
alleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
Aristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared
     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some
     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:

"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind
visit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,
however, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your
being set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,
who arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment's
consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my
life remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected
me, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am
exceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from
her who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of
citizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,
nor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,

"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
of the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to
Gen.Monroe entreated him not to
send it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was
afterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him
with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity
of a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when
he was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless
child who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was
the famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his
side.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being
very sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent
nurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account
in itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and
kindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]
Committee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read
it in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and
published in London; but, the language of the author has been changed
by the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of
Finance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
Washington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a
newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
the same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and
who wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore
we suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in
doing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the
Convention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,
October 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of
Reason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did
not, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great
number of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore
came back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13
April 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr.B.
spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a
reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a
week or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was
occupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;
and Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
bed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting
at meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from
which, though he understood but little of the French language when
spoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating
to politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his
morning's reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,
and they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by
the bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on
foot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not
believe he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of
his stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a
wholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than
that they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical
invention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without
his receiving many visits.Smith [Sir
Robert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;
and, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great
reputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors
with civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation
was mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to
him, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain
themselves with their own ideas.Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house
in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here
learnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out
after dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or
three hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he
often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was
seldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by
seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his
countrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always
performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely
means to secure success.He wrote as
follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment
of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine
published, on this occasion, a letter to C.*

     * The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are
     here crossed out by Madame Bonneville.258
     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a
bridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been
adopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He
employed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to
high perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,
and according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/
moulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the
form that he required.Though
he fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce
arguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often
demonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone
in doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his
bridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of
hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be
sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied
without admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and
were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his bridge:
come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as
to please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw
the sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in
the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy
compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he
had executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine
being put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed
boards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification
of the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together
with a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at
Washington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to
obtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of
Madam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial
on the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the
two pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon
Bridges.--Upon Iron Bridges.--To the Directory.--Memoir on the Progress
and Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of
Talma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at
Brussells.--The Ca-ira of America.--To the Consul Lepeaux.*

     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed
     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of
     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
see Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of
the Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he
got up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave
the mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your
religion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville's journal
(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*

     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several
     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with
     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith's
[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he
was neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it
was not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air
to the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with
the following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry
than the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be
gallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs
to the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new
covenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little
Corner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is
agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real
republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly
grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the
six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
that he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of
great consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit
France; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,
many of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure
of Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,
relying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America
justified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked
at Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of
Baltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he
landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but
a few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters
to the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter
of 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,
where a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City
Hotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some
friends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The
letter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
accepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of
paralytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had
the same while at Mr.Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from
prison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of
the winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the
spring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm
for 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill
for fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which
Paine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and
other necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
to cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
place, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,
on Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr.Paine being in his
room, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the
window.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,
and all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day
discovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,
fell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,
and left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and
there (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the
muzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that
Christopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening
before, and had returned it again before six o'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately
and voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;
and Derick was acquitted.*

     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in
     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New
     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being
a citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The
letters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80
of this volume_..]

This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as
his legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an
undoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
made him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:

"My dear Bonneville: Why don't you come to America Your wife and two
boys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak
English very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide
for the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by
Madget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English
woman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
Institute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:

"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also
the letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written
to the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to
interest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of
your coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
American Minister from Mr.As soon as you
receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of
the proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,
who succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting
the iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what
vessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best
place to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may
contrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the
Spring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often
less."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,
Gregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I
have yet in manuscript, by subscription."*

     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame
     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true
     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a
     slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory.The minister who
     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The
     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary
     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to
     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
called, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great
importance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;
and Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,
said: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to
tell you, that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you 'll be
dammed.""Poh, poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with
such an impertinent message.God would not send
such a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;
be off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
New York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had
in 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
increased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a
memorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for
his services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on
the same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as
follows.*

     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking
     oat Cobbett's words, "will be found in the Appendix."The
     documents and letters are not given, but they are well
     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,
passed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave
to withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He
was deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing
himself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were
greatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,
while he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a
very great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no
interest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them
another will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his
friend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also
altered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before
his death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and
gave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it
than any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a
member of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we
were looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs
of our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his
affairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;
his father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a
grave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which
he seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the
interview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be
buried on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the
farm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half
rotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I
assure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be
sold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I
have been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between
my children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
whereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously
recommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I
am dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time
after, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of
sorrow, "you will have nothing left."*

     * Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton
     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a
     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a
     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide
     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,
     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance
     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South
     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given
     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and
     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to
     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them
     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct
     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At
     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father
     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in
     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his
     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of
     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone
     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and
     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides
     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and
     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I
     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I
     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect
     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,
     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas
     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no
     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much
     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes
     me that so little is known of Paine's benefactions, that
     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that
     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French
     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the
     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to
     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily
departed from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in
bed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes
write.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the
newspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the
press after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took
great interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always
so strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He
never complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of
his sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged
to sustain during his illness, in a carman's house [Ryder's] in a small
village [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose
confidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of
his sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;
but, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are
nothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and
you don't come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this
time, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever
returned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high
price for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This
must be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the
neighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,
after which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble
about anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though
Dr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had
commenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been
so officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless
he was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The
next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and
they resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his
death, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don't think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is
you Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such
business.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly
diminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had
     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;
     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine
     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even
     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and
to talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good
morning."One of his friends
came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom
seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,
if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,
upon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but
they were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to
the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed
so much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent
the night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock,
after a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from
the city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a
portrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was
executed.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany
coffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the
coffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck
and wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put
under his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the
coffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose
in my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not
disfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was
not wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,
oh, lord help me!He
groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered
the question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;
but the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,
walking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he
was desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be
the place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in
execution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the
following inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died
the eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall
twelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been
planted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many
persons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in
memory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain
these memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have
been put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been
written on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the
farm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
feeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,
I, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My
son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for
France!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and
philosopher!**

     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been
     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,
     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of
     Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on
     Paine's grave.It is satisfactory to find another
     interpretation.** Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave
     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,
     introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine with the words: "as
     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham
     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine's]
     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for
     carrying the dead, to Potter's Field; a white man drove the
     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole
     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's Field.Such
     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an
acre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been
sold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,
which was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in
lots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece
of land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine's posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer
to Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces
on Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous
political works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences
cannot be, as yet, published.*

In _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of
a machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the
Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
disorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that
it was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding
him as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character
according to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
about five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;
and his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;
in which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of
reproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told
us that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to
deceive him].***

     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,
     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as
     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of
     Paine's bridges.In this paragraph and some
     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,
     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an
affectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and
foot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or
affectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with
his hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His
countenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving
salutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he
did not begin with "how d' ye do?"If they had
none, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his
eye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened
to over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their
paper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of
jobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the
sure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,
concealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret
pay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or
private meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he
longed for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he
added that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,
beforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would
take place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the
clear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not
for him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past
and consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to
open day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,
and with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is
almost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,
whom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the
clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he
wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his
vehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place
where you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to
envy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he
thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do
you think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General
Gates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have
always had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you
were married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General
went on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent
questions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
wailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking
of the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did
they go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and
settled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice
and in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the
manly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow's letter [i. e. to
     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him
he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of
a treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
him.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully
seized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular
traits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of
witticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in
the same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place
where he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it
too circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions
well brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes
of which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,
rendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more
endearing.Politics were his favorite subject
He never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never
disputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could
understand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it
when on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke
on dramatic subjects.He did
not like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the
mind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the
affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political
discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he
was always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his
pamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and
steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an
instant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who
listens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his
contemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which
makes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas
Paine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited
the Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in
spite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame
Bonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer
of Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
Cobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS

In 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated
from Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,
who found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,
Dr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall's
journals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers
are of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall's entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never
dreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely
been secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by
this work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the
excellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in
New Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the
relatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,
merits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the
exhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is
amongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board
the same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their
acquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides
now in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him
before it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is
sure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his
circumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for
him he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us
of his coming this day.Kerbright

visitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert
Morris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is
mentioned.]Franklin today;

suppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy
fearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to
bed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of
machine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme
to H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused
saint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,
but I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John
     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of
     much interest.The first steamer seems
     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka

to see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common

and shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose
family I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home

another class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a

other.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c. My Employer has
_Common Sense enough_ to disbelieve most of the Common Systematic
Theories of Divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself.The
Colonel [Kirkbride] is as Free as John Coltman.[Under date of New York, July 31st, Hall writes an account of a journey
with Paine to Morrisania, to visit Gen.Morris, and afterwards to the
farm at New Rochelle, of which he gives particulars already known to my
reader.]Letter of Paine to John Hall, at Capt.Coltman's, in Letitia Court,
Market St, between Front and Second St.Philadelphia:

"Bordentown, Sep.22, 1786.--Old Friend: In the first place I have
settled with Mr.Gordon for the time he has been in the house--in the
second I have put Mrs.Read who, you know has part of our house Col.Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession by putting
part of her goods into it.* By this means we shall have room at our
house (Col.Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations.As Philadelphia
is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm.Foulke's would
not be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you
here.Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the
choice of both her and Col.I wish you could
come up to-morrow (Sunday) and bring the iron with you.I shall be

the elections are over, but we can make a beginning here and what more

Undated letter of Paine to John Hall, in Philadelphia:

"Fryday Noon.--Old Friend: Inclosed (as the man said by the horse) I
send you the battau, as I wish to present it as neat and clean as can be
done; I commit it to your care.The sooner it is got on Board the vessel
the better.I shall set off from here on Monday and expect to be in New
York on Tuesday.I shall take all the tools that are here with me and
wish you would take some with you, that if we should get on a working
fit we may have some to work with.Let me hear from you by the Sunday's
boat and send me the name of the vessel and Captain you go with and what
owners they belong to at New York, or what merchants they go to.I wrote
to you by the last boat, and Peter tells me he gave the letter to Capt.Haines, but Joe says that he enquired for letters and was told there was
none--wishing you an agreeable voyage and meeting at New York, I am your
friend, and humble servant.Kirkbride's and Polly's compt."3 (1786) "Dashwood Park, of Captain Roberts: On
Thursday morning early Sept.28th I took the stage wagon for Trenton.Jo
had gone up by water the day before to a sale of land and a very capital
iron works and nailing with a large corn mill.It was a fair sale there
was a forge and rolling and slitting mill upon an extensive scale the
man has failed--The works with about 60 or 70 acres of land were sold
for L9000 currency.Then was put up about 400 acres of land and sold for
L2700 currency and I believe a good bargain; and bought by a friend of
mine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it
when he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and
they came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys
to find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to
Bordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine's purchase along
with him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble's applying to
Dr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation
having formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and
wished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that
Britain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King
a million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth
overshoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove
stand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine's desire and found it kept my feet
warm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine's
horse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold
and silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and
punching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride
and Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about
the Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments
again and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?
]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,
and when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong
cords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the
other.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that
and words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when
I left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill
used in this affair.We arrived
in town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went
down to Dr.Franklin's, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called
on me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of
the value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of
any of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of
Doctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed
for power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that
he had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed
as nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them
and helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to
examine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency
for the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would
require,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed
until tomorrow.Pain's letter read, and leave given to exhibit the
Bridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]
upon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk
beyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus
is.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a
dispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were
very high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the
Bank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a
reflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable
time, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went
down; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and
what he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with
the several parties.Pain in some things
relating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground
when any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in
difficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The
Captain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying
the model to the State House.Franklin's and fetched the
Bridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and
there placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this
Speaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an
early riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until
he came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker
inspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen
and even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as
different as their features.The philosopher said it would add new
light to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)
remarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by
stand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and
all the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by
an Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt
and realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13
feet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the
world's present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly
for a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to
be put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the
interest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have
erected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more
than pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal
stockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;
I gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day's work and a pair of
gloves.Paine's boy called on time to [inquire] of the money
spent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several
visitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.

Sunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine's horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy
country arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o'clock for dinner.This
is the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street
with a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,
so followed him up to Collins's, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight's Tavern, and
there he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going
for England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th
instant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in
and he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return
on meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee's
proceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had
sent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to
the Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in
France.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full
of employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors
on State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,
could hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he
considers Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to
write by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons
above.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen
letters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the
Doctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of
many aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the
treaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding
an article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability
of it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the
French minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he
would make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were
so fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint
from a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by
endeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from
amongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity
was as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as
necessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many
more hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then
shook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,
Leicester, England:

"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that
he has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he
think I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did
not I send you word it was General Washington's.And does he think I
shall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him
the first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my
setting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I 'll
haul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New
Jersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their
chairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend's
one Mrs.Morgan's and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of
a servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;
he walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and
some plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done
in their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was
necessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would
lend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as
related to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I
believe that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested
miracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to
deem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for
these 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington's great
coat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said
coat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should
expect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having
a chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,
and sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime
hence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be
disputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date
and of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard
to them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for
the above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I
strictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If
not------

"My best wishes to you all,

"John Hall."John
Coltman's, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear
that our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has
been put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now
taken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel
furnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of
iron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded
with six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present
I am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work
(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce
something one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but
there is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of
John Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was
done before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest
run of anything ever published in this country, at least of late
years--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty
thousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now
gone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been
applied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but
I intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have
handsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand
copies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I
do not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at
St.Jefferson who mentioned
the great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who
has brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote
under the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for
me from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me
(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before
you leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P. S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst.it which is more than I have done by any other--were I to ans.all the letters I receive--I should require half a dozen clerks."Extracts from John Hall's letters from London, England: London, January
1792 Burke's publication has produced one way or other near 50 different
answers and publications.Nothing of late ever has been so read as
Paine's answer.Sometime shortly he will publish a second part of the
Rights of Man.His first part was scrutinized by the Privy Council
held on purpose and through fear of making him more popular deemed too
contemptible for Government notice.The sale of it for a day or two was
rather retarded or not publickly disposed of until it was known by the
printers that it would not be noticed by Government.John Hall to a friend in England:

"London, Nov.I dined yesterday with the Revolution Society at
the London Tavern.A very large company assembled and after dinner
many truly noble and patriotic toasts were drank.The most prominent
were--The Rights of Man--with 3 times &c.--The Revolution of France--The
Revolution of the World--May all the armies of tyrants learn the
Brunswick March--May the tree of Liberty be planted in every tyrant
city, and may it be an evergreen.The utmost unanimity prevailed through
the company, and several very excellent songs in favor of Liberty
were sung.Every bosom felt the divine glow of patriotism and love
of universal freedom.For my part I was
transported at the scene.It happened that a company of Aristocratic
french and Spanish merchants were met in the very room under, and
Horne Tooke got up and sarcastically requested the company not to wound
the tender feelings of the gentlemen by too much festivity.This sarcasm
was followed by such a burst of applause as I never before heard."From J. Redman, London, Tuesday Dec.18, 5 p. m. to John Hall,
Leicester, England: "Mr.Erskine
shone like the morning-Star.The instant Erskine
closed his speech the venal jury interrupted the Attorney General, who
was about to make a reply, and without waiting for any answer, or any
summing up by the Judge, pronounced him guilty.Such an instance of
infernal corruption is scarcely upon record.I have not time to express
my indignant feelings on this occasion.At this moment, while I write,
the mob is drawing Erskine's carriage home, he riding in triumph--his
horses led by another party.Riots at Cambridge, Manchester, Bridport
Dorset &c.&c. O England, how art thou fallen!I am just now told that
press warrants are issued today.[John Hall's London Journal (1792) records frequent meetings there with
Paine.Paine going to dress on an invitation to dine
with the Athenians.He leaves town for a few days to see his aunt."Paine goes out of town tomorrow to compose what I call
Burke's Funeral Sermon."Paine looking well and in high
spirits."Does not seem to
talk much, rather on a reserve, of the prospect of political affairs.He had a letter from G. Washington and Jefferson by the ambassador
[Pinckney]."The majority of entries merely mention meeting Paine, whose
name, by the way, after the prosecution was instituted, Hall prudently
writes "P------n."He also tells the story of Burke's pension.]Had a ride to Bordentown to see Mr.He was well and appeared jollyer than I had ever known him.He is full of whims and schemes and mechanical inventions, and is to
build a place or shop to carry them into execution, and wants my help."APPENDIX C. PORTRAITS OF PAINE

At the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but
after his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height
was five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,
it is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine's mouth was
delicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble
with age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head
long, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man
who has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation
on the brilliancy of Paine's eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its
elegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he
is shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may
judge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,
on which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an
unwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a
death-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used
on the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some
idea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture
said to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in
Philadelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,
for Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard
University, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted
another portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There
must have been an early engraving from one of Peale's pictures, for John
Hall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my
friends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,
but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis
portrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of
Philadelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of
Man," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand
and pens rests Paine's right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The
full face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of
the queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress
is neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it
is rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large
wristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with
     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a
     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him
a note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,
concerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not
as a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the
disposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have
possessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I
incline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now
in this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical
portraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,
Robespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille
Desmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These
pictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France
during the Revolution.Lowry, of
South Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At
the beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at
Williamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed
to Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,
until purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of
Syracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been
begun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of
Paine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture
is about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an
elegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from
the knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the
same room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that
further light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville
Paine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,
the publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in
1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is
described in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would
mean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly
in December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,
however, have been then taken, on account of Paine's imprisonment and
illness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to
reside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable
picture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and
expressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical
with that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George
Romney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_
after the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up
in Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp's
engraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the
smaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for
Cheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not
to have got into Gilbert Vale's popular biography of Paine.That and
a reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine's works, have
spread through this country something little better than a caricature;
and one Sweden has subjected Truelove's edition, in England, to a
like misfortune.Paine's friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were
satisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake's
library a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back
by Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all
his vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as
it is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville
found in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter's "History of England,"
and published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,
Paine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights
of Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked
"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good

A miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.
Mackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British
Library, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it
"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in
Vale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace
of its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have
been made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for
popular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily
long, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical
leader.Before speaking of Jarvis' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later
one by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my
collection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his
death.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.
W. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born
at Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New
York, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the
Americas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a
dove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book
inscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll
with "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays
break out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the
balances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the
United States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,
crown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a
plumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by
a pen, on Paine's breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom's
Wreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The
wreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following
names: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;
Barlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.
Home Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,
as compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent
expression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of
the original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily
have fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for
Paine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the
impression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two
years later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I
saw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It
reveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man's
power.After Paine's death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence
Hutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the
establishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used
by George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the
bust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in
the New York Historical Society's rooms.In an article on Paine in the
_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden
by the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an
Investigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the
statement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire
collection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but
from no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The
face is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal
misrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except
that in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of
Paine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies
convince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John
Wesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of
New York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to
be a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an
inscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine
now in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been
engraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only
can convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing
the strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now
drawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now
flushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,
the firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol.2 is a perspective view of a common epaulement converted into a
Rocket battery.In this case, as the epaulement is not of sufficient
length to support the Rocket and stick, holes must be bored in the
ground, with a miner’s borer, of a sufficient depth to receive the
sticks, and at such distances, and such an angle, as it is intended
to place the Rockets for firing.The inside of the epaulement must be
pared away to correspond with this angle, say 55°.The Rockets are then
to be laid in embrasures, formed in the bank, as in the last case.Where the ground is such as to admit of using the borer, this latter
system, of course, is the easiest operation; and for such ground as
would be likely to crumble into the holes, slight tubes are provided,
about two feet long, to preserve the opening; in fact, these tubes will
be found advantageous in all ground.2 also shews a powerful mode of defending a field work by means of
Rockets, in addition to the defences of the present system; merely by
cutting embrasures in the glacis, for horizontal firing.[Illustration: _Plate 7_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




A ROCKET AMBUSCADE.1, represents one of the most important uses that can be
made of Rockets for field service; it is that of the Rocket Ambuscade
for the defence of a pass, or for covering the retreat of an army,
by placing any number, hundreds or thousands, of 32 or 24-pounder
shell Rockets, or of 32-pounder Rockets, armed with 18-pounder shot,
limited as to quantity only by the importance of the object, which
is to be obtained; as by this means, the most extensive destruction,
even amounting to annihilation, may be carried amongst the ranks of an
advancing enemy, and that with the exposure of scarcely an individual.The Rockets are laid in rows or batteries of 100 or 500 in a row,
according to the extent of ground to be protected.They are to be
concealed either in high grass, or masked in any other convenient
way; and the ambuscade may be formed of any required number of these
batteries, one behind the other, each battery being prepared to be
discharged in a volley, by leaders of quick match: so that one man is,
in fact, alone sufficient to fire the whole in succession, beginning
with that nearest to the enemy, as soon as he shall have perceived
them near enough to warrant his firing.Where the batteries are very
extensive, each battery may be sub-divided into smaller parts, with
separate trains to each, so that the whole, or any particular division
of each battery, may be fired, according to the number and position of
the enemy advancing.Trains, or leaders, are provided for this service,
of a particular construction, being a sort of flannel saucissons,
with two or three threads of slow match, which will strike laterally
at all points, and are therefore very easy of application; requiring
only to be passed from Rocket to Rocket, crossing the vents, by which
arrangement the fire running along, from vent to vent, is sure to
strike every Rocket in quick succession, without their disturbing each
others’ direction in going off, which they might otherwise do, being
placed within 18 inches apart, if all were positively fired at the same
instant.2 is a somewhat similar application, but not so much in the nature
of an ambuscade as of an open defence.Here a very low work is thrown
up, for the defence of a post, or of a chain of posts, consisting
merely of as much earth and turf as is sufficient to form the sides of
shallow embrasures for the large Rockets, placed from two to three feet
apart, or nearer; from which the Rockets are supposed to be discharged
independently, by a certain number of artillery-men, employed to keep
up the fire, according to the necessity of the case.It is evident, that by this mode, an incessant and tremendous fire may
be maintained, which it would be next to impossible for an advancing
enemy to pass through, not only from its quantity and the weight and
destructive nature of the ammunition, but from the closeness of its
lines and its contiguity to the ground; leaving, in fact, no space in
front which must not be passed over and ploughed up after very few
rounds.As both these operations are supposed to be employed in defensive
warfare, and therefore in fixed stations, there is no difficulty
involved in the establishment of a sufficient depôt of ammunition for
carrying them on upon the most extensive scale; though it is obviously
impossible to accomplish any thing approaching this system of defence,
by the ordinary means of artillery.[Illustration: _Plate 8_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF FORTIFIED PLACES.1, represents the advanced batteries and approaches in
the attack of some fortress, where an imperfect breach being supposed
to have been made in the salient angle of any bastion, large Rockets,
weighing each from two to three hundred weight or more, and being each
loaded with not less than a barrel of powder, are fired into the ruins
after the revetment is broken, in order, by continual explosions, to
render the breach practicable in the most expeditious way.To insure
every Rocket that is fired having the desired effect, they are so
heavily laden, as not to rise off the ground when fired along it; and
under these circumstances are placed in a small shallow trench, run
along to the foot of the glacis, from the nearest point of the third
parallel, and in a direct line for the breach: by this means, the
Rockets being laid in this trench will invariably pursue exactly the
same course, and every one of them will be infallibly lodged in the
breach.It is evident, that the whole of this is intended as a night
operation, and a few hours would suffice, not only for running forward
the trench, which need not be more than 18 inches deep, and about nine
inches wide, undiscovered, but also for firing a sufficient number of
Rockets to make a most complete breach before the enemy could take
means to prevent the combinations of the operation.From the experiments I have lately made, I have reason to believe, that
Rockets much larger than those above mentioned may be formed for this
description of service--Rockets from half a ton to a ton weight; which
being driven in very strong and massive cast iron cases, may possess
such strength and force, that, being fired by a process similar to
that above described, even against the revetment of any fortress,
unimpaired by a cannonade, it shall, by its mass and form, pierce the
same; and having pierced it, shall, with one explosion of several
barrels of powder, blow such portion of the masonry into the ditch, as
shall, with very few rounds, complete a practicable breach.It is evident, from this view of the weapon, that the Rocket System is
not only capable of a degree of portability, and facility for light
movements, which no weapon possesses, but that its ponderous parts, or
the individual masses of its ammunition, also greatly exceed those of
ordinary artillery.And yet, although this last description of Rocket
ammunition appears of an enormous mass, as ammunition, still if it be
found capable of the powers here supposed, of which _I_ have little
doubt, the whole weight to be brought in this way against any town, for
the accomplishment of a breach, will bear _no comparison_ whatever to
the weight of ammunition now required for the same service, independent
of the saving of time and expense, and the great comparative simplicity
of the approaches and works required for a siege carried on upon this
system.This class of Rockets I propose to denominate the _Belier a
feù_.2 represents the converse of this system, or the use of these
larger Rockets for the defence of a fortress by the demolition of the
batteries erected against it.In this case, the Rockets are fired from
embrasures, in the crest of the glacis, along trenches cut a part of
the way in the direction of the works to be demolished.[Illustration: _Plate 9_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




OF THE USE OF ROCKETS BY INFANTRY AGAINST CAVALRY, AND IN COVERING THE
STORMING OF A FORTRESS.1, represents an attack of cavalry against infantry,
repulsed by the use of Rockets.These Rockets are supposed to be of the
lightest nature, 12 or 9-pounders, carried on bat horses or in small
tumbrils, or with 6-pounder shell Rockets, of which one man is capable
of carrying six in a bundle, for any peculiar service; or so arranged,
that the flank companies of every regiment may be armed, each man, with
such a Rocket, in addition to his carbine or rifle, the Rocket being
contained in a small leather case, attached to his cartouch, slinging
the carbine or rifle, and carrying the stick on his shoulder, serving
him either as a spear, by being made to receive the bayonet, or as a
rest for his piece.By this means every battalion would possess a powerful battery of
this ammunition, _in addition_ to all its ordinary means of attack
and defence, and with scarcely any additional burthen to the flank
companies, the whole weight of the Rocket and stick not exceeding six
pounds, and the difference between the weight of a rifle and that of a
musket being about equivalent.As to the mode of using them in action,
for firing at long ranges, as these Rockets are capable of a range of
2,000 yards, a few portable frames might be carried by each regiment,
without any incumbrance, the frames for this description of Rocket not
being heavier than a musket; but as the true intention of the arm, in
this distribution of it, is principally for close quarters, either
in case of a charge of cavalry, or even of infantry, it is generally
supposed to be fired in vollies, merely laid on the ground, as in
the Plate here described.And, as it is well known, how successfully
charges of cavalry are frequently sustained by infantry, even by the
fire of the musket alone, it is not presuming too much to infer, that
the repulse of cavalry would be _absolutely certain_, by masses of
infantry, possessing the additional aid of powerful vollies of these
shell Rockets.So also in charges of infantry, whether the battalion so
armed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley
of one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank
companies, must produce the most decisive effects.Neither can it be
doubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might
make the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their
rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur manœuvres.In
like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,
or for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such
occasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as
shewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark
that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited
than the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by
means of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both
carcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from
the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of
the third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or
three vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the
storming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest
stress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not
therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket
carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as
the 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the
10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a
Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell
thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_
throwing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the
_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question
that an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,
is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of
ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow
succession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,
and a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the
general basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due
proportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be
attained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to
exceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily
        produce more destruction than when they happen in
        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as
        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of
fortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is
the only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried
into a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets
may accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is
infinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would
enable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only
to scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or
passage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;
but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,
while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as
to the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets.The
frame is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of
the legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for
which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,
therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,
each of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it
with the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by
the haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the
frame being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into
the stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by
a trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men
are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail
set, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually
prevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to
the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;
it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself
discharged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a
six-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is
evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as
well as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or
tanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and
an attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as
from its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is
no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the
marine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the
burthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,
so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the
point of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:
insomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest
mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the
smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell
Rockets recochét in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is
another use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be
passed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a
ship by boarding.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short
stick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the
Rocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with
10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes
are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by
hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,
so as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual
destruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst
the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by
the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect
has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when
they enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER
SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;
by which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these
ships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending
entirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided
in the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and
shell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly
close together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and
top-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives
for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these
racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents
uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which
can be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged
merely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a
considerable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen
to the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will
have returned into safety before any discharge takes place.It is
evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be
calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the
fire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in
the most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to
have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it
is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with
clouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power
of destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass
harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats
in towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely
precluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any
boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth
shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had
an opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French
Fleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was
ascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it
in the enemy.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire
Rockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every
vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the
gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the
smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;
the sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either
by iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the
Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,
as shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and
frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of
war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all
positions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any
possibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these
ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for
bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,
are capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even
24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description
of small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for
general service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be
fitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described
in Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or
the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a
small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside
of the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small
vessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not
carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:
it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore
OWEN’s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and
some with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig.4]




ROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition
which have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion
Rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell
Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and
light natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number
of inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the
24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to
the 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are
from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,
or bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks
are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in
the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in
each case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole
of this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same
facility as the medium and light parts.These Rockets are fired from
bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;
or they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may
also be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the
purposes of explosion.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less
diameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are
therefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the
demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been
realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not
its only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses
than can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project
which, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,
mortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers
of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to
specify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally
used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of
bombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders
them in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them
as medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds
of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and
may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,
either for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations
of three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks
in the centre also strongly bound together.The great art of firing
these _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by
priming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of
powder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42
and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the
32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch
howitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the
least Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed
either with shot or shell, for field service.The 24-pounder Rocket is
very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the
saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly
equal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,
is armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a
6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder
with a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast
expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing
the resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description
of case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity
of musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the
Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained
in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be
given in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates
the balls.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained
in a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in
the shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,
are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be
instantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,
by a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the
bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the
Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden
fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can
be necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is
regulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving
any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden
fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By
this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a
facility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar
operations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient
length for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they
are made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose
issuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell
and case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the
mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,
according to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements
used for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of
different sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they
belong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to
accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into
the stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix
it immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not
hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the
different natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of
speculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter
found a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or
projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of
combining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively
a shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the
Rocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is
required at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be
carried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as
in Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by
a slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the
air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the
parachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended
in the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will
continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere
for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will
float in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived
and unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the
disengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is
not only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every
Rocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal
case, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage
from humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board
of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less
than eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to
render them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere
expense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,
case, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable
as ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1–15]

CONCLUSION.Calculations proving the comparative Economy of the Rocket Ammunition,
both as to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the
expense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true
understanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest
mode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the
field.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,
which has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with
the 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._

If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used
instead of manual labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be
reduced four-fifths, which would lower the amount to about 18_s._
each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted, which I am
endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of
the projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the
comparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of
the charge of powder required to convey it the same distance._s._  _d._

So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an
actual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains
more composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing
any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and
that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together
with the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of
throwing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the
use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed £5; and indeed,
on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that
a transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with
every thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while
on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the
requisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need
specifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,
when compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch
spherical carcass costs £1.17_s._ 11½_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the
32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, does not cost more than £1.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case
there is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11½_d._ Now the large
Rocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the
difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the
different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least
double, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the
other comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15
to 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in
the first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate
economy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to
the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than £3.10_s._ that is to
say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,
though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration
are half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is
evident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets
may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling
mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch
shell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or
conflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the
first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a
comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the
Rocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.His voice was almost gay; there was no touch of reproach in it."The secret is not mine, Gabriel," she said, and she allowed him to
pass his arm around her; her head sank upon his breast."When you know
all, you will approve," she murmured."As I trust you, so must you
trust me."Their lips met; perfect confidence and faith were established between
them, although on Lauretta's side there had been no shadow on the love
she gave him.It was late in the afternoon when Carew was informed that Father
Daniel wished to speak to him privately.He kissed Lauretta and went
out to the priest, in whose face he saw a new horror."I should be the first to tell them," said Father Daniel in a husky
voice, "but I am not yet strong enough."No," replied the priest, "but Eric is.I would not have him removed
until the magistrate, who is absent and has been sent for, arrives.In a state of wonder Carew accompanied Father Daniel out of Doctor
Louis's house, and the priest led the way to the woods."We have passed the
house in which the brothers live."The sun was setting, and the light was quivering on the tops of the
distant trees.Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew plunged into the woods.There were scouts on the outskirts, to whom the priest said, "Has the
magistrate arrived?""No, father," was the answer, "we expect him every moment."From that moment until they arrived at the spot to which Father Daniel
led him, Carew was silent.What had passed between him and Lauretta
had so filled his soul with happiness that he bestowed but little
thought upon a vulgar intrigue between a peasant girl and men whom he
had long since condemned.They no longer troubled him; they had passed
for ever out of his life, and his heart was at rest.Father Daniel and
he walked some distance into the shadows of the forest and the night.Before him he saw lights in the hands of two villagers who had
evidently been stationed there to keep guard."Yes," he replied, "it is I."He conducted Gabriel Carew to a spot, and pointed downwards with his
finger; and there, prone and still upon the fallen leaves, lay the
body of Eric stone dead, stabbed to the heart!"Martin Hartog," said the priest, "is in custody on suspicion of this
ruthless murder.""What evidence is there to incriminate
him?""When the body was first discovered," said the priest, "your gardener
was standing by its side.Upon being questioned his answer was, 'If
judgment has not fallen upon the monster, it has overtaken his
brother.The brood should be wiped off the face of the earth.'Gabriel Carew was overwhelmed by the horror of this discovery.The
meeting between the brothers, of which he had been a secret witness on
the previous evening, and during which Eric had laid violent hands on
Emilius, recurred to him.He had not spoken of it, nor did he mention
it now.If Martin Hartog confessed his guilt
the matter was settled; if he did not, the criminal must be sought
elsewhere, and it would be his duty to supply evidence which would
tend to fix the crime upon Emilius.He did not believe Martin Hartog
to be guilty; he had already decided within himself that Emilius had
murdered Eric, and that the tragedy of Kristel and Silvain had been
repeated in the lives of Silvain's sons.There was a kind of
retribution in this which struck Gabriel Carew with singular force."Useless," he thought, "to fly from a fate which is preordained.When
he recovered from the horror which had fallen on him upon beholding
the body of Eric, he asked Father Daniel at what hour of the day the
unhappy man had been killed."That," said Father Daniel, "has yet to be determined.No doctor has
seen the body, but the presumption is that when Martin Hartog,
animated by his burning craving for vengeance, of which we were both a
witness, rushed from his cottage, he made his way to the woods, and
that he here unhappily met the brother of the man whom he believed to
be the betrayer of his daughter.The arrival of the magistrate put a stop to the conversation.He
listened to what Father Daniel had to relate, and some portions of the
priest's explanations were corroborated by Gabriel Carew.The
magistrate then gave directions that the body of Eric should be
conveyed to the courthouse; and he and the priest and Carew walked
back to the village together."The village will become notorious," he remarked."Is there an
epidemic of murder amongst us that this one should follow so closely
upon the heels of the other?"Then, after a pause, he asked Father
Daniel whether he believed Martin Hartog to be guilty."I believe no man to be guilty," said the priest, "until he is proved
so incontrovertibly."I bear in remembrance," said the magistrate, "that you would not
subscribe to the general belief in the hunchback's guilt.""Nor do I now," said Father Daniel."And you," said the magistrate, turning to Gabriel Carew, "do you
believe Hartog to be guilty?""This is not the time or place," said Carew, "for me to give
expression to any suspicion I may entertain.The first thing to be
settled is Hartog's complicity in this murder.""Father Daniel believes," continued Carew, "that Eric was murdered
to-day, within the last hour or two."The doctors will decide that," said the magistrate."If the deed was
not, in your opinion, perpetrated within the last few hours, when do
you suppose it was done?""Have you any distinct grounds for the belief?"You have asked me a question which I have answered.There is no
matter of absolute knowledge involved in it; if there were I should be
able to speak more definitely.Until the doctors pronounce there is
nothing more to be said.But I may say this: if Hartog is proved to be
innocent, I may have something to reveal in the interests of justice."The magistrate nodded and said, "By the way, where is Emilius, and
what has he to say about it?""Neither Eric nor Emilius," replied Father Daniel, "slept at home last
night, and since yesterday evening Emilius has not been seen.""Nothing is known of him," said Father Daniel."Inquiries have been
made, but nothing satisfactory has been elicited."The magistrate glanced at Carew, and for a little while was silent.Shortly after they reached the court-house the doctors presented their
report.In their opinion Eric had been dead at least fourteen or
fifteen hours, certainly for longer than twelve.This disposed of the
theory that he had been killed in the afternoon.Their belief was that
the crime was committed shortly after midnight.In that case Martin
Hartog must be incontestably innocent.He was able to account for
every hour of the previous day and night.He was out until near
midnight; he was accompanied home, and a friend sat up with him till
late, both keeping very quiet for fear of disturbing Patricia, who was
supposed to be asleep in her room, but who before that time had most
likely fled from her home.Moreover, it was proved that Martin Hartog
rose in the morning at a certain time, and that it was only then that
he became acquainted with the disappearance of his daughter.Father
Daniel and Gabriel Carew were present when the magistrate questioned
Hartog.The man seemed indifferent as to his fate, but he answered
quite clearly the questions put to him.He had not left his cottage
after going to bed on the previous night; he believed his daughter to
be in her room, and only this morning discovered his mistake.After
his interview with Father Daniel and Gabriel Carew he rushed from the
cottage in the hope of meeting with Emilius, whom he intended to kill;
he came upon the dead body of Eric in the woods, and his only regret
was that it was Eric and not Emilius."If the villain who has dishonoured me were here at this moment," said
Martin Hartog, "I would strangle him.No power should save him from my
just revenge!"The magistrate ordered him to be set at liberty, and he wandered out
of the court-house a hopeless and despairing man.Then the magistrate
turned to Carew, and asked him, now that Hartog was proved to be
innocent, what he had to reveal that might throw light upon the crime.Carew, after some hesitation, related what he had seen the night
before when Emilius and Eric were together in the forest."But," said the magistrate, "the brothers were known to be on the most
loving terms.""So," said Carew, "were their father, Silvain, and his brother Kristel
until a woman stepped between them.Upon this matter, however, it is
not for me to speak."I have heard something of the story of these hapless brothers," said
the magistrate, pondering, "but am not acquainted with all the
particulars.Carew then asked that he should be allowed to go for Doctor Louis, his
object being to explain to the doctor, on their way to the magistrate,
how it was that reference had been made to the story of Silvain and
Kristel which he had heard from the doctor's lips.He also desired to
hint to Doctor Louis that Lauretta might be in possession of
information respecting Eric and Emilius which might be useful in
clearing up the mystery."You have acted right," said Doctor Louis sadly to Gabriel Carew; "at
all risks justice must be done.And
is this to be the end of that fated family?I cannot believe that
Emilius can be guilty of a crime so horrible!"His distress was so keen that Carew himself, now that he was freed
from the jealousy by which he had been tortured with respect to
Lauretta, hoped also that Emilius would be able to clear himself of
the charge hanging over him.But when they arrived at the magistrate's
court they were confronted by additional evidence which seemed to tell
heavily against the absent brother.A witness had come forward who
deposed that, being out on the previous night very late, and taking a
short cut through the woods to his cottage, he heard voices of two men
which he recognised as the voices of Emilius and Eric.They were
raised in anger, and one--the witness could not say which--cried out,

"Well, kill me, for I do not wish to live!"Upon being asked why he did not interpose, his answer was that he did
not care to mix himself up with a desperate quarrel; and that as he
had a family he thought the best thing he could do was to hasten home
as quickly as possible.Having told all he knew he was dismissed, and
bade to hold himself in readiness to repeat his evidence on a future
occasion.Then the magistrate heard what Doctor Louis had to say, and summed up
the whole matter thus:

"The reasonable presumption is, that the brothers quarrelled over some
love affair with a person at present unknown; for although Martin
Hartog's daughter has disappeared, there is nothing as yet to connect
her directly with the affair.Whether premeditatedly, or in a fit of
ungovernable passion, Emilius killed his brother and fled.If he does
not present himself to-morrow morning in the village he must be sought
for.It was a melancholy night for all, to Carew in a lesser degree than to
the others, for the crime which had thrown gloom over the whole
village had brought ease to his heart.He saw now how unreasonable had
been his jealousy of the brothers, and he was disposed to judge them
more leniently.On that night Doctor Louis held a private conference with Lauretta,
and received from her an account of the unhappy difference between the
brothers.As Silvain and Kristel had both loved one woman, so had Eric
and Emilius, but in the case of the sons there had been no supplanting
of the affections.Emilius and Patricia had long loved each other, and
had kept their love a secret, Eric himself not knowing it.When
Emilius discovered that his brother loved Patricia his distress of
mind was very great, and it was increased by the knowledge that was
forced upon him that there was in Eric's passion for the girl
something of the fierce quality which had distinguished Kristel's
passion for Avicia.In his distress he had sought advice from
Lauretta, and she had undertaken to act as an intermediary, and to
endeavour to bring Eric to reason.On two or three occasions she
thought she had succeeded, but her influence over Eric lasted only as
long as he was in her presence.He made promises which he found it
impossible to keep, and he continued to hope against hope.Lauretta
did not know what had passed between the brothers on the previous
evening, in the interview of which I was a witness, but earlier in the
day she had seen Emilius, who had confided a secret to her keeping
which placed Eric's love for Patricia beyond the pale of hope.He was
secretly married to Patricia, and had been so for some time.When
Gabriel Carew heard this he recognised how unjust he had been towards
Emilius and Patricia in the construction he had placed upon their
secret interviews.Lauretta advised Emilius to make known his marriage
to Eric, and offered to reveal the fact to the despairing lover, but
Emilius would not consent to this being immediately done.He
stipulated that a week should pass before the revelation was made;
then, he said, it might be as well that all the world should know
it--a fatal stipulation, against which Lauretta argued in vain.Thus
it was that in the last interview between Eric and Lauretta, Eric was
still in ignorance of the insurmountable bar to his hopes.As it
subsequently transpired, Emilius had made preparations to remove
Patricia from Nerac that very night.Up to that point, and at that
time nothing more was known; but when Emilius was tried for the murder
Lauretta's evidence did not help to clear him, because it established
beyond doubt the fact of the existence of an animosity between the
brothers.On the day following the discovery of the murder, Emilius did not make
his appearance in the village, and officers were sent in search of
him.There was no clue as to the direction which he and Patricia had
taken, and the officers, being slow-witted, were many days before they
succeeded in finding him.Their statement, upon their return to Nerac
with their prisoner, was, that upon informing him of the charge
against him, he became violently agitated and endeavoured to escape.He denied that he made such an attempt, asserting that he was
naturally agitated by the awful news, and that for a few minutes he
scarcely knew what he was doing, but, being innocent, there was no
reason why he should make a fruitless endeavour to avoid an inevitable
inquiry into the circumstances of a most dreadful crime.No brother, he declared, had
ever been more fondly loved than Eric was by him, and he would have
suffered a voluntary death rather than be guilty of an act of violence
towards one for whom he entertained so profound an affection.In the
preliminary investigations he gave the following explanation of all
within his knowledge.What Lauretta had stated was true in every
particular; neither did he deny Carew's evidence nor the evidence of
the villager who had deposed that, late on the night of the murder,
high words had passed between him and Eric."The words," said Emilius, "'Well, kill me, for I do not wish to
live!'were uttered by my poor brother when I told him that Patricia
was my wife.For although I had not intended that this should be known
until a few days after my departure, my poor brother was so worked up
by his love for my wife, that I felt I dared not, in justice to him
and myself, leave him any longer in ignorance.For that reason, and
thus impelled, pitying him most deeply, I revealed to him the truth.Had the witness whose evidence, true as it is, seems to bear fatally
against me, waited and listened, he would have been able to testify in
my favour.My poor brother for a time was overwhelmed by the
revelation.His love for my wife perhaps did not die immediately away;
but, high-minded and honourable as he was, he recognised that to
persevere in it would be a guilty act.The force of his passion became
less; he was no longer violent--he was mournful.He even, in a
despairing way, begged my forgiveness, and I, reproachful that I had
not earlier confided in him, begged _his_ forgiveness for the
unconscious wrong I had done him.Then, after a while, we fell
into our old ways of love; tender words were exchanged; we clasped
each other's hand; we embraced.Truly you who hear me can scarcely
realise what Eric and I had always been to each other.More than
brothers--more like lovers.Heartbroken as he was at the conviction
that the woman he adored was lost to him, I was scarcely less
heartbroken that I had won her.And so, after an hour's loving
converse, I left him; and when we parted, with a promise to meet again
when his wound was healed, we kissed each other as we had done in the
days of our childhood."RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LONDON AND BUNGAY.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Secret Inheritance  (Volume 2 of 3), by
B. L.Orders countermanding the command to attack were quickly sent to the
Southerners at the lower fords, and preparations were hurriedly made to
repulse the attack of the Northern force.Tyler reached the Stone Bridge before six in the morning and opened fire
on a Confederate force under Colonel Evans on the other side of the run.For some time this was kept up, and Evans was much puzzled that the
Federals did not attempt to cross the bridge; they merely kept up a
desultory fire.The failure of the Union troops to advance led Evans to
believe that Tyler's attack was only a feint and that the real attacking
force would approach from some other direction.This belief was confirmed
when he descried a lengthening line of dust above the tree-tops far in the
distance, north of the Warrenton turnpike.Evans was now convinced (and he
was right) that the main Union army was marching to Sudley's Ford, three
miles above the Stone Bridge, and would reach the field from that
direction.Quickly then he turned about with six companies of brave South
Carolinians and a battalion of "Louisiana Tigers" and posted them on a
plateau overlooking the valley of Young's Branch, a small tributary of
Bull Run.Here, not far from the Matthews and Carter houses, he awaited
the coming of the Federals.His force was stationed overlooking the Sudley and Newmarket road and an
open field through which the Federal troops would be forced to pass to
reach the higher ground held by the Confederates.Two 6-pound howitzers
were placed to sweep the field of approach, one at each end of Evans' line
of defense.With guns loaded, and howitzers ready to pour their charges into an
advancing force, the Southerners stood and watched the line of dust that
arose above the trees.Then, where the
Sudley road turns to the southward to cross the Sudley Ford, it followed
the trend of the highway.It reached the crossing of Bull Run, and the
line of dust faded as the Federals spread into battle-line behind the
expanse of woodland that hid each column from the other's view.The rays of the summer sun were beating in
sweltering heat upon the waiting troops.Those who could find shelter
beneath the trees moved from their places into the shade.Heavy banks of
storm clouds were gathering on the horizon, giving promise of relief from
oppressive warmth.A silence settled over the ranks of the Confederates as
they watched the edge of the woodland for the first appearance of the
approaching troops.Suddenly there was a glimmer of the sunlight reflected from burnished
steel among the trees.Then, in open battle array, the Federal advance
guard, under the command of Colonel Burnside, emerged from the wood on a
neighboring hill, and for the first time in the nation's history two
hostile American armies faced each other in battle array.At Fort Sumter
only the stone walls had suffered; not a drop of human blood was shed.But
here was to be a gigantic conflict, and thousands of people believed that
here on this field on this day would be decided the fate of the Union and
the fate of the Confederacy.The whole country awaited in breathless
expectancy the news of this initial conflict, to become known as the
battle of Bull Run.The Federals had a clear advantage in
numbers as their outlying forces came up; but they met with a brave
resistance.General Bee, of South Carolina, with two brigades, crossed a
valley to the south of Evans in the face of a heavy artillery fire to a
point within one hundred yards of the Federal lines.At this short range
thousands of shots were fired and many brave men and boys were stretched
upon the green.The outcome at this point was uncertain until the Union
forces were joined by Heintzelman with heavy reenforcements and by Sherman
with a portion of Tyler's division.Bee could now do nothing but
withdraw, and in doing so his men fell into great disorder.Cheer after
cheer arose from the ranks of the Union army.Meanwhile, Generals Beauregard and Johnston had remained at the right of
their line, near Manassas, nearly four miles from the scene of action,
still determined to press their attack on the Federal left if the
opportunity was offered.As the morning passed and the sounds of conflict
became louder and extended further to the westward, it became evident to
the Confederate leaders that the Federals were massing all their strength
in an effort to crush the left of the Southern army.Plans for an
aggressive movement were then abandoned, the commanders withdrawing all
their reserve forces from the positions where they had been held to follow
up the Confederate attack, and sending them to the support of the small
force that was holding back the Federals.After dispatching troops to
threaten the Union left, Johnston and Beauregard galloped at full speed to
the scene of the battle.They arrived about noon--at the moment when Bee's
brigade was fleeing across the valley from the hail of Federal bullets.As
the frightened men were running in the utmost disorder, General Bee,
seeing Thomas J. Jackson's brigade calmly waiting the onset, exclaimed to
his men, "Look at Jackson; there he stands like a stone wall!"The
expression spread to the army and to the world, and that invincible
soldier has since been known as "Stonewall" Jackson.Beauregard and Johnston found it a herculean task to rally the fleeing men
and re-form the lines, but they succeeded at length; the battle was
renewed, and from noon till nearly three o'clock it raged with greater
fury than before.The fight was chiefly for the possession of the plateau
called the Henry hill.Up and down the <DW72>s the two armies surged in the
broiling sun.Beauregard, like McDowell on the other side, led his men in
the thickest of the fight.A bursting shell killed his horse under him and
tore the heel from his boot; he mounted another horse and continued the
battle.At half-past two the Confederates had been entirely driven from
the plateau, had been pressed back for a mile and a half, and for the
second time within three or four hours the Union troops raised the shout
of victory.At three o'clock, while McDowell and his men were congratulating
themselves on having won the battle, a faint cheering was heard from a
Confederate army far across the hills.It grew louder and nearer, and
presently the gray lines were seen marching gallantly back toward the
scene of the battle from which they had been driven.The thrilling cry
then passed through the Union ranks, "Johnston has come, Johnston has
come!"They did not know that Johnston,
with two-thirds of his army, had arrived the day before; but it was true
that the remaining third, twenty-three hundred fresh troops, had reached
Manassas at noon by rail, and after a forced march of three hours, under
the command of Kirby Smith, had just united with the army of Beauregard.It was this that caused the cheering and determined Beauregard to make
another attack on the Henry plateau.The Union men had fought valiantly in this, their first battle, untrained
and unused to warfare as they were; they had braved the hail of lead and
of bursting shells; they had witnessed their comrades, their friends, and
neighbors fall at their feet to rise no more.But with the long march and the five hours' fighting in
the scorching July sun they were weary to exhaustion, and when they saw
the Confederates again approaching, reenforced with fresh troops, their
courage failed and they began to retreat down the hill.With waving colors
the Confederates pressed on, opening a volley of musketry on the
retreating Federals, and following it with another and another.In vain McDowell and his officers attempted to rally his panic-stricken
men and re-form his lines.Only the regulars, about sixteen hundred in
number, were subject to the orders of their superiors, and they made a
brave stand against the oncoming foe while they covered the retreat of the
disorganized mass.On the Henry hill were the two powerful batteries of
Griffin and Ricketts.They had done most valiant service while the tide of
battle ebbed and flowed.A Confederate
regiment, dashing from a neighboring hill, poured in a deadly volley, cut
down the cannoneers almost to a man, killed their horses, and captured the
guns.A few minutes later General Beauregard rode up to the spot and
noticed Captain Ricketts lying on the ground, desperately wounded.The two
men had been friends in the years gone by.Beauregard, recognizing his old
friend, asked him if he could be of any service.He then sent his own
surgeons to care for the wounded captain and detailed one of his staff to
make him comfortable when he was carried to Richmond as a prisoner of war.There is little more to relate of the battle of Bull Run.In his report
McDowell stated that after providing for the protection of the retreat
from the battlefield by Porter's and Blenker's volunteer brigades, he took
command in person of the force previously stationed for holding the road
back to Centreville and made such disposition "as would best serve to
check the enemy," at the Centreville ridge.Some hundreds of civilians,
members of Congress and others, had come out from Washington to witness a
victory for the Grand Army, and they saw that army scattered in wild
flight to escape an imaginary pursuer.The Confederates made no serious
effort to follow after them, for the routed Federals had destroyed the
Stone Bridge as they passed it in their retreat, and had obstructed the
other avenues of pursuit.As darkness settled over the field the
Confederates returned to their camps.McDowell made a desperate effort to check and reorganize his army at
Centreville, but he was powerless.The troops refused to listen to any
commands; they rushed on and great numbers of them traveled all night,
reaching Washington in the morning.These raw troops had now received their first baptism of blood and fire.Nearly five hundred of their number were left dead on the field of battle,
and fourteen hundred were wounded.The captured and missing brought the
Federal loss to nearly three thousand men.The Confederate loss in killed,
wounded, and missing was less than two thousand.The Federal forces
engaged were nearly nineteen thousand, while the Confederates had more
than eighteen thousand men on the field.The Confederate victory at Bull Run did the South great injury in that it
led vast numbers to believe the war was over and that the South had won.Many soldiers went home in this belief, and for months thereafter it was
not easy to recruit the Southern armies.The North, on the other hand, was
taught a needed lesson--was awakened to a sense of the magnitude of the
task before it.The first great battle of the American Civil War brought joy to the
Confederacy and grief to the States of the North.As the Federal troops
marched into Washington through a drenching downpour of rain, on July 22d,
the North was shrouded in gloom.But the defeated army had not lost its
courage.The remnants of the shattered forces were gathered, and from the
fragments a mightier host was to be rallied under the Stars and Stripes to
meet the now victorious foe on future battle-grounds.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF WASHINGTON--GENERAL IRVIN McDOWELL AND HIS
STAFF.]The man who planned the battle of Bull Run for the Northern Army was
Brigadier-General Irvin McDowell, then in command of the forces before
Washington.When assured that Patterson would hold Johnston in the
Shenandoah, he undertook to advance with his raw and unorganized troops on
Beauregard at Manassas.The plan for the battle which he adopted on the
night of July 18th was, according to General Sherman, one of the best
formed during the entire war.But it failed because, even before he began
his attack, Johnston with a good part of his troops had already joined
Beauregard at Manassas.After the defeat McDowell was placed in charge of
the defenses of Washington on the Virginia side of the Potomac.This
picture was taken the next year at General Robert E. Lee's former home in
Arlington.[Illustration: G. T. Beauregard

THE SOUTHERNER OF THE HOUR IN '61.Born in New Orleans on May 28, 1818, the Southern leader upon whom at
first all eyes were turned, Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, was
graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1838.Gallant and dashing, he
won the brevets of Captain and Major in the war with Mexico and was
wounded at Chapultepec.Early in '61 he resigned from the army, and joined
the Confederacy, being in command of the Confederate forces in the firing
on Fort Sumter in April.Owing to his forceful personality, he became a
popular and noted leader in the Confederacy.Sandra moved to the hallway.After the Union defeat at
Manassas, he was looked upon as the coming Napoleon.He was confirmed as
Major-General in the Confederate army on July 30, 1861, but he had held
the provisional rank of Brigadier-General since February 20th, before a
shot was fired.After his promotion to Major-General, he commanded the
Army of the Mississippi under General A. S. Johnston, whom he succeeded at
Shiloh.He defended Charleston, S. C., in 1862-3 and afterward commanded
the Department of North Carolina and Southeastern Virginia.He died at New
Orleans in 1893.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FIRST UNION VOLUNTEER REGIMENTS.]The First Minnesota, a regiment that fought in the flanking column at Bull

on April 29, the First Minnesota was mustered into service by Lieutenant
W. W. Sanders, U. S. A. Under Colonel William O. Gorman the regiment
proceeded to Washington in June and, attached to Franklin's Brigade,
Heintzelman's Division of McDowell's Army, at Bull Run gave an excellent
account of itself, finally retiring from the field in good order.A record

THE OLD CAPITOL PRISON

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a zealous and trusted friend of the
Confederacy, lived in Washington at the opening of the war.It was she
who, on July 16, 1861, sent the famous cipher message to Beauregard,
"Order issued for McDowell to move on Manassas to-night."Acting on this,
Beauregard promptly arranged his army for the expected attack, while
Johnston and "Stonewall" Jackson hastened from the Valley to aid in
repelling the Federal advance.Greenhow's secret-service work was cut
short on August 26th, when Allan Pinkerton, the Federal detective,
arrested her and put her under military guard at her home, 398 Sixteenth
Street.Afterward she was transferred to the Old Capitol Prison.She
remained there until April, 1862.On June 2nd, after pledging her word not
to come north of the Potomac until the war was over, Mrs.Greenhow was
escorted beyond the lines of the Union army and set at liberty.It was
later discovered that she had, even while in prison, corresponded
extensively with Colonel Thomas Jordan, of General Beauregard's staff.[Illustration: TROOPS THAT FOUGHT AT BULL RUN--A THREE MONTHS' COMPANY.]When Lincoln issued his call for volunteers on the evacuation of Sumter,

the famous first battle of the war, the regiment was in Burnside's Brigade
of Hunter's Division, which marched some miles to the north, crossed Bull
Run at Sudley Ford, met the Confederates north of Young's Branch, and
drove them south across the stream to the Henry house plateau.Later it
yielded to the panic which seized upon the Union army.On August 2, 1861,
Company "D" closed its brief career in the conflict that was to fill four
years with continuous combat.[Illustration: THE FOURTH NEW JERSEY ON THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC, 1861

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE RAW MATERIAL

The faces of these untried soldiers from New Jersey and Vermont show the
enthusiasm with which men flocked from every state to form an army for the
Union.Nor was that enthusiasm chilled by the long tedious unfamiliar
beating into shape that McClellan was giving them in '61.War's tedious
rudiments had to be learned, but when the time came for fighting, fighting
qualities were not lacking and our citizen soldiers gave an account of
themselves that startled the world.The Green Mountain Boys that first
came to Washington were among the troops that made the first warlike move
from the city to extend the Federal lines into Virginia.It was on these
advanced defences of the Capital that a Green Mountain Boy was found one
night asleep on post.His life was forfeit, but the great heart of Father
Abraham interposed.Lincoln knew the stuff of which these country lads
were made, and this one a few months later on the battlefield nobly laid
down the life he owed to his Commander-in-Chief.Vermont was lavish of her
sons and sent 35,262, nearly 60 per cent.of her male population between
the ages of 18 and 45, to the nation's aid.The State of New Jersey sent
76,814 men, 61.2 per cent.The first raw New
Jersey soldiers in Washington were among the troops that occupied
Arlington Heights, one of the advance positions in the defences.About
one-eighth of New Jersey's troops laid down their lives for their country,
while nearly one-fourth of the Vermonters that went to the War never
returned.[Illustration: THE SIXTH VERMONT AT CAMP GRIFFIN, VIRGINIA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: EVE OF THE CONFLICT.]Stone Church, Centreville, Virginia.--Past this little stone church on the
night of July 20, 1861, and long into the morning of the twenty-first
marched lines of hurrying troops.Their blue uniforms were new, their
muskets bright and polished, and though some faces were pale their spirits
were elated, for after their short training they were going to take part,
for the first time, in the great game of war.It was the first move of the
citizen soldier of the North toward actual conflict.Not one knew exactly
what lay before him.The men were mostly from New England and the Middle
States.They had left desk and shop and farm and forge, and with the
thought in their minds that the war would last for three months the
majority had been mustered in.Only the very wise and farseeing had
prophesied the immensity of the struggle, and these were regarded as
extremists.So on they went in long lines
down the road in the darkness of the night, chattering, laughing and
talking carelessly, hardly realizing in the contagion of their patriotic
ardor the grim meaning of real war.The battle had been well planned, but
who had had the experience, even among the leaders, to be sure of the
details and the absolute carrying out of orders?With the exception of the
veterans of the Mexican War, who were regulars, there was not one who had
ever maneuvered a thousand men in the field.A lesson lay before them and
it was soon to come.The surprising battle that opened early in the
morning, and whose results spread such consternation through the North,
was really the result of popular clamor.The press and the politicians
demanded action, and throughout the South the same confident and reckless
spirit prevailed, the same urging to see something done.[Illustration: HERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON WON HIS NAME.]Robinson House, Bull Run.--"Stonewall" Jackson won his name near this
house early in the afternoon of July 21st.Meeting General Bee's troops
retreating in increasing disorder, he advanced with a battery to the ridge
behind the Robinson House and held the position until Bee's troops had
rallied in his rear."Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall,"
was the sentence that gave birth to his historic nickname.It was General
Bee who uttered these words, just before he fell, adding, "Rally on the
Virginians."[Illustration: WHERE THE CONFEDERATES WAVERED.]Center of Battle of Morning--July 21, 1861.--North of this house, about a
mile, the Confederate Colonel Evans met the columns of Burnside and Porter
in their advance south from Sudley Ford.Though reinforced by General Bee,
he was driven back at noon to this house in the valley near Young's
Branch.Here a vigorous Union charge swept the whole battle to the hill
south of the stream.General Bee sent for reinforcements, saying that
unless he could be supported "all was lost."[Illustration: AFTER BULL RUN--GUARDING THE PRISONERS.]Inside Castle Pinckney, Charleston Harbor, August, 1861.--In these
hitherto unpublished Confederate photographs we see one of the earliest
volunteer military organizations of South Carolina and some of the first
Federal prisoners taken in the war.The Charleston Zouave Cadets were
organized in the summer of 1860, and were recruited from among the
patriotic young men of Charleston.We see in the picture how very young
they were.The company first went into active service on Morris Island,
January 1, 1861, and was there on the 9th when the guns of the battery
turned back the _Star of the West_ arriving with reinforcements for
Sumter.The company was also stationed on Sullivan's Island during the
bombardment of Sumter, April 12-13, 1861.After the first fateful clash at
Bull Run, July 21, 1861, had taught the North that the war was on in
earnest, a number of Federal prisoners were brought to Charleston and
placed for safe-keeping in Castle Pinckney, then garrisoned by the
Charleston Zouave Cadets.To break the monotony of guard duty Captain
Chichester, some time in August, engaged a photographer to take some
pictures about the fort showing his men.Gray uniforms with red stripes,
red fatigue caps, and white cross belts were a novelty.The casemates of
the fort had been fitted up with bunks and doors as sleeping quarters for
the prisoners.1 was occupied by prisoners from the 11th New
York Zouaves, who had been recruited almost entirely from the New York
Fire Department.The smaller picture is a nearer view of their quarters,
over which they have placed the sign "Hotel de Zouave."We see them still
wearing the uniform of the battlefield: wide dark-blue trousers with socks
covering the bottoms, red flannel shirts with the silver badge of the New
York Fire Department, blue jackets elaborately trimmed with braid, red fez
caps with blue tassels, and a blue sash around the waist.Their regiment,
the famous "Ellsworth's Zouaves," was posted at Bull Run as a support for
Pickett's and Griffin's Batteries during the fierce fighting of the
afternoon on the Henry House hill.They gave way before the charge of the
Confederates, leaving 48 dead and 75 wounded on the field.About 65 of
them were taken prisoners, some of whom we see here a month after the
battle.At the
beginning of the war the possession of prisoners did not mean as much to
the South as it did later in the struggle, when exchanges became almost
the last resource for recruiting the dwindling ranks.Almost every
Southerner capable of bearing arms had already joined the colors.[Illustration: THE PRISONERS--11th NEW YORK ZOUAVES.][Illustration: THE CIVIL WAR SOLDIER AS HE REALLY LOOKED AND MARCHED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]There is nothing to suggest military brilliancy about this squad.Attitudes are as prosaic as uniforms are unpicturesque.The only man
standing with military correctness is the officer at the left-hand end.But this was the material out of which was developed the soldier who could
average sixteen miles a day for weeks on end, and do, on occasion, his
thirty miles through Virginia mud and his forty miles over a hard
Pennsylvania highway.Sixteen miles a day does not seem far to a single
pedestrian, but marching with a regiment bears but little relation to a
solitary stroll along a sunny road.It is a far different matter to trudge
along carrying a heavy burden, choked by the dust kicked up by hundreds of
men tramping along in front, and sweltering in the sun--or trudge still
more drearily along in a pelting rain which added pounds to a soaked and
clinging uniform, and caused the soldiers to slip and stagger in the mud.[Illustration: "RIGHT SHOULDER SHIFT"--COLUMN OF FOURS--THE TWENTY-SECOND

Along this sloping hillside, well suited for a camp, we see a Federal
regiment at its full strength, before bullets and sickness had lowered its
numbers to a mere skeleton of its former self.The band is out in front,
the men are standing at "shoulder arms;" the Colonel and his Major and
Adjutant, mounted on their sleek, well-fed horses, are grouped at one
side, conscious that the eye of the camera is upon them.There is an old
adage among military men that "a straight shot takes the best."When a
freshly joined regiment, recruited to its full strength, reached the army
corps to which it had been assigned and which had been for a long time
actively engaged, it caused comment that well may be understood."Hello,
here comes a new brigade!"cried a veteran of the Potomac who had seen
eight months' continuous service, calling the attention of a companion to
a new regiment just marching into camp.exclaimed the other,
"I'll bet my hat it's a division!"There are instances in plenty where a
company commander found himself at the head of less than a score of men;
where regiments that had started a 1,000 strong could muster but some 200
odd, and where, in a single action, the loss in killed, wounded and
missing was over sixty per cent.We begin to understand
what war is when we stop to think of this.[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF SHILOH._Painted by Paul Wilhelmi._

FORT HENRY AND FORT DONELSON

    By this brilliant and important victory Grant's fame sprang suddenly
    into full and universal recognition.President Lincoln nominated him
    major-general of volunteers, and the Senate at once confirmed the
    appointment.The whole military service felt the inspiriting
    event.--_Nicolay and Hay, in "Life of Lincoln."_


The grasp of a great section of western Kentucky and Tennessee by the
Northern armies, the capture of a stronghold that was thought impregnable,
the forced surrender of a great army, and the bringing into public notice
of a new commander who was destined to outshine all his fellows--these
were the achievements of the short, vigorous campaign of Fort Donelson.There were two great battle-grounds of the Civil War, nearly a thousand
miles apart--Virginia and the valley of the great river that divides the
continent--and the two definite objects of the Northern armies during the
first half of the war period were to capture Richmond and to open the
Mississippi.All other movements and engagements were subordinate to the
dramas of these two great theaters, incidental and contributory.The
South, on the other hand, except for the early threatening of Washington,
the Gettysburg campaign, the raid of Morgan in Ohio, and the expeditions
of Bragg and Hood into Kentucky and Tennessee, was on the defensive from
the beginning of the war to the end.In the East after the initial engagement at Bull Run "all was quiet along
the Potomac" for some months.McClellan had loomed large as the rising
hero of the war; but McClellan did not move with the celerity that was
expected of him; the North became impatient and demanded that something
be done.But while the public was still waiting there were two occurrences
in the West that riveted the attention of the nation, sending a thrill of
gladness through the North and a wave of depression over the Southland.These were the fall of Fort Henry and of Fort Donelson.After Missouri had been saved to the Union in spite of the disaster at
Wilson's Creek in August, 1861, a Union army slowly gathered in southern
Illinois.Its purpose was to dispute with the Confederates their hold on
Kentucky, which had not seceded, and to regain control of the Mississippi.To secure the latter end a flank movement was decided upon--to open the
mighty river by moving up the Cumberland and Tennessee--the greatest
flanking movement in the history of warfare.It began at Fort Henry and
ended at Vicksburg, covered a year and five months, and cost tens of
thousands of human lives and millions of dollars' worth of property--but
it was successful.Eastern Kentucky, in the early days of 1862, was also in considerable
ferment.Colonel James A. Garfield had driven the Confederate commander,
General Humphrey Marshall, and a superior force into the Cumberland
Mountains, after a series of slight encounters, terminating at Paintsville
on the Big Sandy River, on January 10th.But one later event gave great
encouragement to the North.It was the first substantial victory for the
Union arms.General Zollicoffer held the extreme Confederate right at
Cumberland Gap and he now joined General George B. Crittenden near Mill
Springs in central Kentucky.General Buell, in charge of the Army of the
Ohio, had placed General George H. Thomas at Lebanon, and the latter
promptly moved against this threatening Confederate force.A sharp
engagement took place at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs on January
19th.The Confederate army was utterly routed and Zollicoffer was killed.The Union loss was about two hundred and sixty, and the Confederate over
twice that number.It was not a great battle, but its effect on the North
was most stimulating, and the people first learned to appreciate the
abilities of their great general, George H. Thomas.General U. S. Grant was in command of the Union
forces in western Kentucky and Tennessee.The opposing commander was
Albert Sidney Johnston, then reputed the ablest general of the South.At
Bowling Green, Kentucky, he had thirty thousand men.Believing, perhaps,
that he could not hold Kentucky, he determined to save Tennessee for the
South and took his stand at Nashville.On February 2d, 1862, General Grant left Cairo with his army of seventeen
thousand men and on transports moved up the Ohio and the Tennessee to
attack Fort Henry.Accompanying him was Flag-Officer Foote with his fleet
of seven gunboats, four of them ironclads.Fort Henry was garrisoned by an army of about three thousand men under the
command of General Lloyd Tilghman, a brave officer who was destined to
give his life for the Confederate cause, the following year, near
Vicksburg.It covered about three acres and mounted seventeen heavy guns.Grant's plan of attack was to land his army four miles below the fort, to
move across the country and seize the road leading to Fort Donelson, while
Foote should move up the river with his fleet and turn his guns on the
Confederate batteries.On February 6th, Foote formed his vessels into two lines, the
ironclads--the _Cincinnati_, the _Carondelet_, the _Essex_, and the _St.Slowly and cautiously he approached the
fort, firing as he went, the guns on the parapet answering those of the
fleet.The fleet was yet
unhurt when the first hour had passed.Then a 24-pound shot struck the
_Essex_, crashed through her side and penetrated her boiler, instantly
killing both her pilots and flooding the vessel from stem to stern with
scalding steam.The _Essex_, wholly disabled, drifted down stream, while
her companion ships continued their advance and increased their fire.Presently, a sound exceeding the roar of cannon was heard above the
tumult.A great gun in the fort had exploded, killing or disabling every
man who served it.A great 10-inch columbiad was also destroyed.Tilghman,
seeing that he had no hope of holding the fort, decided to save his army
by sending it to Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River.This he did,
reserving fewer than a hundred men to work the guns.He then raised the
white flag and surrendered the seventy-eight that remained.Grant had
failed to reach the road to Fort Donelson until the Confederates had
escaped.The Southerners hastened across the country and added their
numbers to the defenders of Donelson--and by so doing they deferred
surrender for ten days.Fort Donelson was a fortified enclosure of a hundred acres that crowned a
plateau on the Cumberland River.It was just south of the boundary between
Kentucky and Tennessee and close by the little village of Dover,
consisting of a court-house, a two-story tavern, and a few houses
scattered about.Beneath the bluff and on the river bank were two powerful
batteries commanding the approach to the river.Outside the fort and
stretching far along the ridges that enclosed it were rifle-pits, lines of
logs covered with yellow clay.Farther beyond, the hillsides were covered
with felled trees whose interlacing branches were supposed to render the
approach of the foe impossible under fire.At this moment Donelson was held by eighteen thousand men under the
command of General John B. Floyd, late Secretary of War in the cabinet of
Buchanan.Next to him were Gideon J. Pillow and Simon B. Buckner.The
Union army under Grant was divided into three parts under the respective
commands of Charles F. Smith, a veteran of the regular army; John A.
McClernand, an Illinois lawyer and member of Congress, and Lew Wallace,
the future author of "Ben Hur."With waving banners the divisions of Smith and McClernand marched across
country on February 12th, arriving at noon and encircling the doomed fort
ere nightfall.Smith was stationed on the left and McClernand on the
extreme right, near the village of Dover.This left an open space in the
center, to be filled by Lew Wallace, who arrived with his division the
next day.On the 13th there was a continuous bombardment from morning till
night, punctuated by the sharp crack of the sharpshooter's rifle.The chief action of the day that involved the infantry was an attempt to
capture a battery on a hill, near the center of the Confederate line of
battle, known as Maney's Battery, commanded by Captain Maney, of
Tennessee.This battery had annoyed McClernand greatly, and he delegated
his third brigade to capture it.The charge was led by Colonel Morrison of
Illinois, and a braver one never was made throughout the whole period of
the war.The men who made it were chiefly youths from the farms and
workshops of Illinois.With no apparent thought of danger they sallied
forth, determined at all hazards to capture the battery on the hill, which
stood out in relief against the sky.As they ran up the hill, firing as
they went, their numbers were rapidly thinned by the terrific cross-fire
from this battery and two others on adjoining hills.Still the survivors
pushed on and their deadly fire thinned the ranks of the men at the
battery.At length when they came within forty yards of the goal a long
line of Confederate musketry beside the battery suddenly burst into flame
and a storm of bullets cut down the brave boys of Illinois, with fearful
slaughter.Even then they stood for fifteen minutes, returning volley for
volley, before retreating.Reaching the foot of the hill, they rallied
under the Stars and Stripes, and returned to the assault.Even a third
time they charged, but the dry leaves on the ground now caught fire, the
smoke stifled them, and they had to retreat.As they returned down the
hill, Lew Wallace tells us, "their ears and souls were riven with the
shrieks of their wounded comrades, upon whom the flames crept and
smothered and charred where they lay."That night the river gunboats, six in
number, four of them ironclads, under the command of Andrew H. Foote,
arrived.Grant had sent them down the Tennessee to the Ohio and up the
Cumberland, to support his army at Fort Donelson.On the 14th, about three
in the afternoon, Foote steamed with his four ironclads to a point in the
river within four hundred yards of the two powerful batteries on the river
bank under the fort and opened fire with his cannon while continuing to
advance.The reply from the Confederate batteries was terrific and many of
their shots struck home.In a short time the decks of the vessels were
slippery with human blood.At length a
solid shot struck the pilot house of the flagship and tore away the pilot
wheel.At almost the same moment another gunboat was disabled.The two
vessels, one of which had been struck fifty-nine times, could no longer be
managed; they turned about with the eddies of the river and floated down
with the current.The Confederates raised a wild shout of joy at this, their second victory
since the coming of the Union army.But what will be the story of the
morrow?With the reenforcements brought by Foote, Lew Wallace's division,
Grant's army was now swelled to twenty-seven thousand, and in spite of the
initial repulse the Federals felt confident of ultimate victory.But a
dreary night was before them.All that
fearful night of February 14th there was a fierce, pitiless wind with
driving sleet and snow.Thousands of the men, weary of the burden of their
overcoats and blankets during the warm preceding days, had thrown them
away.Now they spent the night lying behind logs or in ditches or wherever
they could find a little protection from the wintry blasts.General Floyd,
knowing that Grant's army was much stronger than his own, decided, after
consulting with Pillow and Buckner, to attack the Union right at dawn on
the 15th.The night was spent in preparing for this, and in the morning Pillow with
ten thousand men fell upon McClernand, and Buckner soon joined him with an
additional force.Toward noon many of McClernand's men ran short of powder
and he was forced to recede from his position.Pillow seems then to have
lost his head.He felt that the whole Union army was defeated, and though
the road to Nashville was open, the Confederates made no attempt to
escape.He had been absent
all morning down the river consulting Foote, not knowing that the
Confederates had planned an escape.This moment, says Lew Wallace, was the
crisis in the life of Grant.Hearing the disastrous news, his face flushed for a moment; he crushed
some papers in his hand.Next instant he was calm, and said in his
ordinary tone, to McClernand and Wallace, "Gentlemen, the position on the
right must be retaken."In a short
time the Union lines were in motion.John went to the bathroom.General Smith made a grand assault on
the Confederate outworks and rifle-pits.When his lines hesitated Smith
waved his cap on the point of his sword and rode in front, up the hill, in
the hottest fire of the foe, toward the rifle-pits--and they were carried.At the same moment Lew Wallace was leading his division up another <DW72>
with equal gallantry.Here again the Confederates retired, and the road to
Nashville was no longer open.Furthermore, Smith held a position from
which he could shell the fort on the inside, and nothing was left to the
inmates but surrender or slaughter on the morrow.A council was held by Floyd, Pillow, and Buckner.Buckner, who was a
master in the art of warfare, declared that he could not hold his position
for half an hour in the morning.Floyd was
under indictment at Washington for maladministration in the Buchanan
cabinet.He declared that he must not be taken, and that with his
Virginia troops he would escape on two little boats that were to arrive
from Nashville in the morning.He passed the command to Pillow, and
Pillow, declaring that he too would escape, passed it on to Buckner.Floyd
and Pillow with their men made good their escape; so did Colonel Forrest,
the cavalry leader, and his mounted force.In the early morning Buckner sent a note to Grant offering to capitulate.Grant demanded "unconditional surrender," and
added, "I propose to move immediately on your works."Buckner was too good
a soldier to sacrifice his men in needless slaughter.His men were so worn
with eighty-four hours of fighting and watching that many of them had
fallen asleep while standing in battle-line and under fire.He accepted
the "ungenerous and unchivalrous terms," as he pronounced them, and
surrendered Fort Donelson and the army, consisting of at least fourteen
thousand men, with all its stores of ammunition.The Union loss was over
twenty-eight hundred men.The Confederate loss, killed and wounded, was
about two thousand.The capture of Fort Donelson did three things.First, it opened up the way
for the Federal army to penetrate the heart of the western South and gave
it control of Kentucky and of western Tennessee.Second, it electrified
the North with confident hopes of ultimate success.It was the first great
victory for the North in the war.Bull Run had been a moral victory to the
South, but the vanquished were weakened scarcely more than the victors.At
Donelson, the victors gained control of an extensive territory and
captured a noble army which could ill be spared by the South and which
could not be replaced.Third, the capture of Donelson forced before the
nation a new man--Ulysses S. Grant.[Illustration: CAPTAIN CLARK B.WINNING HIS SPURS AT CAIRO.Few will recognize in this early and unusual photograph the man who at
Appomattox, wore plain fatigue dress in striking contrast with the fully
uniformed Lee.Here Grant appears in his full-dress Brigadier-General's
uniform as he came to Cairo to assume command of a military district
including southern Illinois, September 4, 1861.Grasping at once the
problems of his new post he began the work of reorganization, assisted by
a well-chosen staff.Without waiting for permission from Fremont, his
immediate superior, Commander of the Department of the West, Grant pushed
forward a force and occupied Paducah, Kentucky, before the Confederates,
approaching with the same purpose, could arrive.Grant was impatient to
drive back the Confederate lines in Kentucky and Tennessee and began early
to importune Washington to be allowed to carry out maneuvers.His keen
judgment convinced him that these must quickly be made in order to secure
the advantage in this outlying arena of the war.Captain Rawlins was made
Assistant Adjutant-General by Grant, and lifted from his shoulders much of
the routine of the post.Captain Lagow and Captain Hillyer were two of the
General's aides-de-camp.James Simons was Medical Director of the
District.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL U. S.[Illustration: CAPTAIN WILLIAM S.[Illustration: CAIRO CITIZENS WHO MAY HAVE RECALLED THIS DAY.]With his hands thrust in his pockets stands General Grant, next to General

chanced to be in the group must have recalled that day with pride.Young

Henry.Fighting blood surged in the veins of Commander W. D. Porter, son
of Admiral David Porter and brother of Admiral David D. Porter.The
gunboat which he led into action at Fort Henry was named after the famous
_Essex_ which his father commanded in the War of 1812.Fifteen of the
shots from Fort Henry struck and told upon the _Essex_, the last one
penetrating her armor and piercing her middle boiler.Commander Porter,
standing among his men directing the fight, was terribly scalded by the
escaping steam, as were twenty-seven others.Wrongly suspected of
disloyalty at the outbreak of the war, Commander Porter's conduct during
the struggle gave the lie to such calumny.He recovered after Fort Henry,
and was made Commodore in July, 1862.Again in command of the _Essex_ he
attempted unsuccessfully to destroy the dread Confederate ram _Arkansas_
at Vicksburg on July 22d.Porter and the _Essex_ then joined Farragut's
fleet.His shells helped the Union forces to repulse the Confederates at
Baton Rouge, August 5th, and he witnessed the blowing up of the _Arkansas_
the following day.[Illustration: COMMANDER W. D.[Illustration: THE _ESSEX_ TWO YEARS LATER.][Illustration: THE GUNBOAT THAT FIRED THE FIRST SHOT AT FORT HENRY.]Here, riding at anchor, lies the flagship of Foote, which opened the
attack on Fort Henry in the first movement to break the backbone of the
Confederacy, and won a victory before the arrival of the army.This
gunboat, the _Cincinnati_, was one of the seven flat-bottom ironclads
built by Captain Eads at Carondelet, Missouri, and Mound City, Illinois,
during the latter half of 1861.When Grant finally obtained permission
from General Halleck to advance the attack upon Fort Henry on the
Tennessee River, near the border of Kentucky, Flag Officer Foote started
up the river, February 2, 1862, convoying the transports, loaded with the
advance detachment of Grant's seventeen thousand troops.Arriving before
Fort Henry on February 6th, the intrepid naval commander at once began the
bombardment with a well-aimed shot from the _Cincinnati_.The eleven heavy
guns of the fort responded in chorus, and an iron rain began to fall with
telling effect upon the _Cincinnati_, the _Essex_, the _Carondelet_, and
the _St.Louis_, which were steaming forward half a mile in advance of the
rear division of the squadron.At a range of 1,700 yards the _Cincinnati_
opened the engagement.After a little over an hour of heavy firing the
colors on Fort Henry were lowered and General Tilghman surrendered it to
Flag-Officer Foote.When General Grant arrived an hour later, Foote turned
over the fort to him and returned to Cairo with his disabled gunboats.[Illustration: FLAG-OFFICER FOOTE.]A GALLANT GUNBOAT--THE ST.With the shots from the Confederate batteries ringing and bounding off her
iron plates, this gallant gunboat that Foote had chosen for his flagship,
entered the zone of fire at Fort Donelson.In the confined space of her
smoke-filled gun-deck, the river sailors were loading and firing the heavy
broadsides as fast as the great guns could be run out and aimed at the
frowning line of entrenchments on the river bank.From them the
concentrated hail of iron was poured upon her and the marksmanship was
good.Fifty-nine times was this brave vessel struck.But her armored sides
withstood the heavy shocks although the plating, dented and bent, bore
record of each impact.Nearer and nearer grew the forts as up the narrow
channel the flag-ship led the way, the _Louisville_, the _Carondelet_, and
the _Pittsburgh_ belching their fire at the wooded heights, as though
endeavoring to attract the attention of the Confederate gunners to
themselves and save the flag-ship from receiving more than her share.Up
in the pilot-house the brave man who knew the channel stood at the wheel,
his eyes firmly fixed ahead; and on the "texas," as the upper deck was
called, within speaking distance of him, stood Foote himself.A great
shot, aimed accurately as a minie ball, struck the frail pilot-house.It
was as if the vessel's heart was pierced.The wheel was swept away from
the pilot's hand and the brave river guide was hurled into the corner,
mangled, bleeding and soon to die.He
fell badly wounded in the leg by a fragment of the shell--a wound from
which he never fully recovered.Helpless now, the current swept the _St.Louis'_ bow around, and past her consorts that were still fighting, she
drifted down the stream and out of action; later, in convoy of the
_Louisville_, she returned to Cairo, leaving the _Carondelet_ and
_Pittsburgh_ to escort the transports.Meanwhile on shore, Grant was
earning his first laurels as a soldier in a big battle.The disabling of
the gunboats caused the Confederates to make the fatal attack that
resulted so disastrously for them.Assailing Grant's right wing that held
a strong position, on the 15th of February, 19,000 men were hurled against
a force 8,000 greater in number.Shattered
they retreated to their works, and in the morning of the 16th, the
Confederate general, Buckner, surrendered.About 14,000 prisoners were
taken.The Federal loss was nearly 3,000, and that of the Southern cause
about 1,000 less.For the capture of Fort Donelson Grant was made
major-general.The first step to the conquest of the Mississippi had been
achieved.In October, 1862, the river fleet was transferred from the Army
to the Navy Department, and as there was another vessel in the service,
bearing the same name the _St.Louis_ was renamed the _Baron de Kalb_.At
Fort Henry, she went into action lashed to the _Carondelet_ on account of
the narrowness of the stream; and later again, the gallant gunboat won
laurels at Island No.10, Fort Pillow, Memphis, and Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE FLAG-SHIP _ST.LOUIS_ VIEWED FROM ASTERN.][Illustration: _LOUISVILLE_--A FIGHTER AT THE FORT.][Illustration: THE ADVENTUROUS GUNBOAT _CONESTOGA_.]Lying at anchor in the Ohio River this little wooden gunboat is having the
finishing touches put to her equipment while her officers and men are
impatiently waiting for the opportunity to bring her into action.A
side-wheel river steamer originally, she was purchased at Cincinnati by
Commander John Rodgers in the spring of 1861 and speedily converted into a
gunboat.Her boilers and steam pipes were lowered into the hold and the
oaken bulwarks five inches thick which we see were put on her and pierced
for guns.She got her first taste of fighting when, at Lucas Bend, she
engaged the land batteries and a Confederate gunboat, September 10, 1861.She was present at Fort Henry in the second division of the attacking
fleet, and also at Fort Donelson.[Illustration: THE _TYLER_

A sister-ship of the _Conestoga_.She was present both at Fort Henry and
Fort Donelson.]TWO UNWILLING GUESTS OF THE NORTH.[Illustration: GENERAL FLOYD TILGHMAN.]The Captured Commanders of Forts Henry and Donelson.--It requires as much
moral courage to decide upon a surrender, even when odds are overwhelming,
as it does physical bravery, in maintaining a useless fight to the death.Brigadier-General Tilghman, who commanded the Confederate Fort Henry on
the Tennessee and General Simon Bolivar Buckner in command of the
Confederate Fort Donelson--a much stronger position on the Cumberland only
a few miles away--were men who possessed this kind of courage.Both had
the misfortune to hold untenable positions.Each displayed generalship and
sagacity and only gave up to the inevitable when holding out meant nothing
but wasted slaughter and the sacrifice of men who had been called upon to
exert every human effort.Fort Henry, on the banks of the Tennessee, was
held by a few thousand men and strongly armed with twenty guns including
one 10-inch Columbiad.But on the 6th of February it fairly lay in the
possession of the Federals before a shot had actually been fired, for
Grant with 17,000 men had gained the rear of the fortification after his
move from Cairo on the 30th of the previous month.The actual reduction of
the fort was left to the gunboat flotilla under Flag Officer Foote, whose
heavy bombardment began early in the morning.General Tilghman had seen
from the first that the position could not be held.He was trapped on all
sides, but he would not give way without a display of resistance.Before
the firing began, he had sent off most of the garrison and maintained the
unequal combat with the gunboats for an hour and a quarter with less than
a hundred men, of whom he lost twenty-one.Well did this handful serve the
guns on the river bank.One shot struck the gunboat _Essex_, piercing her
boilers, and wounding and scalding twenty-eight men.But at last,
enveloped on all sides, his retreat cut off--the troops who had been
ordered to depart in the morning, some three thousand in number, had
reached Fort Donelson, twelve miles away--General Tilghman hauled down his
flag, surrendering himself and eighty-four men as prisoners of war.Here
we see him--a brave figure of a man--clad in the uniform of a Southern
Colonel.There was never the slightest doubt of his courage or of his
proper discretion in making this surrender.Only for a short time was he
held a prisoner, when he was exchanged and welcomed back with all honor
into the ranks of the Confederacy, and given an important command.He did
not, however, live long to serve his cause, for shortly after rejoining
the army he was killed at the battle of Baker's Creek, Mississippi, on the
16th of May, 1863.It is not often that on the battlefield ties of friendship are cemented
that last a lifetime, and especially is this so between conqueror and
conquered.Fort Donelson, that was, in a measure, a repetition of Fort
Henry, saw two fighting foes become thus united.It was impossible for the
garrison of Fort Donelson to make its escape after the flotilla of
gunboats had once appeared in the river, although General Floyd, its
senior commander, the former Secretary of War under President Buchanan,
had withdrawn himself from the scene tendering the command to General
Pillow, who in his turn, after escaping with his own brigade, left the
desperate situation to be coped with by General Buckner.Assailed in the
rear by an army that outnumbered the defenders of the fort by nearly eight
thousand and with the formidable gunboats hammering his entrenchments from
the river, Buckner decided to cut his way out in a desperate charge, but
being repulsed, saw his men flung back once more into the fort.There was
nothing for it but to make terms.On February 16th, in a note to Grant he
asked what might be granted him.Here, the coming leader won his nickname
of "Unconditional Surrender" Grant.Buckner was informed that the Federal
army was about to move upon his works.Hurt and smarting under his
position, he sent back a reply that in a few short hours he would,
perhaps, have been willing to recall.Yielding to circumstances he
accepted what he bluntly pronounced, "ungenerous and unchivalrous terms."But when the capitulation had taken place and nearly fifteen thousand men
had surrendered, a greater number than ever before laid down their arms
upon the continent, Grant was so generous, that then and there began the
friendship that grew as close as if the two men were brothers of the
blood.Each one was allowed to retain
his personal baggage, and the officers to keep their side arms.Grant had
known Buckner in the Mexican War, and received him after the battle as his
guest.For a short time General Buckner was kept a prisoner at Fort Warren
until he was exchanged.But the friendship between the two leaders
continued.When General Grant, after having been twice President, failed
in his business career, Buckner sent him a check, trusting that it might
be of use in his time of trouble.Grant, shortly before his death, wrote
his old-time comrade and antagonist requesting that Buckner do him the
final honors by becoming one of his pallbearers.[Illustration: BUCKNER, THE DEFENDER OF DONELSON.]SHILOH--THE FIRST GRAND BATTLE

    No Confederate who fought at Shiloh has ever said that he found any
    point on that bloody field easy to assail.--_Colonel William Preston
    Johnston (Son of the Confederate General, Albert Sidney Johnston,
    killed at Shiloh)._


In the history of America many battles had been fought, but the greatest
of them were skirmishes compared with the gigantic conflicts of the Old
World under Marlborough and Napoleon.On the field of Shiloh, for the
first time, two great American armies were to engage in a mighty struggle
that would measure up to the most important in the annals of Europe.And
the pity of it was that the contestants were brethren of the same
household, not hereditary and unrelenting enemies.At Fort Donelson the western South was not slain--it was only wounded.The
chief commander of that part of the country, Albert Sidney Johnston,
determined to concentrate the scattered forces and to make a desperate
effort to retrieve the disaster of Donelson.He had abandoned Bowling
Green, had given up Nashville, and now decided to collect his troops at
Corinth, Mississippi.Next in command to Johnston was General Beauregard
who fought at Bull Run, and who had come from Virginia to aid Johnston.There also came Braxton Bragg, whose name had become famous through the
laconic expression, "A little more grape, Captain Bragg," uttered by
Zachary Taylor at Buena Vista; Leonidas Polk who, though a graduate of
West Point, had entered the church and for twenty years before the war had
been Episcopal bishop of Louisiana, and John C. Breckinridge, former Vice
President of the United States.The legions of the South were gathered at
Corinth until, by the 1st of April, 1862, they numbered forty thousand.Meantime, the Union army had moved southward and was concentrating at
Pittsburg Landing, on the Tennessee River, an obscure stopping place for
boats in southern Tennessee, and some twenty miles northeast from Corinth.The name means more now than merely a landing place for river craft.It
was clear that two mighty, hostile forces were drawing together and that
ere long there would be a battle of tremendous proportions, such as this
Western hemisphere had not then known.General Grant had no idea that the Confederates would meet him at
Pittsburg Landing.He believed that they would wait for an attack on their
entrenchments at Corinth.The position his army occupied at the Landing
was a kind of quadrilateral, enclosed on three sides by the river and
several small streams that flow into it.As the early days of April passed
there were ominous rumors of the coming storm; but Grant was so sure that
Johnston would not attack that he spent the night of the 5th of April at
Savannah, some miles down the Tennessee River.For two weeks the Union troops had occupied the
undulating tableland that stretched away from the river at the Landing.There was the sound of the plashing streams overflowing from recent rains,
there were revelry and mirth around the thousand camp-fires; but there was
no sound to give warning of the coming of forty thousand men, who had for
two days been drawing nearer with a steady tread, and during this night
were deploying around the Union camp, only a mile away.There was nothing
to indicate that the inevitable clash of arms was but a few hours in the
future.At the dawn of day on Sunday, April 6th, magnificent battle-lines, under
the Confederate battle-flag, emerged from the woods on the neighboring
hills within gunshot of the Federal camps.Whether the Union army was
really surprised has been the subject of long controversy, which we need
not enter.Certainly, the attack on it was most sudden, and in
consequence it fought on the defensive and at a disadvantage throughout
the day.General Hardee's corps, forming the first line of battle, moved against
the outlying division of the Union army, which was commanded by General
Benjamin Prentiss, of West Virginia.Before Prentiss could form his lines
Hardee's shells began bursting around him, but he was soon ready and,
though pressed back for half a mile in the next two or three hours, his
men fought like heroes.Meanwhile the further Confederate advance under
Bragg, Polk, and Breckinridge was extending all along the line in front of
the Federal camps.The second Federal force to encounter the fury of the
oncoming foe was the division of General W. T. Sherman, which was cut to
pieces and disorganized, but only after it had inflicted frightful loss on
the Confederate army.General Grant, as we have noted, spent the night at Savannah, a town nine
miles by way of the river from Pittsburg Landing.As he sat at breakfast,
he heard the distant boom of cannon and he quickly realized that
Johnston's army had attacked his own at the Landing.Instantly he took a
boat and started for the scene of the conflict.At Crump's Landing, about
half way between the two, General Lew Wallace was stationed with a
division of seven thousand men.As Grant passed Crump's Landing, he met
Wallace and ordered him to be ready for instant marching when he was
called for.When Grant arrived at Pittsburg Landing, about eight o'clock
in the morning, he found a tremendous battle raging, and he spent the day
riding from one division commander to another, giving directions and
cheering them on as best he could.About two and a half miles from the Landing stood a little log church
among the trees, in which for years the simple folk of the countryside had
been wont to gather for worship every Sunday morning.But on this fateful
Sunday, the demon of war reigned supreme.Sandra moved to the kitchen.The little church was known as
Shiloh to all the country around, and it gave its name to the great battle
that raged near it on that memorable day.General Prentiss had borne the first onset of the morning.He had been
pressed back half a mile.But about nine o'clock, after being reenforced,
he made a stand on a wooded spot with a dense undergrowth, and here he
held his ground for eight long hours, until five in the afternoon, when he
and a large portion of his division were surrounded and compelled to
surrender.Time after time the Confederates rushed upon his position, but
only to be repulsed with fearful slaughter.This spot came to be known as
the "Hornet's Nest."It was not far from here that the Confederates
suffered the irreparable loss of the day.Their noble commander, Albert
Sidney Johnston, received his death wound as he was urging his troops to
force back Hurlbut's men.He was riding in the center of the fight,
cheering his men, when a minie ball cut an artery of his thigh.But he
thought only of victory and continued in the saddle, raising his voice in
encouragement above the din of battle.Presently his voice became faint, a
deadly pallor blanched his cheek.He was lifted from his horse, but it was
too late.In a few minutes the great commander was dead, from loss of
blood.The death of Johnston, in the belief of many, changed the result at Shiloh
and prevented the utter rout or capture of Grant's army.One of Johnston's
subordinates wrote: "Johnston's death was a tremendous catastrophe.Sometimes the hopes of millions of people depend upon one head and one
arm.The West perished with Albert Sidney Johnston and the Southern
country followed."Jefferson Davis afterward declared that "the fortunes
of a country hung by a single thread on the life that was yielded on the
field of Shiloh."Beauregard succeeded to the command on the fall of Johnston and the
carnage continued all the day--till darkness was falling over the valleys
and the hills.The final charge of the evening was made by three
Confederate brigades close to the Landing, in the hope of gaining that
important point.But by means of a battery of many guns on the bluff of
Dill's Branch, aided by the gunboats in the river, the charge was
repulsed.Beauregard then gave orders to desist from further attack all
along his lines, to suspend operations till morning.When General Bragg
heard this he was furious with rage.He had counted on making an immediate
grand assault in the darkness, believing that he could capture a large
part of the Federal army.When the messenger informed him of Beauregard's order, he inquired if he
had already delivered it to the other commanders."If you had not," rejoined the angry Bragg, "I would not obey it.But Bragg's fears were not shared by his compatriots.Further mention is due the two little wooden gunboats, _Tyler_ and
_Lexington_, for their share in the great fight.The _Tyler_ had lain all
day opposite the mouth of Dill's Branch which flowed through a deep,
marshy ravine, into the Tennessee just above the Landing.Her commander,
Lieutenant Gwin, was eager for a part in the battle, and when he saw the
Confederate right pushing its way toward the Landing, he received
permission to open fire.For an hour his guns increased the difficulties
of Jackson's and Chalmers' brigades as they made their way to the
surrounding of Prentiss.Later on the _Lexington_ joined her sister, and
the two vessels gave valuable support to the Union cannon at the edge of
the ravine and to Hurlbut's troops until the contest ended.All that
night, in the downpour of rain, Lieutenant Gwin, at the request of General
Nelson, sent shot crashing through the trees in the direction where the
Confederates had bivouacked.This completely broke the rest of the
exhausted troops, and had a decided effect upon the next day's result.Southern hopes were high at the close of this first bloody day at Shiloh.Whatever of victory there was at the end of the day belonged to the
Confederates.They had pressed the Federals back more than a mile and now
occupied their ground and tents of the night before.They had captured
General Prentiss with some thousands of his men as a result of his brave
stand at the "Hornet's Nest."But their hopes were mingled with grave fears.General Van Dorn with an
army of twenty thousand men was hastening from Arkansas to join the
Confederate forces at Shiloh; but the roads were bad and he was yet far
away.On the other hand, Buell was coming from Nashville to join Grant's
army.Should he arrive during the night, the contest of the next day would
be unequal and the Confederates would risk losing all that they had
gained.Moreover, Beauregard's army, with its long, muddy march from
Corinth and its more than twelve hours' continuous fighting, was worn and
weary almost to exhaustion.The Union army was stunned and bleeding, but not disabled, at the close of
the first day's battle.Caught unawares, the men had made a noble stand.Though pressed back from their position and obliged to huddle for the
night around the Landing, while thousands of their comrades had fallen on
the gory field, they had hopes of heavy reenforcements during the night.And, indeed, early in the evening the cry ran along the Union lines that
Buell's army had come.The advance guard had arrived late in the afternoon
and had assisted Hurlbut in the closing scene on the bluff of Dill's
ravine; others continued to pour in during the night.And, furthermore,
General Lew Wallace's division, though it had taken a wrong road from
Crump's Landing and had not reached the field in time for the fighting of
the 6th, now at last had arrived.Buell and Wallace had brought with them
twenty-five thousand fresh troops to be hurled on the Confederates on the
morning of the 7th.The preponderance of
numbers now was with the Union army.Everyone knew that the battle was not over, that the issue must be
decided on the coming day, and the weary thousands of both sides sank down
on the ground in a drenching rain to get a little rest and to gain a
little strength for the desperate struggle that was sure to come on the
morrow.Beauregard rested hopes upon a fresh dispatch announcing that Buell was
delayed and the dreaded junction of two Federal armies therefore
impossible.Meanwhile Grant and Buell were together in Sherman's camp and
it was decided that Buell's troops should attack Beauregard next morning.One division of Buell stood to arms all night.At the break of day on Monday, April 7th, all was astir in both camps on
the field of Shiloh, and the dawn was greeted with the roar of cannon.The
troops that Grant now advanced into the contest were all, except about ten
thousand, the fresh recruits that Wallace and Buell had brought, while the
Confederates had not a single company that had not been on the ground the
day before.Some military historians believe that Beauregard would have
won a signal victory if neither army had been reenforced during the night.But now under the changed conditions the Confederates were at a great
disadvantage, and yet they fought for eight long hours with heroic valor.The deafening roar of the cannon that characterized the beginning of the
day's battle was followed by the rattle of musketry, so continuous that no
ear could distinguish one shot from another.Nelson's division of Buell's
army was the first to engage the Confederates.Nelson commanded the
Federal left wing, with Hardee and Breckinridge immediately opposed to
him.The Union center was under the command of Generals McCook and
Crittenden; the right wing was commanded by McClernand, with Hurlbut next,
while Sherman and Lew Wallace occupied the extreme right.The Confederate
left wing was commanded by the doughty Bragg and next to him was General
Polk.Shiloh Church was again the storm center and in it General Beauregard
made his headquarters.Hour after hour the columns in blue and gray surged
to and fro, first one then the other gaining the advantage and presently
losing it.At times the smoke of burning powder enveloped the whole field
and hid both armies from view.The interesting incidents of this day of
blood would fill a volume.General Hindman of the Southern side had a
novel experience.His horse was struck by a bursting shell and torn to a
thousand fragments.The general, thrown ten feet high, fell to the ground,
but leaped to his feet unhurt and asked for another horse.Early in the afternoon, Beauregard became convinced that he was fighting a
losing battle and that it would be the part of prudence to withdraw the
army before losing all.He thereupon sent the members of his staff to the
various corps commanders ordering them to prepare to retreat from the
field, at the same time making a show of resuming the offensive.The
retreat was so skilfully made, the front firing-line being kept intact,
that the Federals did not suspect it for some time.Some hours before
nightfall the fighting had ceased.The Federals remained in possession of
the field and the Confederates were wading through the mud on the road to
Corinth.It was a dreary march for the bleeding and battered Confederate army.An
eye-witness described it in the following language:

"I made a detour from the road on which the army was retreating that I
might travel faster and get ahead of the main body.In this ride of twelve
miles alongside of the routed army, I saw more of human agony and woe than
I trust I will ever again be called upon to witness.The retreating host
wound along a narrow and almost impassable road, extending some seven or
eight miles in length.Here was a line of wagons loaded with wounded,
piled in like bags of grain, groaning and cursing; while the mules plunged
on in mud and water belly-deep, the water sometimes coming into the
wagons.Next came a straggling regiment of infantry, pressing on past the
wagons; then a stretcher borne on the shoulders of four men, carrying a
wounded officer; then soldiers staggering along, with an arm broken and
hanging down, or other fearful wounds, which were enough to destroy life.And, to add to the horrors of the scene, the elements of heaven marshaled
their forces--a fitting accompaniment of the tempest of human desolation
and passion which was raging.A cold, drizzling rain commenced about
nightfall, and soon came harder and faster, then turned to pitiless,
blinding hail.I passed
long wagon trains filled with wounded and dying soldiers, without even a
blanket to shelter them from the driving sleet and hail, which fell in
stones as large as partridge eggs, until it lay on the ground two inches
deep."Some three hundred men died during that awful retreat, and their bodies
were thrown out to make room for others who, although wounded, had
struggled on through the storm, hoping to find shelter, rest, and medical
care."Four days after the battle, however, Beauregard reported to his
government, "this army is more confident of ultimate success than before
its encounter with the enemy."Addressing the soldiers, he said: "You have
done your duty.... Your countrymen are proud of your deeds on the bloody
field of Shiloh; confident in the ultimate result of your valor."The news of these two fearful days at Shiloh was astounding to the
American people.Never before on the continent had there been anything
approaching it.Bull Run was a skirmish in comparison with this gigantic
conflict.The losses on each side exceeded ten thousand men.General Grant
tells us that after the second day he saw an open field so covered with
dead that it would have been possible to walk across it in any direction
stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.American
valor was tried to the full on both sides at Shiloh, and the record shows
that it was equal to the test.[Illustration: GENERAL A. S. JOHNSTON, C. S.A brilliant Southern leader, whose early loss was a hard blow to the
Confederacy, Albert Sidney Johnston was a born fighter with a natural
genius for war.A West Pointer of the Class of '26, he had led a strenuous
and adventurous life.In the early Indian wars, in the border conflicts in
Texas, and in the advance into Mexico, he had always proved his worth, his
bravery and his knowledge as a soldier.At the outbreak of the Civil War
he had already been brevetted Brigadier-General, and had been commander of
the military district of Utah.An ardent Southerner, he made his choice,
dictated by heart and conscience, and the Federal authorities knew the
loss they would sustain and the gain that would be given to the cause of
the Confederacy.In '61 he was assigned to a district including Kentucky
and Tennessee with the rank of General.At once he displayed his gifts as
an organizer, but Shiloh cut short a career that would have led him to a
high place in fame and history.The early Confederate successes of the 6th
of April were due to his leadership.His manner of death and his way of
meeting it attested to his bravery.Struck by a minie ball, he kept in the
saddle, falling exhausted and dying from the loss of blood.His death put
the whole South into mourning.[Illustration: CAMP OF THE NINTH MISSISSIPPI.Southern soldiers in shirtsleeves a few months before they fought bravely

To no one who was close to him in the stirring scenes of the early
conflict in the West did Grant pay higher tribute than to this veteran of
the Mexican War who was his Chief of Staff.He was a man to be relied upon
in counsel and in emergency, a fact that the coming leader recognized from
the very outset.An artillery officer and engineer, his military training
and practical experience made him a most valuable executive.He had also
the gift of leading men and inspiring confidence.Always cool and
collected in the face of danger, and gifted with a personality that won
friends everywhere, the reports of all of his superiors show the trust and
confidence that were reposed in him.In April, 1861, he had taken charge
of the fortifications at Cairo, Illinois.He was with Grant at Paducah, at
Forts Henry and Donelson, and at Shiloh where he collected the artillery
near the Landing that repelled the final Confederate attack on April 6th.He remained Chief of Staff until October, 1862.On October 14th, he was
made a Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and was appointed superintendent
of military railroads in the Department of Tennessee.Later he was Chief
of Staff to General Sherman, and again proved his worth when he was with
General Thomas at Hood's defeat before Nashville in December, 1864.On
March 13, 1865, he received the brevet of Major-General of Volunteers.[Illustration: WAITING FOR THE SMELL OF POWDER--CONFEDERATES BEFORE SHILOH

PITTSBURG LANDING--A FEW DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]By the name of "Pittsburg Landing," this Tennessee River point,
Southerners designate the conflict of April 6 and 7, 1862.The building
upon the left and one farther up the bank were the only ones standing at
the time of the battle.Of the six steamers, the name of the _Tycoon_,
which brought hospital supplies from the Cincinnati branch of the Sanitary
Commission, is visible.Johnston's plan in the attack on the Federal
forces was to pound away on their left until they were driven away from
the Landing and huddled in the angle between the Tennessee River and Snake
Creek.The onset of the Confederates was full of dash.Sherman was at
length driven from Shiloh Church, and the command of Prentiss was
surrounded and forced to surrender.It looked as if Johnston would crush
the left.Just at this point he was struck down by a minie-ball from the
last line of a Federal force that he had victoriously driven back.The
success of the day now begins to tell on the Confederate army.But the men in gray push vigorously toward the
point where these boats lie anchored.Some heavy guns are massed near this
point.Reenforcements are arriving across the river, but General
Beauregard, who succeeds Johnston in command, suspends the battle till the
morrow.During the night 24,000 fresh troops are taken across the river by
the transports here pictured.They successfully withstand the attempt of
Beauregard, and with the arrival of Lew Wallace from up the river victory
shifts to the Stars and Stripes.THE GUNBOATS AT SHILOH

In the river near Pittsburg Landing, where the Federal transports lay,
were two small gunboats, and what they did during the battle of April 6th
makes a separate chapter in the action.In the early morning they were out
of sight, though within sound of the continuous firing.How the battle was
going, however, was evident.The masses of the blue-clad troops appeared
through the trees on the river bank, showing that under the continuous and
fierce assaults they were falling back upon the Landing.The _Tyler_,
commanded by Lieutenant Gwin, and afterward the _Lexington_, commanded by
Lieutenant Shirk, which arrived at four o'clock, strove to keep the
Confederate army from the Landing.After the surrender of Prentiss,
General Withers set his division in motion to the right toward this point.Chalmers' and Jackson's brigades marched into the ravine of Dill's Branch
and into the range of the Federal gunboats and batteries which silenced
Gage's battery, the only one Withers had, and played havoc with the
Confederate skirmishers.All the rest of the afternoon, until nightfall,
the river sailors kept up their continuous bombardment, and in connection
with the field batteries on the bank checked General Withers' desperate
attempt on the Landing.The dauntless brigade of Chalmers, whose brave
Southerners held their ground near the foot of the ravine and maintained
the conflict after the battle was ended elsewhere, was swept by the
gunboats' fire.When Buell's army, that had been hurrying up to Grant's
assistance, reached the battle-field, Gwin sent a messenger ashore in the
evening to General Nelson, who had just arrived, and asked in what manner
he could now be of service.It was pitch dark; except for the occasional
firing of the pickets the armies were resting after the terrific combat.In reply to Gwin's inquiry, General Nelson requested that the gunboats
keep on firing during the night, and that every ten minutes an 8-inch
shell should be launched in the direction of the Confederate camp.With
great precision Gwin followed out this course.Through the forest the
shells shrieked and exploded over the exhausted Confederates, showering
branches and limbs upon them where they slept, and tearing great gashes in
the earth.The result was that they got little rest, and rest was
necessary.Slowly a certain demoralization became evident--results that
bore fruit in the action that opened on the morrow.Here we see
pictured--in the lower part of the page--the captain's gig and crew near
the _Lexington_, ready to row their commander out into the stream.[Illustration: THE _LEXINGTON_]

[Illustration: FOURTEENTH IOWA VETERANS

AT LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, IN 1862, ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In the battle of Shiloh the Fourteenth Iowa Infantry formed part of that
self-constituted forlorn hope which made the victory of April 7, 1862,
possible.It held the center at the "Hornet's Nest," fighting the
live-long day against fearful odds.Just as the sun was setting, Colonel
William T. Shaw, seeing that he was surrounded and further resistance
useless, surrendered the regiment.These officers and men were held as
prisoners of war until October 12, 1862, when, moving by Richmond,
Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland, they went to Benton Barracks, Missouri,
being released on parole, and were declared exchanged on the 19th of
November.This photograph was taken while they were held at Richmond,
opposite the cook-houses of Libby Prison.The third man from the left in
the front row, standing with his hand grasping the lapel of his coat, is
George Marion Smith, a descendant of General Marion of Revolutionary fame.It is through the courtesy of his son, N. H. Smith, that this photograph
appears here.The Fourteenth Iowa Infantry was organized at Davenport and
mustered in November 6, 1861.At Shiloh the men were already veterans of
Forts Henry and Donelson.Those who were not captured fought in the battle
of Corinth, and after the prisoners were exchanged they took part in the
Red River expedition and several minor engagements.They were mustered out
November 16, 1864, when the veterans and recruits were consolidated in two
companies and assigned to duty in Springfield, Illinois, till August,
1865.These two companies were mustered out on August 8th.The regiment
lost during service five officers and fifty-nine enlisted men killed and
mortally wounded, and one officer and 138 enlisted men by disease.Iowa
sent nine regiments of cavalry, four batteries of light artillery and
fifty-one regiments of infantry to the Union armies, a grand total of
76,242 soldiers.[Illustration: THE MOUNTED POLICE OF THE WEST.]Stalwart horsemen such as these bore the brunt of keeping order in the
turbulent regions fought over by the armies in the West.The bugle call,
"Boots and Saddles!"might summon them to fight, or to watch the movements
of the active Confederates, Van Dorn and Price.It was largely due to
their daring and bravery that the Confederate forces were held back from
the Mississippi so as not to embarrass the movements of Grant and the
gunboats.Of this unattached cavalry of the Army of the Ohio were the men

is here lying near Memphis.Thus appeared the Federal gunboats on June 5,
1862, two miles above the city.Fort Pillow had been abandoned the
previous day, but the Confederate river-defense flotilla still remained
below and the Federals, still smarting from the disaster inflicted on the
"Cincinnati," were determined to bring on a decisive engagement and, if
possible, clear the river of their antagonists.Meanwhile four new vessels
had joined the Federal squadron.These were river steamers which Charles
Ellet, Jr., had converted into rams in the short space of six weeks.Their
principle was as old as history, but it was now to be tried for the first
time in aid of the Federal cause.On these heights above the river the
inhabitants of Memphis were crowded on the morning of June 6, 1862, as the
Federal squadron moved down-stream against the Confederate gunboats that
were drawn up in double line of battle opposite the city.Everyone wanted
to see the outcome of the great fight that was impending, for if its
result proved adverse to the Confederates, Memphis would fall into Federal
hands and another stretch of the Mississippi would be lost to the South.In the engagement at Memphis two of the Ellet rams accompanied the
squadron--the "Queen of the West" commanded by Charles Ellet, and the
"Monarch" commanded by his younger brother, Major Alfred Ellet.The
Confederate flotilla was destroyed, but with the loss of Charles Ellet,
from a mortal wound.[Illustration: MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE ON THE HEIGHTS]

COPYRIGHT, 1911.In April, 1862, J. J. Andrews, a citizen of Kentucky and a spy in General
Buell's employment, proposed seizing a locomotive on the Western and
Atlantic Railroad at some point below Chattanooga and running it back to
that place, cutting telegraph wires and burning bridges on the way.General O. M. Mitchel authorized the plan and twenty-two men volunteered
to carry it out.On the morning of April 12th, the train they were on
stopped at Big Shanty station for breakfast.The bridge-burners (who were
in citizens' clothes) detached the locomotive and three box-cars and
started at full speed for Chattanooga, but after a run of about a hundred
miles their fuel was exhausted and their pursuers were in sight.Andrews was condemned as a spy and hanged at Atlanta,
July 7th.The others were confined at Chattanooga, Knoxville, and
afterward at Atlanta, where seven were executed as spies.Of the fourteen
survivors, eight escaped from prison; and of these, six eventually reached
the Union lines.Six were removed to Richmond and confined in Castle
Thunder until they were exchanged in 1863.The Confederates attempted to
destroy the locomotive when they evacuated Atlanta.[Illustration: BATTLE BETWEEN THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC._Painted by E. Packbauer._

[Illustration: THE BIGGEST GUN OF ALL--THE 20-INCH MONSTER FOR WHICH NO
TARGET WOULD SERVE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A photograph of the only 20-inch gun made during the war.On March 30, 1861, a 15-inch Columbiad was heralded in
_Harper's Weekly_ as the biggest gun in the world, but three years later
this was exceeded.In 1844 Lieutenant (later Brigadier-General) Thomas
Jefferson Rodman of the Ordnance Department commenced a series of tests to
find a way to obviate the injurious strains set up in the metal, by
cooling a large casting from the exterior.He finally developed his theory
of casting a gun with the core hollow and then cooling it by a stream of
water or cold air through it.So successful was this method that the War
Department, in 1860, authorized a 15-inch smooth-bore gun.General Rodman then projected his 20-inch smooth-bore gun,
which was made in 1864 under his direction at Fort Pitt, Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.It was mounted at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, very soon
afterwards, but on account of the tremendous size and destructive effect
of its projectiles it was fired only four times during the war.It was
almost impossible to get a target that would withstand the shots and leave
anything to show what had happened.These four shots were fired with 50,
75, 100 and 125 pounds of powder.The projectile weighed 1,080 pounds, and
the maximum pressure on the bore was 25,000 pounds.In March, 1867, it was
again fired four times with 125, 150, 175 and 200 pounds of powder, each
time with an elevation of twenty-five degrees, the projectile attaining a
maximum range of 8,001 yards.This is no mean record even compared with
twentieth century pieces.NEWS OF MARCH 30, 1861

    THE BIGGEST GUN IN THE WORLD.We publish on page 205 an accurate drawing of the great Fifteen-inch
    Gun at Fort Monroe, Virginia; and also a picture, from a recent

MONTHS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In this remarkable view of the "Monitor's" turret, taken in July, 1862, is
seen as clearly as on the day after the great battle the effect of the
Confederate fire upon Ericsson's novel craft.As the two vessels
approached each other about half-past eight on that immortal Sunday
morning, the men within the turret waited anxiously for the first shot of
their antagonist.It soon came from her bow gun and went wide of the mark.The "Virginia" no longer had the broadside of a wooden ship at which to
aim.Not until the "Monitor" was alongside the big ironclad at close range
came the order "Begin firing" to the men in the "cheese box."Then the
gun-ports of the turret were triced back, and it began to revolve for the
first time in battle.As soon as the guns were brought to bear, two
11-inch solid shot struck the "Virginia's" armor; almost immediately she
replied with her broadside, and Lieutenant Greene and his gunners listened
anxiously to the shells bursting against their citadel.They made no more
impression than is apparent in the picture.Confident in the protection of
their armor, the Federals reloaded with a will and came again and again to
close quarters with their adversary, hurling two great projectiles about
every eight minutes.[Illustration: MEN ON THE "MONITOR" WHO FOUGHT WITH WORDEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on the deck of the "Monitor" sit some of the men who held up the
hands of Lieutenant Worden in the great fight with the "Virginia."In the
picture, taken in July, 1862, only four months afterward, one of the nine
famous dents on the turret are visible.It required courage not only to
fight in the "Monitor" for the first time but to embark on her at all, for
she was a strange and untried invention at which many high authorities
shook their heads.But during the battle, amid all the difficulties of
breakdowns by the new untried machinery, Lieutenant S. Dana Greene coolly
directed his men, who kept up a fire of remarkable accuracy.Twenty of the
forty-one 11-inch shot fired from the "Monitor" took effect, more or less,
on the iron plates of the "Virginia."The "Monitor" was struck nine times
on her turret, twice on the pilot-house, thrice on the deck, and eight
times on the side.While Greene was fighting nobly in the turret, Worden
with the helmsman in the pilot-house was bravely maneuvering his vessel
and seeking to ram his huge antagonist.Twice he almost succeeded and both
times Greene's guns were used on the "Virginia" at point-blank range with
telling effect.Toward the close of the action Worden was blinded by a
shell striking near one of the peep-holes in the pilot-house and the
command devolved upon Greene.Worden, even in his agony of pain while the
doctor was attending his injuries, asked constantly about the progress of
the battle; and when told that the "Minnesota" was safe, he said, "Then I
can die happy."[Illustration: ADMIRAL J. L. WORDEN]


DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT THE MAN WHO DARED AT NEW ORLEANS AND MOBILE BAY

[Illustration]

"ANY MAN WHO IS PREPARED FOR DEFEAT WOULD BE HALF DEFEATED BEFORE HE
COMMENCED"

THE COMMANDER OF THE FEDERAL FLEET AT NEW ORLEANS

"Who is this Farragut?"So the younger generation of Americans must have
wondered, at the news of late January, 1862.Farragut was to have a flag
in the Gulf and was expected to capture New Orleans.Thus far in the War,
he had done nothing but sit on an obscure retiring board in the Navy
Department at Washington.But Commander David D. Porter knew him, for it
was with Porter's own father in the famous old "Essex" that Farragut as a
mere boy had proved worthy to command a fighting ship.And now it was
Porter who had recommended him for a task considered gravely dangerous by
all, foolhardy by not a few.This was no less than to pass the forts below
New Orleans, defeat a powerful and determined Confederate flotilla,
capture the city, and then sweep up the Mississippi and split the
Confederacy in two.To this Farragut rigidly held himself and the brave
men under him, when, in the dark hour before dawn of April 24, 1862, they
faced the terrible bombardment of the forts and fought their way through
the flames of fire rafts desperately maneuvered by the opposing gunboats.Next day New Orleans was Farragut's.Leaving it to the co-operating army
under General B. F. Butler, Farragut pushed on up the river, passed and
repassed the fortifications at Vicksburg, but the army needed to drive
home the wedge thus firmly entered by the navy was not yet ready.It was
another year before the sturdy blows of Farragut were effectually
supplemented ashore.[Illustration: THE MEN WHO DARED--SAILORS ON THE "HARTFORD" AFTER PASSING
THE NEW ORLEANS FORTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On this page of unwritten history McPherson and Oliver, the New Orleans
war-time photographers, have caught the crew of the staunch old "Hartford"
as they relaxed after their fiery test.In unconscious picturesqueness
grouped about the spar-deck, the men are gossiping or telling over again
their versions of the great deeds done aboard the flagship.Some have
seized the opportunity for a little plain sewing, while all are interested
in the new and unfamiliar process of "having their pictures taken."The
notable thing about the picture is the number of young faces.Only a few
of the old salts whose bearded and weather-beaten faces give evidence of
service in the old navy still remain.After the great triumph in Mobile
Bay, Farragut said of these men: "I have never seen a crew come up like
ours.They are ahead of the old set in small arms, and fully equal to them
at the great guns.They arrived here a mere lot of boys and young men, and
have now fattened up and knocked the nine-inch guns about like twenty-four
pounders, to the astonishment of everybody.There was but one man who
showed fear and he was allowed to resign.This was the most desperate
battle I ever fought since the days of the old 'Essex.'""It was the
anxious night of my life," wrote Farragut later.The spar-deck shown below
recalls another speech."Don't flinch from that fire, boys!There is a
hotter fire for those who don't do their duty!"So shouted Farragut with
his ship fast aground and a huge fire-raft held hard against her wooden
side by the little Confederate tug "Mosher."The ship seemed all ablaze
and the men, "breathing fire," were driven from their guns.Farragut,
calmly pacing the poop deck, called out his orders, caring nothing for the
rain of shot from Fort St.The men, inspired by such coolness,
leaped to their stations again and soon a shot pierced the boiler of the
plucky "Mosher" and sank her.[Illustration: SPAR-DECK OF THE "HARTFORD"]




THE FIGHT FOR RICHMOND


A shattered and discomfited army were the hosts of McDowell when they
reached the banks of the Potomac, after that ill-fated July Sunday at Bull
Run.Dispirited by the sting of defeat, this motley and unorganized mass
of men became rather a mob than an army.The transformation of this chaos
of demoralization into the trained, disciplined, and splendid troops of
the Grand Army of the Potomac, was a triumph of the "young Napoleon"--Gen.Fresh from his victories in the mountains of
West Virginia, he was called to Washington to transmute 200,000 American
citizens, fresh from shop and farm, into soldiers.For months it was "drill, drill."Public opinion grew restless at the cry
"All's Quiet Along the Potomac."At last, on March 17th, McClellan moved.On April 5th the Union army was advancing toward Richmond up the
Peninsula, but was stopped at Yorktown by the Confederate General
Magruder.Not until May 3rd were McClellan's siege guns in place.At Williamsburg the lines in Gray
stood again."Jeb" Stuart, D. H. Hill, and Jubal Early fought nobly.They
gained their object--more time for their retreating comrades.But
McClellan's fighting leaders, Hooker, Kearny and Hancock, were not to be
denied.With Yorktown and Williamsburg inscribed upon its victorious banners, the
Army of the Potomac took up again its toilsome march from Cumberland
Landing toward the Confederate capital on the James.It was the 16th of May, 1862, when the advanced corps reached White House,
the ancestral home of the Lees.On every side were fields of wheat, and,
were it not for the presence of one hundred thousand men, there was the
promise of a full harvest.It was here that General McClellan took up his
headquarters, a distance of twenty-four miles from Richmond.In the Confederate capital a panic had seized the people.As the
retreating army of Johnston sought the environs of Richmond and news of
the invading hosts was brought in, fear took possession of the inhabitants
and many wild rumors were afloat as to the probable capture of the city.But it was not a fear that Johnston would not fight.The strategic policy
of the Southern general had been to delay the advance of the Northern
army.Fortunately for him, the rainy weather proved a powerful ally.The
time had now come when he should change his position from the defensive to
the offensive.The Army of Northern Virginia had been brought to bay, and
it now turned to beat off the invaders and save its capital.On the historic Peninsula lay two of the greatest and most splendid armies
that had ever confronted each other on the field of battle.The
engagement, now imminent, was to be the first in that series of contests,
between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia, ending
three years thereafter, at Appomattox, when the war-worn veterans of gray
should lay down their arms, in honor, to the war-worn veterans of blue.The Union advance was retarded by the condition of the weather and the
roads.Between McClellan's position at White House and the waiting
Confederate army lay the Chickahominy, an erratic and sluggish stream,
that spreads itself out in wooded swamps and flows around many islands,
forming a valley from half a mile to a mile wide, bordered by low bluffs.In dry weather it is but a mere brook, but a moderate shower will cause it
to rise quickly and to offer formidable opposition to any army seeking its
passage.The valley is covered with trees whose tops reach to the level
of the adjacent highlands, thus forming a screen from either side.The
bridges crossing it had all been destroyed by the retreating army except
the one at Mechanicsville, and it was not an easy task that awaited the
forces of McClellan as they made their way across the spongy soil.The van of the Union army reached the Chickahominy on May 20th.The bridge
was gone but the men under General Naglee forded the little river,
reaching the plateau beyond, and made a bold reconnaissance before the
Confederate lines.In the meantime, newly constructed bridges were
beginning to span the Chickahominy, and the Federal army soon was crossing
to the south bank of the river.General McClellan had been promised reenforcements from the north.General
McDowell with forty thousand men had started from Fredericksburg to join
him north of the Chickahominy.For this reason, General McClellan had
thrown the right wing of his army on the north of the river while his left
would rest on the south side of the stream.This position of his army did
not escape the eagle eye of the Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston,
who believed the time had now come to give battle, and perhaps destroy the
small portion of the Union forces south of the river.Meanwhile, General "Stonewall" Jackson, in the Shenandoah, was making
threatening movements in the direction of Washington, and McDowell's
orders to unite with McClellan were recalled.The roads in and about Richmond radiate from that city like the spokes of
a wheel.One of these is the Williamsburg stage-road, crossing the
Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, only eleven miles from Richmond.It was
along this road that the Federal corps of Keyes and Heintzelman had made
their way.Their orders were "to go prepared for battle at a moment's
notice" and "to bear in mind that the Army of the Potomac has never been
checked."Parallel to this road, and about a mile to the northward, runs the
Richmond and York River Railroad.Seven miles from Richmond another
highway intersects the one from Williamsburg, known as the Nine Mile road.At the point of this intersection once grew a clump of seven pines, hence
the name of "Seven Pines," often given to the battle fought on this spot.A thousand yards beyond the pines were two farmhouses in a grove of oaks.Where the Nine Mile road crossed the railroad was
Fair Oaks Station.Southeast of Seven Pines was White Oak Swamp.Casey's division of Keyes'
corps was stationed at Fair Oaks Farm.A fifth of a mile in front lay his
picket line, extending crescent shape, from the swamp to the Chickahominy.Couch's division of the same corps was at Seven Pines, with his right wing
extending along the Nine Mile road to Fair Oaks Station.Heintzelman's
corps lay to the rear; Kearney's division guarded the railroad at Savage's
Station and Hooker's the approaches to the White Oak Swamp.It was a well-wooded region and at this time was
in many places no more than a bog.No sooner had these positions been
taken, than trees were cut to form abatis, rifle-pits were hastily dug,
and redoubts for placing artillery were constructed.The picket line lay
along a dense growth of woods.Through an opening in the trees, the
Confederate army could be seen in force on the other side of the clearing.The plans of the Confederate general were well matured.On Friday, May
30th, he gave orders that his army should be ready to move at daybreak.That night the "windows of heaven seemed to have been opened" and the
"fountains of the deep broken up."It was
the most violent storm that had swept over that region for a generation.The thunderbolts rolled without
cessation.The earth was
thoroughly drenched.From mud-soaked beds
the soldiers arose the next morning to battle.Owing to the storm the Confederates did not move so early as intended.However, some of the troops were in readiness by eight o'clock.Hour after
hour the forces of Longstreet and Hill awaited the sound of the signal-gun
that would tell them General Huger was in his position to march.It was near noon before General Hill, weary of waiting,
advanced to the front, preceded by a line of skirmishers, along the
Williamsburg road.The Union pickets were lying at the edge of the forest.The soldiers in the pits had been under arms for several hours awaiting
the attack.Suddenly there burst through the woods the soldiers of the
South.A shower of bullets fell beneath the trees and the Union pickets
gave way.On and on came the lines of gray in close columns.In front of
the abatis had been planted a battery of four guns.General Naglee with
four regiments, the Fifty-sixth and One hundredth New York and Eleventh
Maine and One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania, had gone forward, and in
the open field met the attacking army.Naglee's men charged with their bayonets and pressed the gray lines back
again to the edge of the woods.Here they were met by a furious fire of
musketry and quickly gave way, seeking the cover of the rifle-pits at Fair
Oaks Farm.In this position, for nearly three
hours the Federals waged an unequal combat against three times their
number.Then, suddenly a galling fire plowed in on them from the left.It
came from Rains' brigade, which had executed a flank movement.At the same
time the brigade of Rodes rushed toward them.The Federals saw the
hopelessness of the situation.The officers at the batteries tried to
spike their guns but were killed in the attempt.Hastily falling back,
five guns were left to be turned on them in their retreat.In another minute they would have been entirely surrounded
and captured.The next stand would be made at
Seven Pines, where Couch was stationed.The forces here had been weakened
by sending relief to Casey.The situation of the Federals was growing
critical.At the same time General Longstreet sent reenforcements to
General Hill.Couch was forced out of his position toward the right in the
direction of Fair Oaks Station and was thus separated from the main body
of the army, then in action.The Confederates pushed strongly against the Federal center.Heintzelman
came to the rescue.For an hour and a
half the lines of blue and gray surged back and forth.The Federals were
gradually giving way.The left wing, alone, next to the White Oak Swamp,
was holding its own.At the same time over at Fair Oaks Station whither Couch had been forced,
were new developments.He was about to strike the Confederate army on its
left flank, but just when the guns were being trained, there burst across
the road the troops of General G. W. Smith, who up to this time had been
inactive.These men were fresh for the fight, superior in number, and soon
overpowered the Northerners.It looked for a time as if the whole Union
army south of the Chickahominy was doomed.Over at Seven Pines the center of McClellan's army was about to be routed.Now it was that General Heintzelman personally collected about eighteen
hundred men, the fragments of the broken regiments, and took a decided
stand at the edge of the timber.But
this alone would not nor did not save the day.To the right of this new
line of battle, there was a rise of ground.From here the woods abruptly
sloped to the rear.If this elevation were once secured by the
Confederates, all would be lost and rout would be inevitable.The quick
eye of General Keyes took in the situation.He was stationed on the left;
to reach the hill would necessitate taking his men between the
battle-lines.Calling on a
single regiment to follow he made a dash for the position.The Southern
troops, divining his intention, poured a deadly volley into his ranks and
likewise attempted to reach this key to the situation.The Federals gained
the spot just in time.The new line was formed as a heavy mass of
Confederates came upon them.The tremendous Union fire was too much for
the assaulting columns, which were checked.They had forced the Federal
troops back from their entrenchments a distance of two miles, but they
never got farther than these woods.The river fog now came up as the
evening fell and the Southern troops spent the night in the captured
camps, sleeping on their arms.The Federals fell back toward the river to
an entrenched camp.Meanwhile at Fair Oaks Station the day was saved, too, in the nick of
time, for the Federals.On the north side of the Chickahominy were
stationed the two divisions of Sedgwick and Richardson, under command of
General Sumner.Scarcely had the battle opened when McClellan at his
headquarters, six miles away, heard the roar and rattle of artillery.He
was sick at the time, but he ordered General Sumner to be in readiness.At
this time there were four bridges across the river--two of them were
Bottom's Bridge and the railroad bridge.To go by either of these would
consume too much time in case of an emergency.General Sumner had himself
constructed two more bridges, lying between the others.The heavy flood of
the preceding night, which was still rising, had swept one of these
partially away.In order to save time, he put his men under arms and
marched them to the end of the upper bridge and there waited throughout
the greater part of the afternoon for orders to cross.Before them rolled
a muddy and swollen stream, above whose flood was built a rude and
unstable structure.From the other side could be distinctly heard the
roar of battle.The fate of the day and of the Army of the Potomac rested
upon these men at the end of the bridge.The possibility of crossing was doubted by everyone, including the general
himself.The bridge had been built of logs, held together and kept from
drifting by the stumps of trees.Over the river proper it was suspended by
ropes attached to trees, felled across the stream.At last the long-expected order to advance came.The men stepped upon the
floating bridge.It swayed to and fro as the solid column passed over it.Beneath the men was the angry flood which would engulf all if the bridge
should fall.Gradually the weight pressed it down between the solid stumps
and it was made secure till the army had crossed.Had the passage been
delayed another hour the flood would have rendered it impassable.Guided by the roar of battle the troops hurried on.The artillery was left
behind in the mud of the Chickahominy.The steady, rolling fire of
musketry and the boom of cannon told of deadly work in front.It was
nearly six o'clock before Sedgwick's column deployed into line in the rear
of Fair Oaks Station.Just now there was a lull in
the battle.The Confederates were gathering themselves for a vigorous
assault on their opponents' flaming front.General Joseph E. Johnston himself had immediate command.President
Jefferson Davis had come out from his capital to witness the contest.A heavy fusillade poured from
their batteries and muskets.Great rents were made in the line of blue.The openings were quickly filled and a scorching fire was
sent into the approaching columns.Again and again the charge was repeated
only to be repulsed.Then came the order to fix bayonets.Five
regiments--Thirty-fourth and Eighty-second New York, Fifteenth and
Twentieth Massachusetts and Seventh Michigan--pushed to the front.Into
the woods where the Confederates had fallen back the charge was made.Driving the Southern lines back in confusion, these dashing columns saved
the day for the Army of the Potomac.Night was now settling over the wooded field.Here and there flashes of
light could be seen among the oaks, indicating a diligent search for the
wounded.General Johnston ordered his troops to sleep on the field.A few
minutes later he was struck by a rifle-ball and almost immediately a shell
hit him, throwing him from his horse, and he was borne off the field.The
first day of the battle was over.The disability of the Southern commander made it possible for the
promotion of a new leader upon whom the fortunes of the Army of Northern
Virginia would soon rest.This was General Robert E. Lee; although the
immediate command for the next day's contest fell upon General G. W.
Smith.Early Sunday morning the battle was again in progress.The command
of Smith, near Fair Oaks Station, advanced down the railroad, attacking
Richardson, whose lines were north of it and were using the embankment as
a fortification.Longstreet's men were south of the railroad.The firing
was heavy all along this line, the opposing forces being not more than
fifty yards from each other.For an hour and a half the musketry fire was
intensely heavy.The line of gray could
not withstand the galling fire and for the first time that day fell back.But the Union line had been broken, too.Both sides
were gathering themselves for another onslaught.It was then that there
were heard loud shouts from the east of the railroad.There, coming through the woods, was a large body of Federal troops.They formed a magnificent body of soldiers and
seemed eager for the fray.Turning in on the Williamsburg road they
rapidly deployed to the right and the left.In front of them was an open
field, with a thick wood on the other side.The Confederates had posted
themselves in this forest and were waiting for their antagonists.The
Federals marched upon the field in double-quick time; their movements
became a run, and they began firing as they dashed forward.They were met
by a withering fire of field artillery and a wide gap being opened in
their ranks.They reached the edge of the woods and
as they entered its leafy shadows the tide of battle rolled in with them.The front line was lost to view in the forest, except for an occasional
gleam of arms from among the trees.The din and the clash and roar of
battle were heard for miles.It was almost
a hand-to-hand combat in the heavy forest and tangled slashings.The sound
of battle gradually subsided, then ceased except for the intermittent
reports of small arms, and the second day's fight was over.The Federal troops could
now occupy without molestation the positions they held the previous
morning.The forest paths were strewn with the dead and the dying.Many of
the wounded were compelled to lie under the scorching sun for hours before
help reached them.Every farmhouse became an improvised hospital where the
suffering soldiers lay.Many were placed upon cars and taken across the
Chickahominy.The dead soldiers, blue and
gray, found sometimes lying within a few feet of each other, were buried
on the field of battle.The two giants had met in their first great combat
and were even now beginning to gird up their loins for a desperate
struggle before the capital of the Confederacy.[Illustration: "LITTLE MAC" PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN--A ROYAL AIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911 REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A picture taken in the fall of 1861, when McClellan was at the
headquarters of General George W. Morell (who stands at the extreme left),
commanding a brigade in Fitz John Porter's Division.Morell was then
stationed on the defenses of Washington at Minor's Hill in Virginia, and
General McClellan was engaged in transforming the raw recruits in the
camps near the national capital into the finished soldiers of the Army of
the Potomac."Little Mac," as they called him, was at this time at the
height of his popularity.He appears in the center between two of his
favorite aides-de-camp--Lieut.-Cols.A. V. Colburn and N. B.

afterwards wrote a valuable "History of the Civil War."[Illustration]

RAMPARTS THAT BAFFLED McCLELLAN.(Hasty fortifications of the Confederates
at Yorktown.)It was against such fortifications as these, which Magruder
had hastily reenforced with sand-bags, that McClellan spent a month
preparing his heavy batteries.Magruder had far too few soldiers to man
his long line of defenses properly, and his position could have been taken
by a single determined attack.This rampart was occupied by the
Confederate general, D. H. Hill, who had been the first to enter Yorktown
in order to prepare it for siege.He was the last to leave it on the night
of May 3, 1862.[Illustration]

WRECKED ORDNANCE.(Gun exploded by the Confederates on General Hill's
rampart, Yorktown.)Although the Confederates abandoned 200 pieces of
ordnance at Yorktown, they were able to render most of them useless before
leaving.Hill succeeded in terrorizing the Federals with grape-shot, and
some of this was left behind.After the evacuation the ramparts were
overrun by Union trophy seekers.The soldier resting his hands upon his
musket is one of the Zouaves whose bright and novel uniforms were so
conspicuous early in the war.This spot was directly on the line of the
British fortification of 1781.[Illustration]

ordnance fell into the hands of the Confederates early in the war, through
the ill-advised and hasty abandonment of Norfolk Navy Yard by the
Federals.Many of these guns did service at Yorktown and subsequently on
the James River against the Union.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.THE CONFEDERATE COMMAND OF THE RIVER.Looking north up the river, four of the five 8-inch Columbiads composing

Confederates, the guns being spiked.The vessels in the river are
transport ships, with the exception of the frigate just off shore.[Illustration: THE GOAL--THE CONFEDERATE CAPITOL]

TWO KEEPERS OF THE GOAL

The North expected General McClellan to possess himself of this citadel of
the Confederacy in June, 1862, and it seemed likely the expectation would
be realized.In the upper picture we get a near view of the State House at
Richmond, part of which was occupied as a Capitol by the Confederate
Congress during the war.In this building were stored the records and
archives of the Confederate Government, many of which were lost during the
hasty retreat of President Davis and his cabinet at the evacuation of
Richmond, April, 1865.Below, we see the city of Richmond from afar, with
the Capitol standing out boldly on the hill.McClellan was not destined to
reach this coveted goal, and it would not have meant the fall of the
Confederacy had he then done so.When Lincoln entered the building in
1865, the Confederacy had been beaten as much by the blockade as by the
operations of Grant and Sherman with vastly superior forces.[Illustration: THE SPIRES OF RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here are the portraits of the two military leaders who were conspicuous in
the Confederate attack upon McClellan's camp at Fair Oaks.General D. H.
Hill did most of the fierce fighting which drove back the Federals on the
first day, and only the timely arrival of Sumner's troops enabled the
Federals to hold their ground.Had they failed they would have been driven
into the morasses of the Chickahominy, retreat across which would have
been difficult as the bridges were partly submerged by the swollen stream.After General Johnston was wounded, General G. W. Smith was in command
during the second day's fighting.[Illustration: GENERAL G. W. SMITH, C. S.[Illustration: GENERAL D. H. HILL, C. S.[Illustration: THE ADVANCE THAT BECAME A RETREAT]

Here, almost within sight of the goal (Richmond), we see McClellan's
soldiers preparing the way for the passage of the army and its supplies.The soil along the Chickahominy was so marshy that in order to move the
supply trains and artillery from the base at White House and across the
river to the army, corduroy approaches to the bridges had to be built.It
was well that the men got this early practice in road-building.Thanks to
the work kept up, McClellan was able to unite the divided wings of the
army almost at will.[Illustration: "REGULARS" NEAR FAIR OAKS--OFFICERS OF McCLELLAN'S HORSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.As soon as Professor Lowe's balloon soars above the top of the trees the
Confederate batteries will open upon him, and for the next few moments
shells and bullets from the shrapnels will be bursting and whistling about
his ears.Then he will pass out of the danger-zone to an altitude beyond
the reach of the Confederate artillery.After the evacuation of Yorktown,
May 4, 1862, Professor Lowe, who had been making daily observations from
his balloon, followed McClellan's divisions, which was to meet Longstreet
next day at Williamsburg.On reaching the fortifications of the abandoned
city, Lowe directed the men who were towing the still inflated balloon in
which he was riding to scale the corner of the fort nearest to his old
camp, where the last gun had been fired the night before.This fort had
devoted a great deal of effort to attempting to damage the too inquisitive
balloon, and a short time previously one of the best Confederate guns had
burst, owing to over-charging and too great an elevation to reach the high
altitude.The balloonist had witnessed the explosion and a number of
gunners had been killed and wounded within his sight.His present visit
was in order to touch and examine the pieces and bid farewell to what he
then looked upon as a departed friend.This is indicated as the same gun
on page 371.[Illustration: THE PHOTOGRAPH THE BALLOONIST RECOGNIZED FORTY-EIGHT YEARS

vital point of the battle."A close examination of this photograph will
reveal Professor Lowe's hand resting on the network of the balloon,
although his body is not in the photograph.It truly is remarkable that
Professor Lowe should have seen and recognized, nearly half a century
afterward, this photograph taken at one of the most critical moments of
his life.[Illustration: THE SLAUGHTER FIELD AT FAIR OAKS.]Over this ground the fiercest fighting of the two days' battle took place,
on May 31, 1862.Some 400 soldiers were buried here, where they fell, and
their hastily dug graves appear plainly in the picture.In the redoubt
seen just beyond the two houses was the center of the Federal line of
battle, equi-distant, about a mile and a half, from both Seven Pines and
Fair Oaks.The entrenchments near these farm dwellings were begun on May
28th by Casey's Division, 4th Corps.There was not time to finish them
before the Confederate attack opened the battle, and the artillery of
Casey's Division was hurriedly placed in position behind the incomplete
works.[Illustration: THE UNFINISHED REDOUBT.]In the smaller picture we see the inside of the redoubt at the left

artillery did telling work, handsomely repelling the attack early in the
afternoon of May 31st.Later in the day Confederate sharpshooters from
vantage points in neighboring trees began to pick off the officers and the
gunners and the redoubt had to be relinquished.The abandoned guns were
turned against the retreating Federals.[Illustration: THE "REDHOT BATTERY."COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.On the afternoon of May 31st, at Fair Oaks, the Confederates were driving

their own for the rest of the day.The guns grew so hot from constant
firing that it was only with the greatest care that they could be swabbed
and loaded.These earthworks were thrown up for McCarthy's Battery,
Company C, 1st Pennsylvania Artillery, near Savage's Station.The soldiers
nicknamed it the "Redhot Battery."[Illustration: AIMING THE GUNS AT FAIR OAKS.COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here we see the beginning of the lull in the fighting of the second day at
Fair Oaks, which it has been asserted led to a fatal delay and the ruin of
McClellan's Peninsula Campaign.The first day's battle at Fair Oaks, May
31, 1862, was decidedly a Federal reverse which would have developed into
a rout had not Sumner, crossing his troops on the perilous Grapevine
Bridge, come up in time to rally the retreating men.Here we see some of
them within the entrenchments at Fair Oaks Station on the Richmond & York
River Railroad.The order will soon come to cease firing at the end of the
second day's fighting, the result of which was to drive the Confederates
back to Richmond.The heavy rainstorm on the
night of May 30th had made the movement of artillery extremely difficult,
and McClellan wanted to complete the bridges and build entrenchments
before advancing.This delay gave the Confederates time to reorganize
their forces and place them under the new commander, Robert E. Lee, who
while McClellan lay inactive effected a junction with "Stonewall" Jackson.Then during the Seven Days' Battles Lee steadily drove McClellan from his
position, within four or five miles of Richmond, to a new position on the
James River.From this secure and advantageous water base McClellan
planned a new line of advance upon the Confederate Capital.In the smaller

THE CANNONEERS WHO KEPT UP WITH THE CAVALRY--IN THIS SWIFTEST BRANCH OF
THE SERVICE EACH MAN RIDES HORSEBACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here are drawn up Harry Benson's Battery A, of the Second United States
Artillery, and Horatio Gates Gibson's Batteries C and G, combined of the
Third United States Artillery, near Fair Oaks, Virginia.They arrived
there just too late to take part in the battle of June, 1862.By "horse
artillery," or "flying artillery" as it is sometimes called, is meant an
organization equipped usually with 10-pounder rifled guns, with all hands
mounted.In ordinary light artillery the cannoneers either ride on the
gun-carriage or go afoot.In "flying artillery" each cannoneer has a
horse.This form is by far the most mobile of all, and is best suited to
accompany cavalry on account of its ability to travel rapidly.With the
exception of the method of mounting the cannoneers, there was not any
difference between the classes of field batteries except as they were
divided between "light" and "heavy."In the photograph above no one is
riding on the gun-carriages, but all have separate mounts.Battery A of
the Second United States Artillery was in Washington in January, 1861, and
took part in the expedition for the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida.It
went to the Peninsula, fought at Mechanicsville May 23-24, 1862, and took
part in the Seven Days' battles before Richmond June 25th to July 1st.Batteries C and G of the Third United States Artillery were at San
Francisco, California, till October 1861, when they came East, and also
went to the Peninsula and served at Yorktown and in the Seven Days.THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY

    Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible, and when
    you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as
    your men have strength to follow.... The other rule is, never fight
    against heavy odds, if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your
    own force on only a part, and that the weakest part, of your enemy and
    crush it.Such tactics will win every time, and a small army may thus
    destroy a large one in detail.--_"Stonewall" Jackson._


The main move of the Union army, for 1862, was to be McClellan's advance
up the Peninsula toward Richmond.Everything had been most carefully
planned by the brilliant strategist.With the assistance of McDowell's
corps, he expected in all confidence to be in the Confederate capital
before the spring had closed.But, comprehensively as he had worked the
scheme out, he had neglected a factor in the problem which was destined in
the end to bring the whole campaign to naught.This was the presence of
"Stonewall" Jackson in the Valley of Virginia.The strategic value to the Confederacy of this broad, sheltered avenue
into Maryland and Pennsylvania was great.Along the northeasterly roads
the gray legions could march in perfect safety upon the rear of Washington
so long as the eastern gaps could be held.No wonder that the Federal
authorities, however much concerned with other problems of the war, never
removed a vigilant eye from the Valley.Jackson had taken possession of Winchester, near the foot of the Valley,
in November, 1861.The Confederate
army dwindled greatly during the winter.At the beginning of March there
were but forty-five hundred men.With Banks and his forty thousand now on
Virginia soil at the foot of the Valley, and Fremont's army approaching
the head, why should the Federal commander even think about this
insignificant fragment of his foe?But the records of war have shown that
a small force, guided by a master mind, sometimes accomplishes more in
effective results than ten times the number under a less active and able
commander.The presence of Banks compelled Jackson to withdraw to Woodstock, fifty
miles south of Winchester.If McClellan ever experienced any anxiety as to
affairs in the Valley, it seems to have left him now, for he ordered Banks
to Manassas on March 16th to cover Washington, leaving General Shields and
his division of seven thousand men to hold the Valley.When Jackson heard
of the withdrawal, he resolved that, cut off as he was from taking part in
the defense of Richmond, he would do what he could to prevent any
aggrandizement of McClellan's forces.Shields hastened to his station at Winchester, and Jackson, on the 23d of
March, massed his troops at Kernstown, about three miles south of the
former place.Deceived as to the strength of his adversary, he led his
weary men to an attack on Shields' right flank about three o'clock in the
afternoon.He carried the ridge where the Federals were posted, but the
energy of his troops was spent, and they had to give way to the reserves
of the Union army after three hours of stubborn contest.The Federal ranks
were diminished by six hundred; the Confederate force by more than seven
hundred.Kernstown was a Union victory; yet never in history did victory
bring such ultimate disaster upon the victors.At Washington the alarm was intense over Jackson's audacious attack.Williams' division of Banks' troops was halted on its way to Manassas and
sent back to Winchester.Lincoln transferred Blenker's division, nine
thousand strong, to Fremont.These things were done at once, but they were
by no means the most momentous consequence of Kernstown.The President
began to fear that Jackson's goal was Washington.After consulting six of
his generals he became convinced that McClellan had not arranged proper
protection for the city.Therefore, McDowell and his corps of thirty-seven
thousand men were ordered to remain at Manassas.The Valley grew to
greater importance in the Federal eyes.Banks was made entirely
independent of McClellan and the defense of this region became his sole
task.McClellan, to his great chagrin, saw his force depleted by forty-six
thousand men.There were now four Union generals in the East operating
independently one of the other.General Ewell with eight thousand troops on the upper Rappahannock and
General Johnson with two brigades were now ordered to cooperate with
Jackson.Schenck and Milroy, of
Fremont's corps, began to threaten Johnson.Banks, with twenty thousand,
was near Harrisonburg.The Confederate leader left General Ewell to watch Banks while he made a
dash for Milroy and Schenck.He fought them at McDowell on May 8th and
they fled precipitately to rejoin Fremont.The swift-acting Jackson now
darted at Banks, who had fortified himself at Strasburg.Jackson stopped
long enough to be joined by Ewell.He did not attack Strasburg, but stole
across the Massanutten Mountain unknown to Banks, and made for Front
Royal, where a strong Union detachment was stationed under Colonel Kenly.Early on the afternoon of May 23d, Ewell rushed from the forest.Kenly and
his men fled before them toward Winchester.A large number were captured
by the cavalry before they had gotten more than four miles away.Banks at Strasburg realized that Jackson was approaching from the rear,
the thing he had least expected and had made no provision for.There was nothing to be done but
retreat to Winchester.Even that was prevented by the remarkable speed of
Jackson's men, who could march as much as thirty-five miles a day.On May
24th, the Confederates overtook and struck the receding Union flank near
Newtown, inflicting heavy loss and taking many prisoners.Altogether,
three thousand of Banks' men fell into Jackson's hands.This exploit was most opportune for the Southern arms.It caused the final
ruin of McClellan's hopes.Banks received one more attack from Ewell's
division the next day as he passed through Winchester on his way to the
shelter of the Potomac.He crossed at Williamsport late the same evening
and wrote the President that his losses, though serious enough, might have
been far worse "considering the very great disparity of forces engaged,
and the long-matured plans of the enemy, which aimed at nothing less than
entire capture of our force."Lincoln now rescinded his resolution to
send McDowell to McClellan.Instead, he transferred twenty thousand of the
former's men to Fremont and informed McClellan that he was not, after all,
to have the aid of McDowell's forty thousand men.Fremont was coming from the west; Shields lay in the other direction, but
Jackson was not the man to be trapped.He managed to hold Fremont while he
marched his main force quickly up the Valley.At Port Republic he drove
Carroll's brigade of Shields' division away and took possession of a
bridge which Colonel Carroll had neglected to burn.Fremont in pursuit was
defeated by Ewell at Cross Keys.Jackson immediately put his force of
twelve thousand over the Shenandoah at Port Republic and burned the
bridge.Safe from the immediate attack by Fremont, he fell upon Tyler and
Carroll, who had not more than three thousand men between them.The
Federals made a brave stand, but after many hours' fighting were compelled
to retreat.Jackson emerged through Swift Run Gap on the 17th of June, to
assist in turning the Union right on the Peninsula, and Banks and Shields,
baffled and checkmated at every move, finally withdrew from the Valley.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON AT WINCHESTER 1862

here upon the features of Thomas Jonathan Jackson precisely as that
brilliant Lieutenant-General of the Confederate States Army appeared
during his masterly "Valley Campaign" of 1862.Few photographers dared to
approach this man, whose silence and modesty were as deep as his mastery
of warfare.Indeed, his plans were rarely
known even to his immediate subordinates, and herein lay the secret of
those swift and deadly surprises that raised him to first rank among the
world's military figures.Jackson's ability and efficiency won the utter
confidence of his ragged troops; and their marvelous forced marches, their
contempt for privations if under his guidance, put into his hands a living
weapon such as no other leader in the mighty conflict had ever wielded.[Illustration: NANCY HART THE CONFEDERATE GUIDE AND SPY

among these fearless girls who knew every inch of the regions in which
they lived was Nancy Hart.So valuable was her work as a guide, so
cleverly and often had she led Jackson's cavalry upon the Federal outposts
in West Virginia, that the Northern Government offered a large reward for
her capture.Lieutenant-Colonel Starr of the Ninth West Virginia finally
caught her at Summerville in July, 1862.While in a temporary prison, she
faced the camera for the first time in her life, displaying more alarm in
front of the innocent contrivance than if it had been a body of Federal
soldiery.She posed for an itinerant photographer, and her captors placed
the hat decorated with a military feather upon her head.Nancy managed to
get hold of her guard's musket, shot him dead, and escaped on Colonel
Starr's horse to the nearest Confederate detachment.A few days later,
July 25th, she led two hundred troopers under Major Bailey to Summerville.They reached the town at four in the morning, completely surprising two
companies of the Ninth West Virginia.They fired three houses, captured
Colonel Starr, Lieutenant Stivers and other officers, and a large number
of the men, and disappeared immediately over the Sutton road.[Illustration: THE GERMAN DIVISION SENT AGAINST JACKSON

Springfield rifles from his own stores.When the combined forces met
Jackson and Ewell at Cross Keys, five of Blenker's regiments were sent

THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES

    McClellan's one hope, one purpose, was to march his army out of the
    swamps and escape from the ceaseless Confederate assaults to a point
    on James River where the resistless fire of the gunboats might protect
    his men from further attack and give them a chance to rest.To that
    end, he retreated night and day, standing at bay now and then as the
    hunted stag does, and fighting desperately for the poor privilege of
    running away.And the splendid fighting of his men was a tribute to the skill and
    genius with which he had created an effective army out of what he had
    described as "regiments cowering upon the banks of the Potomac, some
    perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat, others going home."Out of a demoralized and disorganized mass reenforced by utterly
    untrained civilians, McClellan had within a few months created an army
    capable of stubbornly contesting every inch of ground even while
    effecting a retreat the very thought of which might well have
    disorganized an army.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History of the
    Confederate War."_


General Lee was determined that the operations in front of Richmond should
not degenerate into a siege, and that the Army of Northern Virginia should
no longer be on the defensive.To this end, early in the summer of 1862,
he proceeded to increase his fighting force so as to make it more nearly
equal in number to that of his antagonist.Every man who could be spared
from other sections of the South was called to Richmond.Numerous
earthworks soon made their appearance along the roads and in the fields
about the Confederate capital, giving the city the appearance of a
fortified camp.The new commander in an address to the troops said that
the army had made its last retreat.Meanwhile, with the spires of Richmond in view, the Army of the Potomac
was acclimating itself to a Virginia summer.The whole face of the country
for weeks had been a veritable bog.Now that the sweltering heat of June
was coming on, the malarious swamps were fountains of disease.The
polluted waters of the sluggish streams soon began to tell on the health
of the men.Malaria and typhoid were prevalent; the hospitals were
crowded, and the death rate was appalling.Such conditions were not inspiring to either general or army.McClellan
was still hoping for substantial reenforcements.McDowell, with his forty
thousand men, had been promised him, but he was doomed to disappointment
from that source.Yet in the existing state of affairs he dared not be
inactive.South of the Chickahominy, the army was almost secure from
surprise, owing to well-protected rifle-pits flanked by marshy thickets or
covered with felled trees.But the Federal forces were still divided by
the fickle stream, and this was a constant source of anxiety to the
commander.He proceeded to transfer all of his men to the Richmond side of
the river, excepting the corps of Franklin and Fitz John Porter.About the
middle of June, General McCall with a force of eleven thousand men joined
the Federal army north of the Chickahominy, bringing the entire fighting
strength to about one hundred and five thousand.So long as there remained
the slightest hope of additional soldiers, it was impossible to withdraw
all of the army from the York side of the Peninsula, and it remained
divided.That was a brilliant initial stroke of the Confederate general when he
sent his famous cavalry leader, J. E. B. Stuart, with about twelve hundred
Virginia troopers, to encircle the army of McClellan.Veiling his
intentions with the utmost secrecy, Stuart started June 12, 1862, in the
direction of Fredericksburg as if to reenforce "Stonewall" Jackson.The
first night he bivouacked in the pine woods of Hanover.No fires were
kindled, and when the morning dawned, his men swung upon their mounts
without the customary bugle-call of "Boots and Saddles."Turning to the
east, he surprised and captured a Federal picket; swinging around a corner
of the road, he suddenly came upon a squadron of Union cavalry.The
Confederate yell rent the air and a swift, bold charge by the Southern
troopers swept the foe on.They had not traveled far when they came again to a force drawn up in
columns of fours, ready to dispute the passage of the road.This time the
Federals were about to make the charge.A squadron of the Confederates
moved forward to meet them.Some Union skirmishers in their effort to get
to the main body of their troops swept into the advancing Confederates and
carried the front ranks of the squadron with them.These isolated
Confederates found themselves in an extremely perilous position, being
gradually forced into the Federal main body.Before they could extricate
themselves, nearly every one in the unfortunate front rank was shot or cut
down.The Southern cavalrymen swept on and presently found themselves nearing
the York River Railroad--McClellan's supply line.As they approached
Tunstall's Station they charged down upon it, with their characteristic
yell, completely surprising a company of Federal infantry stationed there.Telegraph wires were cut and a tree felled
across the track to obstruct the road.This had hardly been done before
the shriek of a locomotive was heard.A train bearing Union troops came
thundering along, approaching the station.The engineer, taking in the
situation at a glance, put on a full head of steam and made a rush for the
obstruction, which was easily brushed aside.As the train went through a
cut the Confederates fired upon it, wounding and killing some of the
Federal soldiers in the cars.Riding all through a moonlit night, the raiders reached Sycamore Ford of
the Chickahominy at break of day.As usual this erratic stream was
overflowing its banks.They started to ford it, but finding that it would
be a long and wearisome task, a bridge was hastily improvised at another
place where the passage was made with more celerity.Now, on the south
bank of the river, haste was made for the confines of Richmond, where, at
dawn of the following day, the troopers dropped from their saddles, a
weary but happy body of cavalry.Lee thus obtained exact and detailed information of the position of
McClellan's army, and he laid out his campaign accordingly.Meanwhile his
own forces in and about Richmond were steadily increasing.He was planning
for an army of nearly one hundred thousand and he now demonstrated his
ability as a strategist.Word had been despatched to Jackson in the
Shenandoah to bring his troops to fall upon the right wing of McClellan's
army.At the same time Lee sent General Whiting north to make a feint of
joining Jackson and moving upon Washington.The authorities at Washington were frightened, and McClellan
received no more reenforcements.Jackson now began a hide-and-seek game
among the mountains, and managed to have rumors spread of his army being
in several places at the same time, while skilfully veiling his actual
movements.It was not until the 25th of June that McClellan had definite knowledge of
Jackson's whereabouts.He was then located at Ashland, north of the
Chickahominy, within striking distance of the Army of the Potomac.McClellan was surprised but he was not unprepared.Seven days before he
had arranged for a new base of supplies on the James, which would now
prove useful if he were driven south of the Chickahominy.On the very day he heard of Jackson's arrival at Ashland, McClellan was
pushing his men forward to begin his siege of Richmond--that variety of
warfare which his engineering soul loved so well.His advance guard was
within four miles of the Confederate capital.His strong fortifications
were bristling upon every vantage point, and his fond hope was that within
a few days, at most, his efficient artillery, for which the Army of the
Potomac was famous, would be belching forth its sheets of fire and lead
into the beleagured city.In front of the Union encampment, near Fair
Oaks, was a thick entanglement of scrubby pines, vines, and ragged bushes,
full of ponds and marshes.This strip of woodland was less than five
hundred yards wide.Beyond it was an open field half a mile in width.The
Union soldiers pressed through the thicket to see what was on the other
side and met the Confederate pickets among the trees.Upon emerging into the open, the Federal troops found it
filled with rifle-pits, earthworks, and redoubts.At once they were met
with a steady and incessant fire, which continued from eight in the
morning until five in the afternoon.At times the contest almost reached
the magnitude of a battle, and in the end the Union forces occupied the
former position of their antagonists.This passage of arms, sometimes
called the affair of Oak Grove or the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, was the
prelude to the Seven Days' Battles.The following day, June 26th, had been set by General "Stonewall" Jackson
as the date on which he would join Lee, and together they would fall upon
the right wing of the Army of the Potomac.The Federals north of the
Chickahominy were under the direct command of General Fitz John Porter.Defensive preparations had been made on an extensive scale.Field works,
heavily armed with artillery, and rifle-pits, well manned, covered the
roads and open fields and were often concealed by timber from the eye of
the opposing army.The extreme right of the Union line lay near
Mechanicsville on the upper Chickahominy.A tributary of this stream from
the north was Beaver Dam Creek, upon whose left bank was a steep bluff,
commanding the valley to the west.This naturally strong position, now
well defended, was almost impregnable to an attack from the front.Before sunrise of the appointed day the Confederate forces were at the
Chickahominy bridges, awaiting the arrival of Jackson.To reach these some
of the regiments had marched the greater part of the night.Noon passed and
Jackson had not arrived.At three o'clock, General A. P. Hill, growing
impatient, decided to put his troops in motion.Crossing at Meadow Bridge,
he marched his men along the north side of the Chickahominy, and at
Mechanicsville was joined by the commands of Longstreet and D. H. Hill.Driving the Union outposts to cover, the Confederates swept across the low
approach to Beaver Dam Creek.A murderous fire from the batteries on the
cliff poured into their ranks.Gallantly the attacking columns withstood
the deluge of leaden hail and drew near the creek.A few of the more
aggressive reached the opposite bank but their repulse was severe.Later in the afternoon relief was sent to Hill, who again attempted to
force the Union position at Ellerson's Mill, where the <DW72> of the west
bank came close to the borders of the little stream.From across the open
fields, in full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates moved
down the <DW72>.They were in range of the Federal batteries, but the fire
was reserved.Every artilleryman was at his post ready to fire at the
word; the soldiers were in the rifle-pits sighting along the glittering
barrels of their muskets with fingers on the triggers.As the approaching
columns reached the stream they turned with the road that ran parallel to
the bank.From every waiting field-piece the shells came screaming through the air.Volley after volley of musketry was poured into the flanks of the marching
Southerners.The hillside was soon covered with the victims of the gallant
charge.Twilight fell upon the warring troops and there were no signs of a
cessation of the unequal combat.Night fell, and still from the heights
the lurid flames burst in a display of glorious pyrotechnics.It was nine
o'clock when Hill finally drew back his shattered regiments, to await the
coming of the morning.The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered most in
the fight; three hundred and thirty-five being the dreadful toll, in dead
and wounded, paid for its efforts to break down the Union position.Dropping back to the rear this ill-fated regiment attempted to re-form its
broken ranks, but its officers were all among those who had fallen.Both
armies now prepared for another day and a renewal of the conflict.The action at Beaver Dam Creek convinced McClellan that Jackson was really
approaching with a large force, and he decided to begin his change of base
from the Pamunkey to the James, leaving Porter and the Fifth Corps still
on the left bank of the Chickahominy, to prevent Jackson's fresh troops
from interrupting this great movement.It was, indeed, a gigantic
undertaking, for it involved marching an army of a hundred thousand men,
including cavalry and artillery, across the marshy peninsula.A train of
five thousand heavily loaded wagons and many siege-guns had to be
transported; nearly three thousand cattle on the hoof had to be driven.From White House the supplies could be shipped by the York River Railroad
as far as Savage's Station.Thence to the James, a distance of seventeen
miles, they had to be carried overland along a road intersected by many
others from which a watchful opponent might easily attack.General Casey's
troops, guarding the supplies at White House, were transferred by way of
the York and the James to Harrison's Landing on the latter river.The
transports were loaded with all the material they could carry.The rest
was burned, or put in cars.These cars, with locomotives attached, were
then run into the river.On the night of June 26th, McCall's Federal division, at Beaver Dam Creek,
was directed to fall back to the bridges across the Chickahominy near
Gaines' Mill and there make a stand, for the purpose of holding the
Confederate army.During the night the wagon trains and heavy guns were
quietly moved across the river.Just before daylight the operation of
removing the troops began.The Confederates were equally alert, for about
the same time they opened a heavy fire on the retreating columns.This
march of five miles was a continuous skirmish; but the Union forces, ably
and skilfully handled, succeeded in reaching their new position on the
Chickahominy heights.The morning of the new day was becoming hot and sultry as the men of the
Fifth Corps made ready for action in their new position.The selection of
this ground had been well made; it occupied a series of heights fronted on
the west by a sickle-shaped stream.The battle-lines followed the course
of this creek, in the arc of a circle curving outward in the direction of
the approaching army.The land beyond the creek was an open country,
through which Powhite Creek meandered sluggishly, and beyond this a wood
densely tangled with undergrowth.Around the Union position were also many
patches of wooded land affording cover for the troops and screening the
reserves from view.Porter had learned from deserters and others that Jackson's forces, united
to those of Longstreet and the two Hills, were advancing with grim
determination to annihilate the Army of the Potomac.He had less than
eighteen thousand men to oppose the fifty thousand Confederates.To
protect the Federals, trees had been felled along a small portion of their
front, out of which barriers protected with rails and knapsacks were
erected.Porter had considerable artillery, but only a small part of it
could be used.It was two o'clock, on June 27th, when General A. P. Hill
swung his division into line for the attack.He was unsupported by the
other divisions, which had not yet arrived, but his columns moved rapidly
toward the Union front.The assault was terrific, but twenty-six guns
threw a hail-storm of lead into his ranks.Under the cover of this
magnificent execution of artillery, the infantry sent messages of death to
the approaching lines of gray.The Confederate front recoiled from the incessant outpour of grape,
canister, and shell.The heavy cloud of battle smoke rose lazily through
the air, twisting itself among the trees and settling over the forest like
a pall.The tremendous momentum of the repulse threw the Confederates into
great confusion.Men were separated from their companies and for a time it
seemed as if a rout were imminent.The Federals, pushing out from under
the protection of their great guns, now became the assailants.The
Southerners were being driven back.Others threw themselves on the ground to escape the withering fire, while
some tenaciously held their places.General
Slocum arrived with his division of Franklin's corps, and his arrival
increased the ardor of the victorious Federals.It was then that Lee ordered a general attack upon the entire Union front.Reenforcements were brought to take the place of the shattered regiments.The engagement began with a sharp artillery fire from the Confederate
guns.Then the troops moved forward, once more to assault the Union
position.In the face of a heavy fire they rushed across the sedgy
lowland, pressed up the hillside at fearful sacrifice and pushed against
the Union front.It was a death grapple for the mastery of the field.General Lee, sitting on his horse on an eminence where he could observe
the progress of the battle, saw, coming down the road, General Hood, of
Jackson's corps, who was bringing his brigade into the fight.Riding
forward to meet him, Lee directed that he should try to break the line.Hood, disposing his men for the attack, sent them forward, but, reserving
the Fourth Texas for his immediate command, he marched it into an open
field, halted, and addressed it, giving instructions that no man should
fire until ordered and that all should keep together in line.The forward march was sounded, and the intrepid Hood, leading his men,
started for the Union breastworks eight hundred yards away.They moved at
a rapid pace across the open, under a continually increasing shower of
shot and shell.At every step the ranks grew thinner and thinner.As they
reached the crest of a small ridge, one hundred and fifty yards from the
Union line, the batteries in front and on the flank sent a storm of shell
and canister plowing into their already depleted files.They quickened
their pace as they passed down the <DW72> and across the creek.Not a shot
had they fired and amid the sulphurous atmosphere of battle, with the wing
of death hovering over all, they fixed bayonets and dashed up the hill
into the Federal line.With a shout they plunged through the felled timber
and over the breastworks.The Union line had been pierced and was giving
way.It was falling back toward the Chickahominy bridges, and the retreat
was threatening to develop into a general rout.The twilight was closing
in and the day was all but lost to the Army of the Potomac.Now a great
shout was heard from the direction of the bridge and, pushing through the
stragglers at the river bank were seen the brigades of French and Meagher,
detached from Sumner's corps, coming to the rescue.General Meagher, in
his shirt sleeves, was leading his men up the bluff and confronted the
Confederate battle line.This put a stop to the pursuit and as night was
at hand the Southern soldiers withdrew.The battle of Gaines' Mill, or the
Chickahominy, was over.When Lee came to the banks of the little river the next morning he found
his opponent had crossed over and destroyed the bridges.The Army of the
Potomac was once more united.During the day the Federal wagon trains were
safely passed over White Oak Swamp and then moved on toward the James
River.Lee did not at first divine McClellan's intention.He still
believed that the Federal general would retreat down the Peninsula, and
hesitated therefore to cross the Chickahominy and give up the command of
the lower bridges.But now on the 29th the signs of the movement to the
James were unmistakable.Early on that morning Longstreet and A. P. Hill
were ordered to recross the Chickahominy by the New Bridge and Huger and
Magruder were sent in hot pursuit of the Federal forces.It was the brave
Sumner who covered the march of the retreating army, and as he stood in
the open field near Savage's Station he looked out over the plain and saw
with satisfaction the last of the ambulances and wagons making their way
toward the new haven on the James.In the morning of that same day he had already held at bay the forces of
Magruder at Allen's Farm.On his way from Fair Oaks, which he left at
daylight, he had halted his men at what is known as the "Peach Orchard,"
and from nine o'clock till eleven had resisted a spirited fire of musketry
and artillery.And now as the grim warrior, on this Sunday afternoon in
June, turned his eyes toward the Chickahominy he saw a great cloud of dust
rising on the horizon.It was raised by the troops of General Magruder who
was pressing close behind the Army of the Potomac.The Southern field-guns
were placed in position.A contrivance, consisting of a heavy gun mounted
on a railroad car and called the "Land Merrimac," was pushed into position
and opened fire upon the Union forces.The battle began with a fine play
of artillery.For an hour not a musket was fired.The army of blue
remained motionless.Then the mass of gray moved across the field and from
the Union guns the long tongues of flame darted into the ranks before
them.The charge was met with vigor and soon the battle raged over the
entire field.Both sides stood their ground till darkness again closed the
contest, and nearly eight hundred brave men had fallen in this Sabbath
evening's battle.Before midnight Sumner had withdrawn his men and was
following after the wagon trains.The Confederates were pursuing McClellan's army in two columns, Jackson
closely following Sumner, while Longstreet was trying to cut off the Union
forces by a flank movement.On the last day of June, at high noon, Jackson
reached the White Oak Swamp.He attempted to ford
the passage, but the Union troops were there to prevent it.While Jackson
was trying to force his way across the stream, there came to him the sound
of a desperate battle being fought not more than two miles away, but he
was powerless to give aid.Longstreet and A. P. Hill had come upon the Federal regiments at Glendale,
near the intersection of the Charles City road, guarding the right flank
of the retreat.It was Longstreet who, about half-past two, made one of
his characteristic onslaughts on that part of the Union army led by
General McCall.Each brigade seemed to act on its own behalf.They hammered
here, there, and everywhere.Repulsed at one place they charged at
another.The Eleventh Alabama, rushing out from behind a dense wood,
charged across the open field in the face of the Union batteries.The men
had to run a distance of six hundred yards.A heavy and destructive fire
poured into their lines, but on they came, trailing their guns.The
batteries let loose grape and canister, while volley after volley of
musketry sent its death-dealing messages among the Southerners.But
nothing except death itself could check their impetuous charge.When two
hundred yards away they raised the Confederate yell and rushed for
Randol's battery.Pausing for an instant they deliver a volley and attempt to seize the
guns.Bayonets are crossed and men engage in a hand-to-hand struggle.The
contending masses rush together, asking and giving no quarter and
struggling like so many tigers.Darkness is closing on the fearful scene,
yet the fighting continues with unabated ferocity.There are the shouts of
command, the clash and the fury of the battle, the sulphurous smoke, the
flashes of fire streaking through the air, the yells of defiance, the
thrust, the parry, the thud of the clubbed musket, the hiss of the bullet,
the spouting blood, the death-cry, and beneath all lie the bodies of
America's sons, some in blue and some in gray.While Lee and his army were held in check by the events of June 30th at
White Oak Swamp and the other battle at Glendale or Nelson's Farm, the
last of the wagon trains had arrived safely at Malvern Hill.The contest
had hardly closed and the smoke had scarcely lifted from the blood-soaked
field, when the Union forces were again in motion toward the James.By
noon on July 1st the last division reached the position where McClellan
decided to turn again upon his assailants.He had not long to wait, for
the Confederate columns, led by Longstreet, were close on his trail, and a
march of a few miles brought them to the Union outposts.They found the
Army of the Potomac admirably situated to give defensive battle.Malvern
Hill, a plateau, a mile and a half long and half as broad, with its top
almost bare of woods, commanded a view of the country over which the
Confederate army must approach.Along the western face of this plateau
there are deep ravines falling abruptly in the direction of the James
River; on the north and east is a gentle <DW72> to the plain beneath,
bordered by a thick forest.Around the summit of the hill, General
McClellan had placed tier after tier of batteries, arranged like an
amphitheater.Surmounting these on the crest were massed seven of his
heaviest siege-guns.His army surrounded this hill, its left flank being
protected by the gunboats on the river.The morning and early afternoon were occupied with many Confederate
attacks, sometimes formidable in their nature, but Lee planned for no
general move until he could bring up a force that he considered sufficient
to attack the strong Federal position.The Confederate orders were to
advance when the signal, a yell, cheer, or shout from the men of
Armistead's brigade, was given.Late in the afternoon General D. H. Hill heard some shouting, followed by
a roar of musketry.No other general seems to have heard it, for Hill made
his attack alone.It was gallantly done, but no army could have withstood
the galling fire of the batteries of the Army of the Potomac as they were
massed upon Malvern Hill.All during the evening, brigade after brigade
tried to force the Union lines.The gunners stood coolly and manfully by
their batteries.The Confederates were not able to make concerted efforts,
but the battle waxed hot nevertheless.They were forced to breast one of
the most devastating storms of lead and canister to which an assaulting
army has ever been subjected.The round shot and grape cut through the
branches of the trees and the battle-field was soon in a cloud of smoke.Column after column of Southern soldiers rushed up to the death-dealing
cannon, only to be mowed down.The thinned and ragged lines, with a valor
born of desperation, rallied again and again to the charge, but to no
avail.The batteries on the heights still hurled their missiles of death.The field below was covered with the dead and wounded of the Southland.The gunboats in the river made the battle scene more awe-inspiring with
their thunderous cannonading.Their heavy shells shrieked through the
forest, and great limbs were torn from the trees as they hurtled by in
their outburst of fury.The combatants were no longer distinguishable except by
the sheets of flame.It was nine o'clock before the guns ceased their
fire, and only an occasional shot rang out over the bloody field of
Malvern Hill.The courageous though defeated Confederate, looking up the next day
through the drenching rain to where had stood the embrasured wall with its
grim batteries and lines of blue, that spoke death to so many of his
companions-in-arms, saw only deserted ramparts.The Union army had
retreated in the darkness of the night.But this time no foe harassed its
march.Unmolested, it sought its new camp at Harrison's Landing, where it
remained until August 3d, when, as President Lincoln had been convinced of
the impracticability of operating from the James River as a base, orders
were issued by General Halleck for the withdrawal of the Army of the
Potomac from the Peninsula.The net military result of the Seven Days was a disappointment to the
South.Although thankful that the siege of Richmond had been raised, the
Southern public believed that McClellan should not have been allowed to
reach the James River with his army intact."That army," Eggleston states, "splendidly organized, superbly equipped,
and strengthened rather than weakened in morale, lay securely at rest on
the James River, within easy striking distance of Richmond.There was no
knowing at what moment McClellan might hurl it again upon Richmond or upon
that commanding key to Richmond--the Petersburg position.In the hands of
a capable commander McClellan's army would at this time have been a more
serious menace than ever to the Confederate capital, for it now had an
absolutely secure and unassailable base of operations, while its fighting
quality had been improved rather than impaired by its seven days of
battling."General Lee's own official comment on the military problem involved and
the difficulties encountered was: "Under ordinary circumstances the
Federal army should have been destroyed.Its escape was due to the causes
already stated.Prominent among these is the want of correct and timely
information.This fact, attributable chiefly to the character of the
country, enabled General McClellan skilfully to conceal his retreat and to
add much to the obstructions with which nature had beset the way of our
pursuing columns; but regret that more was not accomplished gives way to
gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the results
achieved."Whatever the outcome of the Seven Days' Battle another year was to
demonstrate beyond question that the wounding of General Johnston at Fair
Oaks had left the Confederate army with an even abler commander.On such a
field as Chancellorsville was to be shown the brilliancy of Lee as leader,
and his skilful maneuvers leading to the invasion of the North.And the
succeeding volume will tell, on the other hand, how strong and compact a
fighting force had been forged from the raw militia and volunteers of the
North.[Illustration: McDOWELL AND McCLELLAN--TWO UNION LEADERS WHOSE PLANS
"STONEWALL" JACKSON FOILED

COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In General McClellan's plan for the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, General
McDowell, with the First Army Corps of 37,000 men, was assigned a most
important part, that of joining him before Richmond.Lincoln had
reluctantly consented to the plan, fearing sufficient protection was not
provided for Washington.By the battle of Kernstown, March 23d, in the
Valley of Virginia, Jackson, though defeated, so alarmed the
Administration that McDowell was ordered to remain at Manassas to protect
the capital.The reverse at Kernstown was therefore a real triumph for
Jackson, but with his small force he had to keep up the game of holding
McDowell, Banks, and Fremont from reenforcing McClellan.If he failed,
80,000 troops might move up to Richmond from the west while McClellan was
approaching from the North.But Jackson, on May 23d and 25th, surprised
Banks' forces at Front Royal and Winchester, forcing a retreat to the
Potomac.At the news of this event McDowell was ordered not to join
McClellan in front of Richmond.[Illustration: JOHNSTON AND LEE--A PHOTOGRAPH OF 1869._Copyright by Review of Reviews Co._]

These men look enough alike to be brothers.They were so in arms, at West
Point, in Mexico and throughout the war.General Joseph E. Johnston (on
the left), who had led the Confederate forces since Bull Run, was wounded
at Fair Oaks.That wound gave Robert E. Lee (on the right) his opportunity
to act as leader.After Fair Oaks, Johnston retired from the command of
the army defending Richmond.The new commander immediately grasped the
possibilities of the situation which confronted him.The promptness and
completeness with which he blighted McClellan's high hopes of reaching
Richmond showed at one stroke that the Confederacy had found its great
general.It was only through much sifting that the North at last picked
military leaders that could rival him in the field.[Illustration: THE FLEET THAT FED THE ARMY]

White House Landing came the steam and sailing vessels laden with supplies
for McClellan's second attempt to reach Richmond.Tons of ammunition and
thousands of rations were sent forward from here to the army on the
Chickahominy in June, 1862.A short month was enough to cause McClellan to
again change his plans, and the army base was moved to the James River.The Richmond and York Railroad was lit up by burning cars along its course
to the Chickahominy.Little was left to the Confederates save the charred
ruins of the White House itself.[Illustration: ELLERSON'S MILL--WHERE HILL ASSAULTED.]Not until after nightfall of June 26, 1862, did the Confederates of
General A. P. Hill's division cease their assaults upon this position
where General McCall's men were strongly entrenched.Time after time the
Confederates charged over the ground we see here at Ellerson's Mill, near
Mechanicsville.Till 9 o'clock at night they continued to pour volleys at
the position, and then at last withdrew.The victory was of little use to
the Federals, for Jackson on the morrow, having executed one of the
flanking night marches at which he was an adept, fell upon the Federal
rear at Gaines' Mill.[Illustration: THE WASTE OF WAR

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Railroad trains loaded with tons of food and ammunition were run
deliberately at full speed off the embankment shown in the left

was the readiest means that McClellan could devise for keeping his immense
quantity of stores out of the hands of the Confederates in his hasty
change of base from White House to the James after Gaines' Mill.This was
the bridge of the Richmond and York River Railroad, and was destroyed June
28, 1862, to render the railroad useless to the Confederates.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THAT STOOD]

The force under General McCall was stationed by McClellan on June 19,
1862, to observe the Meadow and Mechanicsville bridges over the
Chickahominy which had only partially been destroyed.On the afternoon of
June 26th, General A. P. Hill crossed at Meadow Bridge, driving the Union
skirmish-line back to Beaver Dam Creek.The divisions of D. H. Hill and
Longstreet had been waiting at Mechanicsville Bridge (shown in this
photograph) since 8 A.M.for A. P. Hill to open the way for them to cross.They passed over in time to bear a decisive part in the Confederate attack
at Gaines' Mill on the 27th.[Illustration: DOING DOUBLE DUTY

regular officers of ripe experience that members of the staff were
invariably made regimental commanders, and frequently were compelled to
divide their time between leading their troops into action and reporting
to and consulting with their superior.[Illustration: THE RETROGRADE CROSSING.][Illustration: LOWER BRIDGE ON THE CHICKAHOMINY

engineers suspect, when they built this bridge, early in June, 1862, as a
means of communication between the divided wings of McClellan's army on
the Chickahominy that it would be of incalculable service during battle.When the right wing, under General Fitz John Porter, was engaged on the
field of Gaines' Mill against almost the entire army of Lee, across this
bridge the division of General Slocum marched from its position in the
trenches in front of Richmond on the south bank of the river to the
support of Porter's men.The battle lasted until nightfall and then the
Federal troops moved across this bridge and rejoined the main forces of
the Federal army.Woodbury's engineers built several bridges across the
Chickahominy, but among them all the bridge named for their commander
proved to be, perhaps, the most serviceable.[Illustration: A VAIN RIDE TO SAFETY]

During the retreat after Gaines' Mill, McClellan's army was straining
every nerve to extricate itself and present a strong front to Lee before
he could strike a telling blow at its untenable position.Wagon trains
were struggling across the almost impassable White Oak Swamp, while the
troops were striving to hold Savage's Station to protect the movement.Thither on flat cars were sent the wounded as we see them in the picture.The rear guard of the Army of the Potomac had hastily provided such field
hospital facilities as they could.We see the camp near the railroad with
the passing wagon trains in the lower picture.But attention to these
wounded men was, perforce, secondary to the necessity of holding the
position.Their hopes of relief from their suffering were to be blighted.Lee was about to fall upon the Federal rear guard at Savage's Station.Instead of to a haven of refuge, these men were being railroaded toward
the field of carnage, where they must of necessity be left by their
retreating companions.[Illustration: THE STAND AT SAVAGE'S STATION

rifled gun, mounted on car-wheels.They turned its deadly fire steadily
upon the defenders.The Federals fought fiercely and managed to hold their
ground till nightfall, when hundreds of their bravest soldiers lay on the
field and had to be left alone with their wounded comrades who had arrived
on the flat cars.[Illustration: A GRIM CAPTURE

sufferings of the men that had to be abandoned.Here we see them at work
upon the wounded, who have been gathered from the field.Nothing but the
strict arrest of the stern sergeant Death can save these men from capture,
and when the Confederates occupied Savage's Station on the morning of June
30th, twenty-five hundred sick and wounded men and their medical
attendants became prisoners of war.The Confederate hospital facilities
were already taxed to their full capacity in caring for Lee's wounded, and
most of these men were confronted on that day with the prospect of
lingering for months in the military prisons of the South.The brave
soldiers lying helpless here were wounded at Gaines' Mill on June 27th and
removed to the great field-hospital established at Savage's Station.The

Through this well-nigh impassable morass of White Oak Swamp, across a
single long bridge, McClellan's wagon trains were being hurried the last
days of June, 1862.On the morning of the 30th, the rear-guard of the army
was hastily tramping after them, and by ten o'clock had safely crossed and
destroyed the bridge.They had escaped in the nick of time, for at noon
"Stonewall" Jackson opened fire upon Richardson's division and a terrific
artillery battle ensued for the possession of this, the single crossing by
which it was possible to attack McClellan's rear.The Federal batteries
were compelled to retire but Jackson's crossing was prevented on that day
by the infantry.[Illustration: HEROES OF MALVERN HILL]

after the victory of July 1, 1862, and the army marched to a new base
farther down the James, where the heavy losses of men and supplies during
the Seven Days could be made up without danger and delay.Harrison's
Landing was the point selected, and here the army recuperated, wondering
what would be the next step.Below we see the historic mansion which did

completed the withdrawal of his army to Harrison's Landing.It was his
duty to watch the movements of the Confederates and hold them back from
any attempt to fall upon the retreating trains and troops.A dense fog in
the early morning shut off the forces of A. P. Hill and Longstreet from
his view.He had not a single fieldpiece with which to resist attack.When
the mist cleared away, he kept up a great activity with his cavalry
horses, making the Confederates believe that artillery was being brought
up.With apparent reluctance he agreed to a truce of two hours in which
the Confederates might bury the dead they left on the hillside the day
before.Later, with an increased show of unwillingness, he extended the
truce for another two hours.Just before they expired, Frank's Battery
arrived to his support, with the news that the Army of the Potomac was
safe.Colonel Averell rejoined it without the loss of a man.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY]

AFTER THE SEVEN DAYS

Within a week of the occupation of Harrison's Landing, McClellan's
position had become so strong that the Federal commander no longer
anticipated an attack by the Confederate forces.General Lee saw that his
opponent was flanked on each side by a creek and that approach to his
front was commanded by the guns in the entrenchments and those of the
Federal navy in the river.Lee therefore deemed it inexpedient to attack,
especially as his troops were in poor condition owing to the incessant
marching and fighting of the Seven Days.Rest was what both armies needed
most, and on July 8th the Confederate forces returned to the vicinity of
Richmond.McClellan scoured the country before he was satisfied of the
Confederate withdrawal.The Third and Fourth Pennsylvania cavalry made a
reconnaisance to Charles City Court House and beyond, and General Averell
reported on July 11th that there were no Southern troops south of the
lower Chickahominy.His scouting expeditions extended in the direction of
Richmond and up the Chickahominy.[Illustration: CHARLES CITY COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA, JULY, 1862

THE FEDERAL DEFENDER OF CORINTH

[Illustration]

THE MAN WHO KEPT THE KEY IN THE WEST

GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS

The possession of Corinth, Miss., meant the control of the railroads
without which the Federal armies could not push down the Mississippi
Valley and eastward into Tennessee.Autumn found Rosecrans with about
23,000 men in command at the post where were vast quantities of military
stores.On October 3, the indomitable Confederate leaders, Price and Van
Dorn, appeared before Corinth, and Rosecrans believing the movement to be
a feint sent forward a brigade to an advanced position on a hill.A sharp
battle ensued and in a brilliant charge the Confederates at last possessed
the hill.Convinced that there was really to be a determined assault on
Corinth, Rosecrans disposed his forces during the night.Just before dawn
the Confederate cannonade began, the early daylight was passed in
skirmishing, while the artillery duel grew hotter.Then a glittering
column of Price's men burst from the woods.Grape and canister were poured
into them, but on they came, broke through the Federal center and drove
back their opponents to the square of the town.Here the Confederates were
at last swept back.But ere that Van Dorn's troops had hurled themselves
on Battery Robinett to the left of the Federal line, and fought their way
over the parapet and into the battery.Federal
troops well placed in concealment rose up and poured volley after volley
into them.Rosecrans by a
well-planned defense had kept the key to Grant's subsequent control of the
West.[Illustration: GENERAL EARL VAN DORN, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDER AT CORINTH

General Earl Van Dorn was born in Mississippi in 1821; he was graduated
from West Point in 1842, and was killed in a personal quarrel in 1863.Early in the war General Van Dorn had distinguished himself by capturing
the steamer "Star of the West" at Indianola, Texas.He was of a
tempestuous nature and had natural fighting qualities.During the month of
August he commanded all the Confederate troops in Mississippi except those
under General Price, and it was his idea to form a combined movement with
the latter's forces and expel the invading Federals from the northern
portion of his native State and from eastern Tennessee.The concentration
was made and the Confederate army, about 22,000 men, was brought into the
disastrous battle of Corinth.Brave were the charges made on the
entrenched positions, but without avail.[Illustration: GENERAL STERLING PRICE, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE SECOND IN COMMAND

but early allied himself with the cause of the Confederacy.At Pea Ridge,
only seven months before the battle of Corinth, he had been wounded.Of
the behavior of his men, though they were defeated and turned back on the
4th, he wrote that it was with pride that sisters and daughters of the
South could say of the officers and men, "My brother, father, fought at
Corinth."General Van Dorn, in referring to
the end of that bloody battle, wrote these pathetic words: "Exhausted from
loss of sleep, wearied from hard marching and fighting, companies and
regiments without officers, our troops--let no one censure them--gave way.[Illustration: BEFORE THE SOD HID THEM

[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN POPE]

THE UNFORTUNATE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA

A SWIFT TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL

Perhaps there is no more pathetic figure in the annals of the War than
Pope.In the West, that fiery furnace where the North's greatest generals
were already being molded, he stood out most prominently in the Spring of
1862.At Washington, the administration was cudgeling its brains for means
to meet the popular clamor for an aggressive campaign against Lee after
the Peninsula fiasco.Pope was sent for and arrived in Washington in June.When the plan to place him at the head of an army whose three corps
commanders all outranked him, was proposed, he begged to be sent back
West.But he was finally persuaded to undertake a task, the magnitude of
which was not yet appreciated at the North.During a month of preparation
he was too easily swayed by the advice and influenced by the plans of
civilians, and finally issued a flamboyant address to his army ending with
the statement, "My headquarters will be in the saddle."When this was
shown to Lee, he grimly commented, "Perhaps his headquarters will be where
his hindquarters ought to be."There followed the brief campaign, the
stunning collision with the solid front of Stonewall Jackson at Cedar
Mountain, and the clever strategy that took Pope at a disadvantage on the
old battlefield of Bull Run.Thence his army retreated more badly beaten
from a military standpoint than the rout which fled the same field a year
before.A brief summer had marked the rise and fall of Pope.Two years
later Sherman bade good-bye to his friend Grant also summoned from the
West."Remember Pope," was the gist of his warning; "don't stay in
Washington; keep in the field."CEDAR MOUNTAIN

    The Army of Virginia, under Pope, is now to bear the brunt of Lee's
    assault, while the Army of the Potomac is dismembered and sent back
    whence it came, to add in driblets to Pope's effective.--_Colonel
    Theodore A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye View of the Civil War."_


General George B. McClellan, with all his popularity at the beginning, had
failed in his Peninsula campaign to fulfil the expectations of the great
impatient public of the North.At the same time, while the Army of the
Potomac had as yet won no great victories, the men of the West could
triumphantly exhibit the trophies won at Donelson, at Pea Ridge, at
Shiloh, and at Island No.The North thereupon came to believe that the
Western leaders were more able than those of the East.This belief was
shared by the President and his Secretary of War and it led to the
determination to call on the West for help.The first to be called was General John Pope, who had won national fame by
capturing New Madrid and Island No.In answer
to a telegram from Secretary Stanton, Pope came to Washington in June,
1862.The secretary disclosed the plans on which he and President Lincoln
had agreed, that a new army, to be known as the Army of Virginia, was to
be created out of three corps, then under the respective commands of
Generals McDowell, N. P. Banks, and John C. Fremont.These corps had been
held from the Peninsula campaign for the purpose of protecting Washington.Pope demurred and begged to be sent back to the West, on the ground that
each of the three corps commanders was his senior in rank and that his
being placed at their head would doubtless create a feeling against him.But his protests were of no avail and he assumed command of the Army of
Virginia on the 26th of June.McDowell and Banks made no protest; but
Fremont refused to serve under one whom he considered his junior, and
resigned his position.His corps was assigned to General Franz Sigel.The new commander, General Pope, on the 14th of July, issued an address to
his army that was hardly in keeping with his modesty in desiring at first
to decline the honor that was offered him."I have come to you from the
West," he proclaimed, "where we have always seen the backs of our
enemies--from an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and
to beat him when found.... Meantime I desire you to dismiss from your
minds certain phrases which I am sorry to find much in vogue among you.I
hear constantly of... lines of retreat and bases of supplies.Let us
discard such ideas.... Let us look before us and not behind."The immediate object of General Pope was to make the capital secure, to
make advances toward Richmond, and, if possible, to draw a portion of
Lee's army away from McClellan.From
this town, not far from the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was a
railroad connecting it with Richmond--a convenient means of furnishing men
and supplies to the Confederate army.Pope decided to occupy the town and
destroy the railroad.To this end he ordered Banks to Culpeper and thence
to send all his cavalry to Gordonsville, capture the town and tear up ten
or fifteen miles of the railroad in the direction of Richmond.But, as if
a prelude to the series of defeats which General Pope was to suffer in the
next six weeks, he failed in this initial movement.The sagacious Lee had
divined his intention and had sent General "Stonewall" Jackson with his
and General Ewell's divisions on July 13th, to occupy Gordonsville.Ewell
arrived in advance of Jackson and held the town for the Confederates.In the campaign we are describing Jackson was the most active and
conspicuous figure on the Confederate side.He rested at Gordonsville for
two weeks, recuperating his health and that of the army, which had been
much impaired in the malarial district of the Peninsula.The fresh
mountain air blowing down from the Blue Ridge soon brought back their
wonted vigor.On July 27th A. P. Hill was ordered to join him, and the
Confederate leader now had about twenty-five thousand men.The movement on Gordonsville was exactly in accordance with Jackson's own
ideas which he had urged upon Lee.Although believing McClellan to be in
an impregnable position on the Peninsula, it was not less evident to him
that the Union general would be unable to move further until his army had
been reorganized and reenforced.This was the moment, he argued, to strike
in another direction and carry the conflict into the Federal territory.An
army of at least sixty thousand should march into Maryland and appear
before the National Capital.President Davis could not be won over to the
plan while McClellan was still in a position to be reenforced by sea, but
Lee, seeing that McClellan remained inactive, had determined, by sending
Jackson westward, to repeat the successful tactics of the previous spring
in the Shenandoah valley.Such a move might result in the recall of
McClellan.No sooner had Halleck assumed command of all the
Northern armies than the matter of McClellan's withdrawal was agitated and
on August 3d the head of the Army of the Potomac, to his bitter
disappointment, was ordered to join Pope on the Rappahannock.Halleck was
much concerned as to how Lee would act during the Federal evacuation of
the Peninsula, uncertain whether the Confederates would attempt to crush
Pope before McClellan could reenforce him, or whether McClellan would be
attacked as soon as he was out of his strong entrenchments at Harrison's
Landing.The latter of the two possibilities seemed the more probable, and Pope was
therefore ordered to push his whole army toward Gordonsville, in the hope
that Lee, compelled to strengthen Jackson, would be too weak to fall upon
the retiring Army of the Potomac.The Union army now occupied the great triangle formed roughly by the
Rappahannock and the Rapidan rivers and the range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains, with Culpeper Court House as the rallying point.Pope soon
found that the capturing of New Madrid and Island No.10 was easy in
comparison with measuring swords with the Confederate generals in the
East.On August 6th Pope began his general advance upon Gordonsville.Banks
already had a brigade at Culpeper Court House, and this was nearest to
Jackson.The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means
of which Pope's army of forty-seven thousand men would be united.Jackson,
informed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for
Culpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of
the Army of Virginia.The remainder of Banks's
corps reached Culpeper on the 8th.On the morning of the 9th Jackson
finally got his troops over the Rapidan and the Robertson rivers.Two
miles beyond the latter stream there rose from the plain the <DW72> of
Slaughter Mountain, whose ominous name is more often changed into Cedar.This "mountain" is an isolated foothill of the Blue Ridge, some twenty
miles from the parent range, and a little north of the Rapidan.From its
summit could be seen vast stretches of quiet farmlands which had borne
their annual harvests since the days of the Cavaliers.Its gentle <DW72>s
were covered with forests, which merged at length into waving grain fields
and pasture lands, dotted here and there with rural homes.It was here on
the <DW72> of Cedar Mountain that one of the most severe little battles of
the war took place.On the banks of Cedar Run, seven miles south of Culpeper and but one or
two north of the mountain, Banks's cavalry were waiting to oppose
Jackson's advance.Learning of this the latter halted and waited for an
attack.He placed Ewell's batteries on the <DW72> about two hundred feet
above the valley and sent General Winder to take a strong position on the
left.So admirably was Jackson's army stationed that it would have
required a much larger force, approaching it from the plains, to dislodge
it.And yet, General Banks made an attempt with an army scarcely one-third
as large as that of Jackson.General Pope had made glowing promises of certain success and he well knew
that the whole North was eagerly watching and waiting for him to fulfil
them.He must strike somewhere and do it soon--and here was his chance at
Cedar Mountain.He sent Banks with nearly eight thousand men against this
brilliant Southern commander with an army three times as large, holding a
strong position on a mountain side.Banks with his infantry left Culpeper Court House on the morning of August
9th and reached the Confederate stronghold in the afternoon.He approached
the mountain through open fields in full range of the Confederate cannon,
which presently opened with the roar of thunder.All heedless of danger
the brave men ran up the <DW72> as if to take the foe by storm, when
suddenly they met a brigade of Ewell's division face to face and a brief,
deadly encounter took place.In a few minutes the Confederate right flank
began to waver and would no doubt have been routed but for the timely aid
of another brigade and still another that rushed down the hill and opened
fire on the Federal lines which extended along the eastern bank of Cedar
Run.Meanwhile the Union batteries had been wheeled into position and their
deep roar answered that of the foe on the hill.For two or three hours the
battle continued with the utmost fury.The ground was strewn with dead and
dying and human blood was poured out like water.But the odds were too
great and at length, as the shades of evening were settling over the gory
field, Banks began to withdraw the remnant of his troops.But he left two
thousand of his brave lads--one fourth of his whole army--dead or dying
along the hillside, while the Confederate losses were in excess of
thirteen hundred.The dead and wounded of both armies lay mingled in masses over the whole
battle-field.While the fighting continued, neither side could send aid or
relief to the maimed soldiers, who suffered terribly from thirst and lack
of attention as the sultry day gave place to a close, oppressive night.General Pope had remained at Culpeper, but, hearing the continuous
cannonading and knowing that a sharp engagement was going on, hastened to
the battle-field in the afternoon with a fresh body of troops under
General Ricketts, arriving just before dark.He instantly ordered Banks to
withdraw his right wing so as to make room for Ricketts; but the
Confederates, victorious as they had been, refused to continue the contest
against the reenforcements and withdrew to the woods up the mountain side.Heavy shelling was kept up by the hard-worked artillerymen of both armies
until nearly midnight, while the Federal troops rested on their arms in
line of battle.For two days the armies faced each other across the
valley.Pope's first battle as leader of an
Eastern army had resulted in neither victory nor defeat.[Illustration: A BREATHING SPELL

McClellan went to the Peninsula in March of 1862 he had expected all of
McDowell's Corps to be sent him as reenforcement before he made the final
advance on Richmond.But the brilliant exploits of Jackson in the
Shenandoah required the retention of all the troops in the vicinity of
Washington.A new army, in fact, was created to make the campaign which
Lincoln had originally wanted McClellan to carry out.The command was
given to General John Pope, whose capture of Island No.10 in the
Mississippi had brought him into national importance.The corps of Banks,
Fremont, and McDowell were consolidated to form this new army, called the
"Army of Virginia."General Fremont refused to serve under his junior, and
his force was given to Franz Sigel, who had won fame in 1861 in Missouri.This picture was taken about two weeks after the reorganization was
completed.The soldiers are those of McDowell's Corps.They are on the old
battlefield of Bull Run, enjoying the leisure of camp life, for no
definite plans for the campaign have yet been formed.[Illustration: WHERE JACKSON STRUCK]

The Hero of the Federal Attack.General Samuel W. Crawford, here seen with
his staff, at Cedar Mountain led a charge on the left flank of the
Confederate forces that came near being disastrous for Jackson.At about
six o'clock the brigade was in line.General Williams reported: "At this
time this brigade occupied the interior line of a strip of woods.A field,
varying from 250 to 500 yards in width, lay between it and the next strip
of woods.In moving across this field the three right regiments and the
six companies of the Third Wisconsin were received by a terrific fire of
musketry.The Third Wisconsin especially fell under a partial flank fire
under which Lieut.-Colonel Crane fell and the regiment was obliged to give
way.Of the three remaining regiments which continued the charge
(Twenty-eighth New York, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania, and Fifth Connecticut)
every field-officer and every adjutant was killed or disabled.In the
Twenty-eighth New York every company officer was killed or wounded; in the
Forty-sixth Pennsylvania all but five; in the Fifth Connecticut all but
eight."It was one of the most heroic combats of the war.ALFRED N. DUFFIE]

A Leader of Cavalry.Colonel Alfred N. Duffie was in command of the First
Rhode Island Cavalry, in the Cavalry Brigade of the Second Division of
McDowell's (Third) Corps in Pope's Army of Virginia.The cavalry had been
used pretty well during Pope's advance.On the 8th of August, the day
before the battle of Cedar Mountain, the cavalry had proceeded south to
the house of Dr.That night Duffie was on picket in advance of
General Crawford's troops, which had come up during the day and pitched
camp.The whole division came to his support on the next day.When the
infantry fell back to the protection of the batteries, the cavalry was
ordered to charge the advancing Confederates."Officers and men behaved
admirably, and I cannot speak too highly of the good conduct of all of the
brigade," reported General Bayard.After the battle the cavalry covered
the retreat of the artillery and ambulances.On August 18th, when the
retreat behind the Rappahannoc was ordered, the cavalry again checked the
Confederate advance.During the entire campaign the regiment of Colonel
Duffie did yeoman's service.[Illustration: THE FIRST CLASH

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Battlefield of Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862.Here the Confederate army
in its second advance on Washington first felt out the strength massed
against it.After Lee's brilliant tactics had turned McClellan's Peninsula
Campaign into a fiasco, the Confederate Government resolved to again take
the offensive.Plans were formed for a general invasion of the North, the
objective points ranging from Cincinnati eastward to the Federal capital
and Philadelphia.Immediately after Washington got wind of this, Lincoln
(on August 4th) issued a call for three hundred thousand men, and all
haste was made to rush the forces of McClellan from the Peninsula and of
Cox from West Virginia to the aid of the recently consolidated army under
Pope.On August 9, 1862, the vanguards of "Stonewall" Jackson's army and
of Pope's intercepting forces met at Cedar Mountain.Banks, with the
Second Corps of the Federal army, about eight thousand strong, attacked
Jackson's forces of some sixteen thousand.The charge was so furious that
Jackson's left flank was broken and rolled up, the rear of the center
fired upon, and the whole line thereby thrown into confusion.Banks,
however, received no reenforcements, while Jackson received strong
support.The Federal troops were driven back across the ground which they
had swept clear earlier in the afternoon.[Illustration]

the day after the battle that had raged for a brief two hours on the
previous evening.After an artillery fire that filled half the afternoon,
the advanced Federal cavalry was pressed back on the infantry supporting
the batteries.Banks underestimated the strength of the Confederates.Instead of sending to Pope for reenforcements, he ordered a charge on the
approaching troops.The Confederates, still feeling their way, were
unprepared for this movement and were thrown into confusion.But at the
moment when the Federal charge was about to end in success, three brigades
of A. P. Hill in reserve were called up.They forced the Federals to
retrace their steps to the point where the fighting began.Here the
Federal retreat, in turn, was halted by General Pope with reenforcements.The Confederates moving up their batteries, a short-range artillery fight
was kept up until midnight.At daylight it was found that Ewell and
Jackson had fallen back two miles farther up the mountain.Pope advanced
to the former Confederate ground and rested, after burying the dead.The
following morning the Confederates had disappeared.The loss to both
armies was almost three thousand in killed, wounded and missing.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF THE FIGHTING TENTH

the neighborhood of the courthouse, and the scene was enlivened during the
sessions of court by visitors from miles around.SECOND BATTLE OF BULL RUN

    The battle was indeed one of which General Lee had good reason to be
    proud.It would be hard to find a better instance of that masterly
    comprehension of the actual condition of things which marks a great
    general than was exhibited in General Lee's allowing our formidable
    attack, in which more than half the Federal army was taking part, to
    be fully developed and to burst upon the exhausted troops of Stonewall
    Jackson, while Lee, relying upon the ability of that able soldier to
    maintain his position, was maturing and arranging for the great attack
    on our left flank by the powerful corps of Longstreet.--_John C.
    Ropes, in "The Army Under Pope."_


The battle of Cedar Mountain was but a prelude to the far greater one that
was to take place three weeks later on the banks of the little stream that
had given its name, the year before, to the first important battle of the
war; and here again the result to be registered was similar to that of the
preceding year--a result that brought dismay to the people of the North
and exultation to the adherents of the Southern cause.The three
intervening weeks between the battles of Cedar Mountain and the Second
Bull Run were spent in sparring, in marshaling the armed hosts, in heavy
skirmishing and getting position for a final decisive struggle.The respective heroes
were J. E. B. Stuart, the daring Southern cavalry leader, and "Stonewall"
Jackson.Before relating these
incidents, however, we must take a general view of the field.General
Pope's headquarters at this moment were at Culpeper, with a large part of
his army, but he had left much of his personal baggage and many of his
private papers at Catlett's, a station on the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad between Culpeper and Manassas Junction, while his vast store of
army supplies was at the latter place.Pope's great source of uncertainty lay in the fact that he did not know
whether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the
latter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the
reenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile
Lee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against
Pope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered
to the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,
ascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful
field-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles
away.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him
without delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a
courier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General
Stuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he
captured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not
in position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that
place and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had
strained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left
Culpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden
rains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing
torrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements
from the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of
Burnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came
Generals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give
their lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia
with some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his
reenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry
leader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did
this effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of
these weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with
fifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart
dashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of
night on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,
while the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread
of his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's
Station, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and
wide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and
private papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a
large number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine
uniform cloak and hat which were the personal property of General Pope.These were exchanged on the following day for General Stuart's plumed hat
which a few days before had been left behind by that officer when
surprised by Federal troops.Stuart's bold raid proved a serious misfortune for the Union army.But Lee
had far greater things in store.His next move was to send Jackson to
Pope's rear with a large part of the Confederate army.Stealthily Jackson
led his army westward, shielded by the woods, the thickets, and the low
hills of the Blue Ridge.It was a quiet rural community through which he
passed.The great majority of the simple country folk had never seen an
army, though it is true that for many days the far-away boom of cannon had
reached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real
army at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies
were Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they
cheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on
the Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to
divert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front."Stonewall" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged from the Bull Run
Mountains by way of the Thoroughfare Gap and marshaled his clans on the
plains of Manassas, but a few miles from the site of the famous battle of
the year before.He was astonished to find Jackson in his rear, and
he had to decide instantly between two courses to abandon his
communications with Fredericksburg on the one hand, or with Alexandria and
Washington on the other.He decided to keep in touch with Washington at
all hazards.Breaking his camp on the Rappahannock, he hastened with all
speed to lead his forces toward Manassas Junction, where he had stored
vast quantities of provisions and munitions of war.But he was too late to
save them.Jackson had been joined by Stuart and his cavalry.On the
evening of the 26th they were still some miles from Manassas and Trimble
was sent ahead to make sure the capture before Pope's army could arrive.Through the darkness rode these same hardy men who had a few nights before
made their bold raid on Catlett's Station.The
spoils of this capture were great, including three hundred prisoners, one
hundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of
provisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and hungry foot soldiers of Jackson's army came
upon the scene and whatever else they did they feasted as only hungry men
can.An eye-witness wrote, "To see a starving man eating lobster-salad
and drinking Rhine wine, barefooted and in tatters, was curious; the
whole thing was incredible."The amazement at the North when the news of the capture of Manassas became
known cannot be described.But the newspapers belittled it, declaring that
it was merely a bold raid and that for any large force to get between
Pope's army and Washington before Pope became aware of the attempt was
simply impossible.But his position was precarious,
nevertheless.Pope was moving toward him with a far larger army, recently
augmented by Heintzelman's corps from the Army of the Potomac, while Fitz
John Porter with an additional force was not far off.It is true that
Longstreet was hastening to the aid of Jackson, but he had to come by the
same route which had brought Jackson--through Thoroughfare Gap--and Pope
thought he saw a great opportunity.If he could only detain Longstreet at
the gap, why should he not crush Jackson with his superior numbers?To
this end he sent orders to Porter, to McDowell, and to Kearny and others
whose forces were scattered about the country, to concentrate during the
night of the 27th and move upon Jackson.McDowell sent Ricketts with a
small force--too small to prevent Longstreet from passing through
Thoroughfare Gap, and hastened to join the main army against Jackson.But
that able commander was not to be caught in a trap.He moved from Manassas
Junction by three roads toward the old battle-field of Bull Run and by
noon on the 28th the whole corps was once more united between Centreville
and Sudley Spring.Late in the day he encountered King's division of
McDowell's corps near the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up till an hour after dark.The Confederates were left in
possession of the field.The following day, August 29th, was the first of the two days' battle,
leaving out of account the fight of the evening before and the desultory
fighting of the preceding ten days.General Pope was still hopeful of
crushing Jackson before the arrival of Longstreet, and on the morning of
the 29th he ordered a general advance across Bull Run.As the noon hour
approached a wild shout that arose from Jackson's men told too well of the
arrival of Longstreet.Far away on the hills near Gainesville could be
seen the marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed through the gap in
safety and who was now rushing to the support of Jackson.The Confederate
army was at last to be reunited.Pope had
lost his opportunity of fighting the army of his opponent in sections.The field was almost the same that the opposing forces had occupied a year
and a month before when the first great battle of the war was fought.And
many of them were the same men.Some who had engaged in that first
conflict had gone home and had refused to reenlist; others had found
soldiers' graves since then--but still others on both sides were here
again, no longer the raw recruits that they were before, but, with their
year of hard experience in the field, they were trained soldiers, equal to
any in the world.The two armies faced each other in a line nearly five miles long.There
was heavy fighting here and there along the line from the early morning
hours, but no general engagement until late in the afternoon.The Union
right pressed hard against the Confederate left and by ten o'clock had
forced it back more than a mile.But the Confederates, presently
reenforced in that quarter, hurled heavy masses of infantry against the
Union right and regained much that it had lost.Late in the afternoon
fresh regiments under Kearny and Hooker charged the Confederate left,
which was swept back and rolled in upon the center.But presently the
Southern General Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed forward in a
wild, irresistible dash, pressed Kearny back, captured one gun, several
flags and a hundred prisoners.Night then closed over the scene and the
two armies rested on their arms until the morning.The first day's battle is sometimes called the battle of Groveton, but
usually it is considered as the first half of the second battle of Bull
Run.The Union loss was at least
forty-five hundred men, the Confederate was somewhat larger.Over the gory
field lay multitudes of men, the blue and the gray commingled, who would
dream of battlefields no more.The living men lay down among the dead in
order to snatch a little rest and strength that they might renew the
strife in the morning.It is a strange fact that Lee and Pope each believed that the other would
withdraw his army during the night, and each was surprised in the morning
to find his opponent still on the ground, ready, waiting, defiant.It was
quite certain that on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
action and that one of the two armies would be victor and the other
defeated.The two opposing commanders had called in their outlying
battalions and the armies now faced each other in almost full force, the
Confederates with over fifty thousand men and the Union forces exceeding
their opponents by probably fifteen thousand men.The Confederate left
wing was commanded by Jackson, and the right by Longstreet.The extreme
left of the Union army was under Fitz John Porter, who, owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, had not reached the field the day before.The
center was commanded by Heintzelman and the right by Reno.In the early hours of the morning the hills echoed with the firing of
artillery, with which the day was opened.Porter made an infantry attack
in the forenoon, but was met by the enemy in vastly superior numbers and
was soon pressed back in great confusion.As the hours passed one fearful
attack followed another, each side in turn pressing forward and again
receding.In the afternoon a large part of the Union army made a
desperate onslaught on the Confederate left under Jackson.Here for some
time the slaughter of men was fearful.Jackson saw
that his lines were wavering.He called for reenforcements which did not
come and it seemed as if the Federals were about to win a signal victory.Far away on a little hill at the Confederate right
Longstreet placed four batteries in such a position that he could enfilade
the Federal columns.Quickly he trained his cannon on the Federal lines
that were hammering away at Jackson, and opened fire.Ghastly gaps were
soon cut in the Federal ranks and they fell back.But they re-formed and
came again and still again, each time only to be mercilessly cut down by
Longstreet's artillery.At length Longstreet's whole line rushed forward,
and with the coming of darkness, the whole Union front began to waver.General Lee, seeing this, ordered the Confederates in all parts of the
field to advance.It was now dark
and there was little more fighting; but Lee captured several thousand
prisoners.Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and
by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville.There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and
the campaign.He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of
Washington.After spending a day behind the embankments at Centreville,
the retreat was begun.Lee's troops with Jackson in the advance pursued
and struck a portion of the retreating army at Chantilly.It was late in the afternoon of September 1st.The rain, accompanied by
vivid lightning and terrific crashes of thunder, was falling in torrents
as Stuart's horsemen, sent in advance, were driven back by the Federal
infantry.Jackson now pushed two of A. P. Hill's brigades forward to
ascertain the condition of the Union army.General Reno was protecting
Pope's right flank, and he lost no time in proceeding against Hill.The
latter was promptly checked, and both forces took position for battle.One side and then the other fell back in turn as lines were re-formed and
urged forward.Night fell and the tempest's fury increased.The ammunition
of both armies was so wet that much of it could not be used.Try as they
would the Confederates were unable to break the Union line and the two
armies finally withdrew.The Confederates suffered a loss of five hundred
men in their unsuccessful attempt to demoralize Pope in his retreat, and
the Federals more than a thousand, including Generals Stevens and Kearny.General Kearny might have been saved but for his reckless bravery.He was
rounding up the retreat of his men in the darkness of the night when he
chanced to come within the Confederate lines.Called on to surrender, he
lay flat on his horse's back, sank his spurs into its sides, and attempted
to escape.Half a dozen muskets were leveled and fired at the fleeing
general.Within thirty yards he rolled from his horse's back dead.The consternation in Washington and throughout the North when Pope's
defeated army reached Arlington Heights can better be imagined than
described.General Pope, who bore the brunt of public indignation, begged
to be relieved of the command.The President complied with his wishes and
the disorganized remnants of the Army of Virginia and the Army of the
Potomac were handed to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame, George B.
McClellan.The South was overjoyed with its victory--twice it had unfurled its banner
in triumph on the battlefield at Manassas by the remarkable strategy of
its generals and the courage of its warriors on the firing-line.Twice it
had stood literally on the road that led to the capital of the Republic,
only by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter its precincts on the
wave of victory.[Illustration: THE UNHEEDED WARNING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here we see Catlett's Station, on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad, which
Stuart's cavalry seized in a night sortie on August 22, 1862.Stuart was unable to burn the loaded wagon-trains
surrounding the station and had to content himself with capturing horses,
which he mounted with wounded Federal soldiers; he escaped at four the
next morning, driven off by the approach of a superior force.Pope, at the
time, was in possession of the fords of the Rappahannock, trying to check
the Confederate advance toward the Shenandoah.Stuart's raid, however, so
alarmed General Halleck that he immediately telegraphed Pope from
Washington: "By no means expose your railroad communication with
Alexandria.It is of the utmost importance in sending your supplies and
reinforcements."Pope did not fall back upon his railroad communication,
however, until after Jackson had seized Manassas Junction.[Illustration: CATLETT'S STATION]

At Manassas Junction, as it appeared in the upper picture on August 26,
1862, is one of the great neglected strategic points in the theater of the
war.Twenty-five miles from Alexandria and thirty miles in a direct line
from Washington, it was almost within long cannon-shot from any point in
both the luckless battles of Bull Run.It was on the railway route
connecting with Richmond, and at the junction of the railway running
across the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond the Blue Ridge,
through Manassas Gap.The Confederates knew its value, and after the first
battle of Bull Run built the fortifications which we see in the upper
picture, to the left beyond the supply-cars on the railroad.Pope, after
the battle of Cedar Mountain, should have covered it, extending his lines
so as to protect it from Jackson's incursion through Thoroughfare Gap;
instead he held the main force of his army opposing that of Lee.[Illustration: WHERE THE THUNDERBOLT FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The havoc wrought by the Confederate attack of August 26th on the Federal
supply depot at Manassas Junction is here graphically preserved.When
Jackson arrived at sunset of that day at Bristoe's Station, on the Orange
& Alexandria Railroad, he knew that his daring movement would be reported
to Pope's forces by the trains that escaped both north and south.To save
themselves, the troops that had already marched twenty-five miles had to
make still further exertions.Trimble volunteered to move on Manassas
Junction; and, under command of Stuart, a small force moved northward
through the woods.At midnight it arrived within half a mile of the
Junction.The Federal force greeted it with artillery fire, but when the
Confederates charged at the sound of the bugle the gunners abandoned the
batteries to the assaulters.Some three hundred of the small Federal
garrison were captured, with the immense stores that filled the warehouses
to overflowing.The next morning Hill's and Taliaferro's divisions arrived
to hold the position.The half-starved troops were now in possession of
all that was needed to make them an effective force.Jackson was now in
position to control the movements of the Federal army under Pope.[Illustration: GUARDING THE "O.NEAR UNION MILLS

and the single-track railroad was inadequate.[Illustration: DEBRIS FROM JACKSON'S RAID ON THE ORANGE AND ALEXANDRIA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This is part of the result of General Pope's too rapid advance to head off
Lee's army south of the Rappahannock River.Although overtaking the
advance of the Confederates at Cedar Mountain, Pope had arrived too late
to close the river passes against them.Meanwhile he had left the Orange &
Alexandria Railroad uncovered, and Jackson pushed a large force under
General Ewell forward across the Bull Run Mountains.On the night of
August 26, 1863, Ewell's forces captured Manassas Junction, while four
miles above the Confederate cavalry fell upon an empty railroad train
returning from the transfer of Federal troops.Here we see how well the work was done.THE TRAIN "STONEWALL" JACKSON AND STUART STOPPED AT BRISTOE

[Illustration]

By a move of unparalleled boldness, "Stonewall" Jackson, with twenty
thousand men, captured the immense Union supplies at Manassas Junction,
August 26, 1862.Washington lay one day's
march to the north; Warrenton, Pope's headquarters, but twelve miles
distant to the southwest; and along the Rappahannock, between "Stonewall"
Jackson and Lee, stood the tents of another host which outnumbered the
whole Confederate army."Stonewall" Jackson had seized Bristoe Station in
order to break down the railway bridge over Broad Run, and to proceed at
his leisure with the destruction of the stores.A train returning empty
from Warrenton Junction to Alexandria darted through the station under
heavy fire.Two trains which followed in
the same direction as the first went crashing down a high embankment.The
report received at Alexandria from the train which escaped ran as follows:
"No.6 train, engine Secretary, was fired into at Bristoe by a party of
cavalry some five hundred strong.They had piled ties on the track, but
the engine threw them off.It
was a full day before the Federals realized that "Stonewall" Jackson was
really there with a large force.Here, in abundance, was all that had been
absent for some time; besides commissary stores of all sorts, there were
two trains loaded with new clothing, to say nothing of sutler's stores,
replete with "extras" not enumerated in the regulations, and also the camp
of a cavalry regiment which had vacated in favor of Jackson's men.It was
an interesting sight to see the hungry, travel-worn men attacking this
profusion and rewarding themselves for all their fatigues and deprivations
of the preceding few days, and their enjoyment of it and of the day's rest
allowed them.There was a great deal of difficulty for a time in finding
what each man needed most, but this was overcome through a crude barter of
belongings as the day wore on.[Illustration]


[Illustration: A START TOO LONG DELAYED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Where the troops of General McClellan, waiting near the round-house at
Alexandria, were hurried forward to the scene of action where Pope was
struggling with Jackson and Ewell.Pope had counted upon the assistance of
these reenforcements in making the forward movement by which he expected
to hold Lee back.The old bogey of leaving the National Capital
defenseless set up a vacillation in General Halleck's mind and the troops
were held overlong at Alexandria.Had they been promptly forwarded,
"Stonewall" Jackson's blow at Manassas Junction could not have been
struck.At the news of that disaster the troops were hurriedly despatched
down the railroad toward Manassas.But Pope was already in retreat in
three columns toward that point, McDowell had failed to intercept the
Confederate reenforcements coming through Thoroughfare Gap, and the
situation had become critical.General Taylor, with his brigade of New
Jersey troops, was the first of McClellan's forces to be moved forward to
the aid of Pope.At Union Mills, Colonel Scammon, commanding the First
Brigade, driven back from Manassas Junction, was further pressed by the
Confederates on the morning of August 27th.Later in the day General
Taylor's brigade arrived by the Fairfax road and, crossing the railroad
bridge, met the Confederates drawn up and waiting near Manassas Station.A
severe artillery fire greeted the Federals as they emerged from the woods.As General Taylor had no artillery, he was obliged either to retire or
charge.When the Confederate cavalry threatened to
surround his small force, however, Taylor fell back in good order across
the bridge, where two Ohio regiments assisted in holding the Confederates
in check.At this point, General Taylor, who had been wounded in the
retreat, was borne past in a litter.Though suffering much, he appealed to
the officers to prevent another Bull Run.The brigade retired in good
order to Fairfax Court House, where General Taylor died of his wounds a
short time afterward.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE W. TAYLOR]


[Illustration: AN UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY]

Here might have been won a Federal victory that would have precluded
defeat at Second Bull Run.The corps of General Heintzelman, consisting of
the divisions of Hooker and Kearny, was the next detachment of McClellan's
forces to arrive to the aid of Pope.On the 28th of August, Heintzelman
had pushed forward to Centreville, entering it soon after "Stonewall"
Jackson's rear-guard had retired.Instead of pursuing, Heintzelman drew up
his forces east of Cub Run, which we see in the picture.Jackson's forces,
now in a precarious position, fell back toward Thoroughfare Gap to form a
junction with Longstreet's Corps, which Lee had sent forward.The battle
was commenced on the west somewhat feebly by Generals McDowell and Sigel.By nightfall the Confederate left had been driven back fully a mile.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SAMUEL P. HEINTZELMAN AND STAFF

Sleeping on their arms on the night of August 29th, the Federal veterans
were as confident of having won a victory as were the raw troops in the
beginning of the first battle of Bull Run.But the next day's fighting was
to tell the tale.General Ewell had been wounded in the knee by a minie
ball in the severe fight at Groveton and was unable to lead his command;
but for the impetuosity of this commander was substituted that of
Longstreet, nicknamed "the War-Horse," whose arrival in the midst of the
previous day's engagement had cost the Federals dear.On the morning of
the second day Longstreet's batteries opened the engagement.When the
general advance came, as the sun shone on the parallel lines of glittering
bayonets, it was Longstreet's men bringing their muskets to "the ready"
who first opened fire with a long flash of flame.It was they who pressed
most eagerly forward and, in the face of the Federal batteries, fell upon
the troops of General McDowell at the left and drove them irresistibly
back.Although the right Federal wing, in command of General Heintzelman,
had not given an inch, it was this turning of the left by Longstreet which
put the whole Federal army in retreat, driving them across Bull Run.The
Confederates were left in possession of the field, where lay thousands of
Federal dead and wounded, and Lee was free to advance his victorious
troops into the North unmolested.[Illustration: THE BATTLE-FIELD OF SECOND BULL RUN (MANASSAS), AUGUST

"Make Buell, Grant, and Pope major-generals of volunteers and give me

ANTIETAM, OR SHARPSBURG

    At Sharpsburg (Antietam) was sprung the keystone of the arch upon
    which the Confederate cause rested.--_James Longstreet,
    Lieutenant-General C. S. A., in "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
    War."_


A battle remarkable in its actualities but more wonderful in its
possibilities was that of Antietam, with the preceding capture of Harper's
Ferry and the other interesting events that marked the invasion of
Maryland by General Lee.It was one of the bloodiest and the most
picturesque conflicts of the Civil War, and while it was not all that the
North was demanding and not all that many military critics think it might
have been, it enabled President Lincoln to feel that he could with some
assurance issue, as he did, his Emancipation Proclamation.Lee's army, fifty thousand strong, had crossed the Potomac at Leesburg and
had concentrated around Frederick, the scene of the Barbara Frietchie
legend, only forty miles from Washington.When it became known that Lee,
elated by his victory at Second Bull Run, had taken the daring step of
advancing into Maryland, and now threatened the capital of the Republic,
McClellan, commanding the Army of the Potomac, pushed his forces forward
to encounter the invaders.Harper's Ferry, at the junction of the Potomac
and the Shenandoah rivers, was a valuable defense against invasion through
the Valley of Virginia, but once the Confederates had crossed it, a
veritable trap.General Halleck ordered it held and General Lee sent
"Stonewall" Jackson to take it, by attacking the fortress on the Virginia
side.Jackson began his march on September 10th with secret instructions from
his commander to encompass and capture the Federal garrison and the vast
store of war material at this place, made famous a few years before by old
John Brown.To conceal his purpose from the inhabitants he inquired along
the route about the roads leading into Pennsylvania.It was from his march
through Frederick that the Barbara Frietchie story took its rise.But
there is every reason to believe that General Jackson never saw the good
old lady, that the story is a myth, and that Mr.Whittier, who has given
us the popular poem under the title of her name, was misinformed.However,
Colonel H. K. Douglas, who was a member of Jackson's staff, relates, in
"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War," an interesting incident where his
commander on entering Middletown was greeted by two young girls waving a
Union flag.The general bowed to the young women, raised his hat, and
remarked to some of his officers, "We evidently have no friends in this
town."Colonel Douglas concludes, "This is about the way he would have
treated Barbara Frietchie."On the day after Jackson left Frederick he crossed the Potomac by means of
a ford near Williamsport and on the 13th he reached Bolivar Heights.Harper's Ferry lies in a deep basin formed by Maryland Heights on the
north bank of the Potomac, Loudon Heights on the south bank, and Bolivar
Heights on the west.The Shenandoah River breaks through the pass between
Loudon and Bolivar Heights and the village lies between the two at the
apex formed by the junction of the two rivers.As Jackson approached the place by way of Bolivar Heights, Walker occupied
Loudon Heights and McLaws invested Maryland Heights.All were unopposed
except McLaws, who encountered Colonel Ford with a force to dispute his
ascent.Ford, however, after some resistance, spiked his guns and retired
to the Ferry, where Colonel Miles had remained with the greater portion of
the Federal troops.Had Miles led his entire force to Maryland Heights he
could no doubt have held his ground until McClellan came to his relief.But General Halleck had ordered him to hold Harper's Ferry to the last,
and Miles interpreted this order to mean that he must hold the town
itself.He therefore failed to occupy the heights around it in sufficient
strength and thus permitted himself to be caught in a trap.During the day of the 14th the Confederate artillery was dragged up the
mountain sides, and in the afternoon a heavy fire was opened on the doomed
Federal garrison.On that day McClellan received word from Miles that the
latter could hold out for two days longer and the commanding general sent
word: "Hold out to the last extremity.If it is possible, reoccupy the
Maryland Heights with your entire force.If you can do that I will
certainly be able to relieve you.... Hold out to the last."McClellan was
approaching slowly and felt confident he could relieve the place.On the morning of the 15th the roar of Confederate artillery again
resounded from hill to hill.From Loudon to Maryland Heights the firing
had begun and a little later the battle-flags of A. P. Hill rose on
Bolivar Heights.Scarcely two hours had the firing continued when Colonel
Miles raised the white flag at Harper's Ferry and its garrison of 12,500,
with vast military stores, passed into the hands of the Confederates.Colonel Miles was struck by a stray fragment of a Confederate shell which
gave him a mortal wound.The force of General Franklin, preparing to move
to the garrison's relief, on the morning of the 15th noted that firing at
the Ferry had ceased and suspected that the garrison had surrendered, as
it had.The Confederate Colonel Douglas, whose account of the surrender is both
absorbing and authoritative, thus describes the surrender in "Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War":

"Under instructions from General Jackson, I rode up the pike and into the
enemy's lines to ascertain the purpose of the white flag.Near the top of
the hill I met General White and staff and told him my mission.He replied
that Colonel Miles had been mortally wounded, that he was in command and
desired to have an interview with General Jackson.... I conducted them to
General Jackson, whom I found sitting on his horse where I had left
him.... The contrast in appearances there presented was striking.General
White, riding a handsome black horse, was carefully dressed and had on
untarnished gloves, boots, and sword.His staff were equally comely in
costume.On the other hand, General Jackson was the dingiest,
worst-dressed and worst-mounted general that a warrior who cared for good
looks and style would wish to surrender to."General Jackson... rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry.The
curiosity in the Union army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road.... One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: 'Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.'"McClellan had failed to reach Harper's Ferry in time to relieve it because
he was detained at South Mountain by a considerable portion of Lee's army
under D. H. Hill and Longstreet.McClellan had come into possession of
Lee's general order, outlining the campaign.Discovering by this order
that Lee had sent Jackson to attack Harper's Ferry he made every effort to
relieve it.The affair at Harper's Ferry, as that at South Mountain, was but a prelude
to the tremendous battle that was to follow two days later on the banks of
the little stream called Antietam Creek, in Maryland.When it was known
that Lee had led his army across the Potomac the people were filled with
consternation--the people, not only of the immediate vicinity, but of
Harrisburg, of Baltimore, of Philadelphia.Their fear was intensified by
the memory of the Second Bull Run of a few weeks earlier, and by the fact
that at this very time General Bragg was marching northward across
Kentucky with a great army, menacing Louisville and Cincinnati.As one year before, the hopes of the North had centered in George B.
McClellan, so it was now with the people of the East.They were ready to
forget his failure to capture Richmond in the early summer and to contrast
his partial successes on the Peninsula with the drastic defeat of his
successor at the Second Bull Run.When McClellan, therefore, passed through Maryland to the scene of the
coming battle, many of the people received him with joy and enthusiasm.At
Frederick City, he tells us in his "Own Story," he was "nearly overwhelmed
and pulled to pieces," and the people invited him into their houses and
gave him every demonstration of confidence.The first encounter, a double one, took place on September 14th, at two
passes of South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge, north of the
Potomac.General Franklin, who had been sent to relieve Harper's Ferry,
met a Confederate force at Crampton's Gap and defeated it in a sharp
battle of three hours' duration.Meanwhile, the First and Ninth Army
Corps, under Burnside, encountered a stronger force at Turner's Gap seven
miles farther up.The battle here continued many hours, till late in the
night, and the Union troops were victorious.Lee's loss was nearly twenty-seven hundred, of whom eight hundred were
prisoners.The Federals lost twenty-one hundred men and they failed to
save Harper's Ferry.Lee now placed Longstreet and D. H. Hill in a strong position near
Keedysville, but learning that McClellan was advancing rapidly, the
Confederate leader decided to retire to Sharpsburg, where he could be more
easily joined by Jackson.September 16th was a day of intense anxiety and
unrest in the valley of the Antietam.The people who had lived in the
farmhouses that dotted the golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community had now abandoned their homes and given place to the armed
forces.It was a day of marshaling and maneuvering of the gathering
thousands, preparatory to the mighty conflict that was clearly seen to be
inevitable.Lee had taken a strong position on the west bank of Antietam
Creek a few miles from where it flows into the Potomac.He made a display
of force, exposing his men to the fire of the Federal artillery, his
object being to await the coming of Jackson's command from Harper's Ferry.It is true that Jackson himself had arrived, but his men were weary with
marching and, moreover, a large portion of his troops under A. P. Hill and
McLaws had not yet reached the field.McClellan spent the day arranging his corps and giving directions for
planting batteries.With a few companions he rode along the whole front,
frequently drawing the fire of the Confederate batteries and thus
revealing their location.The right wing of his army, the corps of
Generals Hooker, Mansfield, and Sumner, lay to the north, near the village
of Keedysville.General Porter with two divisions of the Fifth Corps
occupied the center and Burnside was on the left of the Union lines.Back
of McClellan's lines was a ridge on which was a signal station commanding
a view of the entire field.Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Hooker
crossing the Antietam, advanced against Hood's division on the Confederate
left.For several hours there was heavy skirmishing, which closed with the
coming of darkness.The two great armies now lay facing each other in a grand double line
three miles in length.At one point (the Union right and the Confederate
left) they were so near together that the pickets could hear each other's
tread.It required no prophet to foretell what would happen on the morrow.Beautiful and clear the morning broke over the Maryland hills on the
fateful 17th of September, 1862.The sunlight had not yet crowned the
hilltops when artillery fire announced the opening of the battle.Hooker's
infantry soon entered into the action and encountered the Confederates in
an open field, from which the latter were presently pressed back across
the Hagerstown pike to a line of woods where they made a determined stand.Hooker then called on General Mansfield to come to his aid, and the latter
quickly did so, for he had led his corps across the Antietam after dark
the night before.Mansfield, however, a gallant and honored veteran, fell
mortally wounded while deploying his troops, and General Alpheus S.
Williams, at the head of his first division, succeeded to the command.There was a wood west of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike which,
with its outcropping ledges of rock, formed an excellent retreat for the
Confederates and from this they pushed their columns into the open fields,
chiefly of corn, to meet the Union attacks.For about two hours the battle
raged at this point, the lines swaying to and fro, with fearful slaughter
on both sides.At length, General Greene, who commanded a division of the
fallen Mansfield's corps, gained possession of part of the coveted forest,
near a little white church, known as the Dunker's Chapel.This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left wing.But Greene's troops
were exposed to a galling fire from D. H. Hill's division and he called
for reenforcements.General Sumner then sent Sedgwick's division across the stream and
accompanied the troops to the aid of their hard-pressed comrades.And the
experience of this body of the gallant Second Corps during the next hour
was probably the most thrilling episode of the whole day's battle.Sedgwick's troops advanced straight toward the conflict.They found Hooker
wounded and his and Williams' troops quite exhausted.A sharp artillery
fire was turned on Sedgwick before he reached the woods west of the
Hagerstown pike, but once in the shelter of the thick trees he passed in
safety to the western edge.Heavy Confederate reenforcements--ten brigades, in fact--Walker's men, and
McLaws', having arrived from Harper's Ferry--were hastening up, and they
not only blocked the front, but worked around to the rear of Sedgwick's
isolated brigades.Sedgwick was wounded in the awful slaughter that
followed, but he and Sumner finally extricated their men with a loss of
two thousand, over three hundred left dead on the ghastly field.Franklin
now sent forward some fresh troops and after obstinately fighting, the
Federals finally held a cornfield and most of the coveted wood over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was saturated with blood.Before the close of this bloody conflict on the Union right another,
almost if not quite as deadly, was in progress near the center.General
French, soon joined by General Richardson, both of Sumner's corps, crossed
the stream and made a desperate assault against the Southerners of D. H.
Hill's division, stationed to the south of where the battle had previously
raged--French on a line of heights strongly held by the Confederates,
Richardson in the direction of a sunken road, since known as "Bloody
Lane."The fighting here was of a most desperate character and continued
nearly four hours.French captured a few flags, several hundred prisoners,
and gained some ground, but he failed to carry the heights.Richardson was
mortally wounded while leading a charge and was succeeded by General
Hancock; but his men finally captured Bloody Lane with the three hundred
living men who had remained to defend it.The final Federal charge at this
point was made by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost bravery and
self-possession in the thickest of the fight, where he won a
brigadier-generalship.He was wounded, and later carried off the field.The Confederates had fought desperately to hold their position in Bloody
Lane, and when it was captured it was filled with dead bodies.It was now
about one o'clock and the infantry firing ceased for the day on the Union
right, and center.Let us now look on the other part of the field.Burnside held the Federal
left wing against Lee's right, and he remained inactive for some hours
after the battle had begun at the other end of the line.In front of
Burnside was a triple-arched stone bridge across the Antietam, since known
as "Burnside's Bridge."Opposite this bridge, on the <DW72> which extends
to a high ridge, were Confederate breastworks and rifle-pits, which
commanded the bridge with a direct or enfilading fire.While the Federal
right was fighting on the morning of the 17th, McClellan sent an order to
Burnside to advance on the bridge, to take possession of it and cross the
stream by means of it.It must have been about ten o'clock when Burnside
received the order as McClellan was more than two miles away.Burnside's chief officer at this moment was General Jacob D. Cox
(afterward Governor of Ohio), who had succeeded General Reno, killed at
South Mountain.On Cox fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.The
defense of the bridge was in the hands of General Robert Toombs, a former
United States senator and a member of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet.Perhaps
the most notable single event in the life of General Toombs was his
holding of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours against the
assaults of the Federal troops.The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support of Jackson, where, as we
have noticed, he took part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's division.Toombs, therefore, with his one brigade had a heavy task before him in
defending the bridge with his small force, notwithstanding his advantage
of position.McClellan sent several urgent orders to advance at all hazards.Burnside
forwarded these to Cox, and in the fear that the latter would be unable to
carry the bridge by a direct front attack, he sent Rodman with a division
to cross the creek by a ford some distance below.Meanwhile, in rapid succession, one assault after
another was made upon the bridge and, about one o'clock, it was carried,
at the cost of five hundred men.A lull in the
fighting along the whole line of battle now ensued.Burnside, however, received another order from McClellan to push on up the
heights and to the village of Sharpsburg.The great importance of this
move, if successful, was that it would cut Lee out from his line of
retreat by way of Shepherdstown.After replenishing the ammunition and adding some fresh troops, Cox
advanced at three o'clock with the utmost gallantry toward Sharpsburg.The
Confederates disputed the ground with great bravery.But Cox swept all
before him and was at the edge of the village when he was suddenly
confronted by lines in blue uniforms who instantly opened fire.The
Federals were astonished to see the blue-clad battalions before them.They
must be Union soldiers; but how did they get there?They were A. P. Hill's division of Lee's army which had just
arrived from Harper's Ferry, and they had dressed themselves in the
uniforms that they had taken from the Federal stores.Hill had come just in time to save Lee's headquarters from capture.He
checked Cox's advance, threw a portion of the troops into great confusion,
and steadily pressed them back toward the Antietam.In this, the end of
the battle, General Rodman fell mortally wounded.Cox retired in good
order and Sharpsburg remained in the hands of the Confederates.Thus, with the approach of nightfall, closed the memorable battle of
Antietam.For fourteen long hours more than one hundred thousand men, with
five hundred pieces of artillery, had engaged in titanic combat.As the
pall of battle smoke rose and cleared away, the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder.There lay upon the ground, scattered for
three miles over the valleys and the hills or in the improvised hospitals,
more than twenty thousand men.Horace Greeley was probably right in
pronouncing this the bloodiest day in American history.Although tactically it was a drawn battle, Antietam was decisively in
favor of the North inasmuch as it ended the first Confederate attempt at a
Northern invasion.General Lee realized that his ulterior plans had been
thwarted by this engagement and after a consultation with his corps
commanders he determined to withdraw from Maryland.On the night of the
18th the retreat began and early the next morning the Confederate army had
all safely recrossed the Potomac.The great mistake of the Maryland campaign from the standpoint of the
Confederate forces, thought General Longstreet, was the division of Lee's
army, and he believed that if Lee had kept his forces together he would
not have been forced to abandon the campaign.At Antietam, he had less
than forty thousand men, who were in poor condition for battle while
McClellan had about eighty-seven thousand, most of whom were fresh and
strong, though not more than sixty thousand were in action.The moral effect of the battle of Antietam was incalculably great.It
aroused the confidence of the Northern people.It emboldened President
Lincoln to issue five days after its close the proclamation freeing the
slaves in the seceded states.He had written the proclamation long before,
but it had lain inactive in his desk at Washington.All through the
struggles of the summer of 1862 he had looked forward to the time when he
could announce his decision to the people.With the doubtful success of Federal arms, to make such a bold step would
have been a mockery and would have defeated the very end he sought.The South had now struck its first desperate blow at the gateways to the
North.By daring, almost unparalleled in warfare, it had swung its
courageous army into a strategical position where with the stroke of
fortune it might have hammered down the defenses of the National capital
on the south and then sweep on a march of invasion into the North.The
Northern soldiers had parried the blow.They had saved themselves from
disaster and had held back the tide of the Confederacy as it beat against
the Mason and Dixon line, forcing it back into the State of Virginia where
the two mighty fighting bodies were soon to meet again in a desperate
struggle for the right-of-way at Fredericksburg.[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS

ACCORDING TO HIS WIDOW THE ONLY WAR-TIME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE CONFEDERACY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Thus appeared Jefferson Davis, who on the eve of Antietam was facing one
of the gravest crises of his career.Eighteen months previously, on
February 9, 1861, he had been unanimously elected president of the
Confederate States of America.He maintained
that the secession of the Southern states should be regarded as a purely
peaceful move.But events had swiftly drawn him and his government into
the most stupendous civil conflict of modern times.Now, in September,
1862, he was awaiting the decision of fate.The Southern forces had
advanced northward triumphantly.Elated by success, they were at this
moment invading the territory of the enemy under the leadership of Lee,
whose victories had everywhere inspired not only confidence but enthusiasm
and devotion.Should he overthrow the Northern armies, the Confederacy
would be recognized abroad and its independence probably established at
home.Should he be defeated, no one could foretell the result.From this time the fortunes of the Confederacy waned.[Illustration: LEE LOCKS THE GATES

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Sharpsburg, Maryland, September 17, 1862.There were long minutes on that
sunny day in the early fall of 1862 when Robert E. Lee, at his
headquarters west of Sharpsburg, must have been in almost entire ignorance
of how the battle went.Outnumbered he knew his troops were; outfought he
knew they never would be.Longstreet, Hood, D. H. Hill, Evans, and D. R.
Jones had turned back more than one charge in the morning; but, as the day
wore on, Lee perceived that the center must be held.He had deceived McClellan as to his numerical strength and he must
continue to do so.At one time
General Longstreet reported from the center to General Chilton, Lee's
Chief of Staff, that Cooke's North Carolina regiment--still keeping its
colors at the front--had not a cartridge left.None but veteran troops
could hold a line like this, supported by only two guns of Miller's
battery of the Washington Artillery.Of this crisis in the battle General
Longstreet wrote afterward: "We were already badly whipped and were
holding our ground by sheer force of desperation."Actually in line that
day on the Confederate side were only 37,000 men, and opposed to them were
numbers that could be footed up to 50,000 more.At what time in the day
General Lee must have perceived that the invasion of Maryland must come to
an end cannot be told.He had lost 20,000 of his tired, footsore army by
straggling on the march, according to the report of Longstreet, who adds:
"Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or
wounded."At dark Lee's rearward movement had begun.[Illustration: A REGIMENT THAT FOUGHT AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN--THE THIRTY-FIFTH

A HERO OF SEDGWICK'S CHARGE]

Early in the morning of September 17, 1862, Knap's battery (shown below)
got into the thick of the action of Antietam.General Mansfield had posted
it opposite the north end of the West Woods, close to the Confederate
line.The guns opened fire at seven o'clock.Practically unsupported, the
battery was twice charged upon during the morning; but quickly
substituting canister for shot and shell, the men held their ground and
stemmed the Confederate advance.Near this spot General Mansfield was
mortally wounded while deploying his troops.About noon a section of
Knap's battery was detached to the assistance of General Greene, in the
East Woods.[Illustration: KNAP'S BATTERY, JUST AFTER THE BLOODY WORK AT ANTIETAM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This photograph was taken back of the rail fence on the Hagerstown pike,
where "Stonewall" Jackson's men attempted to rally in the face of Hooker's
ferocious charge that opened the bloodiest day of the Civil War--September
17, 1862.Hooker, advancing to seize high ground nearly three-quarters of
a mile distant, had not gone far before the glint of the rising sun
disclosed the bayonet-points of a large Confederate force standing in a
cornfield in his immediate front.This was a part of Jackson's Corps which
had arrived during the morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry and had been posted in this position to surprise Hooker in his
advance.The outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.All of
Hooker's batteries hurried into action and opened with canister on the
cornfield.The Confederates stood bravely up against this fire, and as
Hooker's men advanced they made a determined resistance.Back and still
farther back were Jackson's men driven across the open field, every stalk
of corn in which was cut down by the battle as closely as a knife could
have done it.On the ground the slain lay in rows precisely as they had
stood in ranks.From the cornfield into a small patch of woods (the West
Woods) the Confederates were driven, leaving the sad result of the
surprise behind them.As the edge of the woods was approached by Hooker's
men the resistance became stronger and more stubborn.Nearly all the units
of two of Jackson's divisions were now in action, and cavalry and
artillery were aiding them."The two lines," says General Palfrey, "almost
tore each other to pieces."General Starke and Colonel Douglas on the
Confederate side were killed.More than half of Lawton's and Hays'
brigades were either killed or wounded.On the Federal side General
Ricketts lost a third of his division.The energy of both forces was
entirely spent and reinforcements were necessary before the battle could
be continued.Many of Jackson's men wore trousers and caps of Federal
blue, as did most of the troops which had been engaged with Jackson in the
affair at Harper's Ferry.A. P. Hill's men, arriving from Harper's Ferry
that same afternoon, were dressed in new Federal uniforms--a part of their
booty--and at first were mistaken for Federals by the friends who were
anxiously awaiting them.[Illustration: THE THRICE-FOUGHT GROUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The field beyond the leveled fence is covered with both Federal and
Confederate dead.Over this open space swept Sedgwick's division of
Sumner's Second Corps, after passing through the East and entering the
West Woods.This is near where the Confederate General Ewell's division,
reenforced by McLaws and Walker, fell upon Sedgwick's left flank and rear.Nearly two thousand Federal soldiers were struck down, the division losing
during the day more than forty per cent.One
regiment lost sixty per cent.--the highest regimental loss sustained.Later the right of the Confederate line crossed the turnpike at the Dunker
church (about half a mile to the left of the picture) and made two
assaults upon Greene, but they were repulsed with great slaughter.General
D. R. Jones, of Jackson's division, had been wounded.The brave Starke who
succeeded him was killed; and Lawton, who followed Starke, had fallen
wounded.[Illustration: RUIN OF MUMMA'S HOUSE, ANTIETAM]

A flaming mansion was the guidon for the extreme left of Greene's division
when (early in the morning) he had moved forward along the ridge leading
to the East Woods.This dwelling belonged to a planter by the name of
Mumma.It stood in the very center of the Federal advance, and also at the
extreme left of D. H. Hill's line.The house had been fired by the
Confederates, who feared that its thick walls might become a vantage-point
for the Federal infantry.It burned throughout the battle, the flames
subsiding only in the afternoon.Before it, just across the road, a
battery of the First Rhode Island Light Artillery had placed its guns.Twice were they charged, but each time they were repulsed.From Mumma's
house it was less than half a mile across the open field to the Dunker
church.The fence-rails in the upper picture were those of the field
enclosing Mumma's land, and the heroic dead pictured lying there were in
full sight from the burning mansion.[Illustration: THE HARVEST OF "BLOODY LANE"

blow of which the Federals could boast in the day's fighting at Antietam,
September 17, 1862.In the lower picture we see the officers whose work
first began to turn the tide of battle into a decisive advantage which the
Army of the Potomac had every reason to expect would be gained by its
superior numbers.On the Federal right Jackson, with a bare four thousand
men, had taken the fight out of Hooker's eighteen thousand in the morning,
giving ground at last to Sumner's fresh troops.On the Federal left,
Burnside (at the lower bridge) failed to advance against Longstreet's
Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached for service elsewhere.It was
at the center that the forces of French and Richardson, skilfully fought
by their leaders, broke through the Confederate lines and, sweeping beyond
the sunken road, seized the very citadel of the center.Meagher's Irish
Brigade had fought its way to a crest from which a plunging fire could be
poured upon the Confederates in the sunken road.Meagher's ammunition was
exhausted, and Caldwell threw his force into the position and continued
the terrible combat.When the Confederates executed their flanking
movement to the left, Colonel D. R. Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire,
seized a position which exposed Hill's men to an enfilading fire.(In the

[Illustration: SHERRICK'S HOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In three distinct localities the battle waxed fierce from dawn to dusk on
that terrible day at Antietam, September 17, 1862.First at the Federal
right around the Dunker church; then at the sunken road, where the centers
of both armies spent themselves in sanguinary struggle; lastly, late in
the day, the struggle was renewed and ceased on the Sharpsburg road.When
Burnside finally got his troops in motion, Sturgis' division of the Ninth
Corps was first to cross the creek; his men advanced through an open
ravine under a withering fire till they gained the opposite crest and held
it until reenforced by Wilcox.To their right ran the Sharpsburg road, and
an advance was begun in the direction of the Sherrick house.[Illustration: GENERAL A. P. HILL, C. S.The fighting along the Sharpsburg road might have resulted in a
Confederate disaster had it not been for the timely arrival of the troops
of General A. P. Hill.His six brigades of Confederate veterans had been
the last to leave Harper's Ferry, remaining behind Jackson's main body in
order to attend to the details of the surrender.Just as the Federal Ninth
Corps was in the height of its advance, a cloud of dust on Harper's Ferry
road cheered the Confederates to redoubled effort.Out of the dust the
brigades of Hill debouched upon the field.Their fighting blood seemed to
have but mounted more strongly during their march of eighteen miles.Without waiting for orders, Hill threw his men into the fight and the
progress of the Ninth Corps was stopped.Lee had counted on the arrival of
Hill in time to prevent any successful attempt upon the Confederate right
held by Longstreet's Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached in the
thick of the fighting of the morning, when Lee's left and center suffered
so severely.Burnside's delay at the bridge could not have been more
fortunate for Lee if he had fixed its duration himself.Had the
Confederate left been attacked at the time appointed, the outcome of
Antietam could scarcely have been other than a decisive victory for the
Federals.Even at the time when Burnside's tardy advance began, it must
have prevailed against the weakened and wearied Confederates had not the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill averted the disaster.[Illustration: AFTER THE ADVANCE]

In the advance along the Sharpsburg road near the Sherrick house the 79th
New York "Highlanders" deployed as skirmishers.From orchards and
cornfields and from behind fences and haystacks the Confederate
sharpshooters opened upon them, but they swept on, driving in a part of
Jones' division and capturing a battery just before A. P. Hill's troops
arrived.With these reenforcements the Confederates drove back the brave
Highlanders from the suburbs of Sharpsburg, which they had reached.Stubborn Scotch blood would permit only a reluctant retreat.Sharp
fighting occurred around the Sherrick house with results seen in the lower
picture.[Illustration: THE SEVENTEENTH NEW YORK ARTILLERY DRILLING BEFORE THE

    As it is, the battle of Stone's River seems less clearly a Federal
    victory than the battle of Shiloh.The latter decided the fall of
    Corinth; the former did not decide the fall of Chattanooga.Offensively it was a drawn battle, as looked at from either side.As a
    defensive battle, however, it was clearly a Union victory.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The battle of Corinth developed a man--William S. Rosecrans--whose
singular skill in planning the battle, and whose dauntless courage in
riding between the firing-lines at the opportune moment, drew the
country's attention almost as fully as Grant had done at Fort Donelson.And at this particular moment the West needed, or thought it needed, a
man.The autumn months of 1862 had been spent by Generals Bragg and Buell
in an exciting race across Kentucky, each at the head of a great army.Buell had saved Louisville from the legions of Bragg, and he had driven
the Confederate Army of the Mississippi from the State; but he had not
prevented his opponent from carrying away a vast amount of plunder, nor
had he won decisive results at the battle of Perryville, which took place
October 8, 1862, four days after the battle of Corinth.Thereupon the
Federal authorities decided to relieve Buell of the Army of the Ohio and
to give it to General Rosecrans.On October 30, 1862, Rosecrans assumed command at Nashville of this force,
which was now designated as the Army of the Cumberland.Bragg had
concentrated his army at Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, about thirty
miles southeast of Nashville and a mile east of a little tributary of the
Cumberland River called Stone's River.Here occurred, two months later,
the bloodiest single day's battle in the West, a conflict imminent as
soon as the news came (on December 26th) that the Federals were advancing
from Nashville.General Bragg did not lose a moment in marshaling his army into well-drawn
battle-lines.His army was in two corps with a cavalry division under
General Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan being on detached service.The left
wing, under General Hardee, and the center, under Polk, were sent across
Stone's River, the right wing, a division under John C. Breckinridge,
remaining on the eastern side of the stream to guard the town.The line
was three miles in length, and on December 30th the Federal host that had
come from Nashville stood opposite, in a parallel line.The left wing, opposite Breckinridge, was commanded by
Thomas L. Crittenden, whose brother was a commander in the Confederacy.They were sons of the famous United States senator from Kentucky, John J.
Crittenden.The Federal center, opposite Polk, was commanded by George H.
Thomas, and the right wing, opposing the Confederate left, was led by
Alexander McD.McCook, one of the well-known "Fighting McCook" brothers.The effective Federal force was about forty-three thousand men; the
Confederate army numbered about thirty-eight thousand.That night they
bivouacked within musket range of each other and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other as they shone through the cedar groves that
interposed.Thus lay the two great armies, ready to spring upon each other
in deadly combat with the coming of the morning.Rosecrans had permitted McCook to thin out his lines over too much space,
while on that very part of the field Bragg had concentrated his forces for
the heaviest attack.The plans of battle made by the two opposing
commanders were strikingly similar.Rosecrans' plan was to throw his left
wing, under Crittenden, across the river upon the Confederate right under
Breckinridge, to crush it in one impetuous dash, and to swing around
through Murfreesboro to the Franklin road and cut off the Confederate
line of retreat.Bragg, on the other hand, intended to make a similar dash
upon the Union right, pivot upon his center, press back McCook upon that
center, crumpling the Federals and seizing the Nashville turnpike to cut
off Rosecrans' retreat toward Nashville.Neither, of course, knew of the
other's plan, and much would depend on who would strike first.At the early light of the last day of the year the Confederate left wing
moved upon the Union right in a magnificent battle-line, three-quarters of
a mile in length and two columns deep.At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon.McCook was astonished at so fierce and
sudden a charge.The gallant Patrick Cleburne, one of the ablest
commanders in the Southern armies, led his division, which had been
brought from the Confederate right, in the charge.The Federal lines were
ill prepared for this sudden onslaught, and before McCook could arrange
them several batteries were overpowered and eleven of the heavy guns were
in the hands of the Confederates.Slowly the Union troops fell back, firing as they went; but they had no
power to check the impetuous, overwhelming charge of the onrushing foe.McCook's two right divisions, under Johnson and Jeff.C. Davis, were
driven back, but his third division, which was commanded by a young
officer who had attracted unusual attention at the battle of
Perryville--Philip H. Sheridan--held its ground.At the first Confederate
advance, Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division drove the troops in front
of it back into their entrenchments, and in the charge the brave Sill lost
his life.While the battle raged with tremendous fury on the Union right, Rosecrans
was three miles away, throwing his left across the river.Hearing the
terrific roar of battle at the other end of the line, Rosecrans hastened
to begin his attack on Breckinridge hoping to draw a portion of the
Confederate force away from McCook.But as the hours of the forenoon
passed he was dismayed as he noted that the sound of battle was coming
nearer, and he rightly divined that his right wing was receding before the
dashing soldiers of the South.He ordered McCook to dispute every inch of
the ground; but McCook's command was soon torn to pieces and disorganized,
except the division of Sheridan.The latter stood firm against the overwhelming numbers, a stand that
attracted the attention of the country and brought him military fame.He
checked the onrushing Confederates at the point of the bayonet; he formed
a new line under fire.In his first position Sheridan held his ground for
two hours.The Confederate attack had also fallen heavily on Negley, who
was stationed on Sheridan's left, and on Palmer, both of Thomas' center.Rousseau commanding the reserves, and Van Cleve of Crittenden's forces
were ordered to the support of the Union center and right.Here, for two
hours longer the battle raged with unabated fury, and the slaughter of
brave men on both sides was appalling.Three times the whole Confederate
left and center were thrown against the Union divisions, but failed to
break the lines.At length when their cartridge boxes were empty
Sheridan's men could do nothing but retire for more ammunition, and they
did this in good order to a rolling plain near the Nashville road.But
Rousseau of Thomas' center was there to check the Confederate advance.It was now past noon, and still the battle roar resounded unceasingly
through the woods and hills about Murfreesboro.Though both hosts had
struggled and suffered since early morning, they still held to their guns,
pouring withering volleys into each other's ranks.The Federal right and
center had been forced back at right angles to the position they had held
when day dawned; and the Confederate left was swung around at right angles
to its position of the morning.The Federal left rested on Stone's River,
while Bragg's right was on the same stream and close to the line in blue.Meantime, Rosecrans had massed his artillery on a little hill overlooking
the field of action.He had also re-formed the broken lines of the right
and center and called in twelve thousand fresh troops.Then, after a brief
lull, the battle opened again and the ranks of both sides were torn with
grape and canister and bursting shells.In answer to Bragg's call for reenforcements came Breckinridge with all
but one brigade of his division, a host of about seven thousand fresh
troops.The new Confederate attack began slowly, but increased its speed
at every step.Suddenly, a thundering volley burst from the line in blue,
and the front ranks of the attacking column disappeared.Again, a volley
tore through the ranks in gray, and the assault was abandoned.The battle had raged for nearly eleven hours, when night enveloped the
scene, and the firing abated slowly and died away.It had been a bloody
day--this first day's fight at Stone's River--and except at Antietam it
had not thus far been surpassed in the war.The advantage was clearly with
the Confederates.They had pressed back the Federals for two miles, had
routed their right wing and captured many prisoners and twenty-eight heavy
guns.But Rosecrans determined to hold his ground and try again.The next day was New Year's and but for a stray fusillade, here and there,
both armies remained inactive, except that each quietly prepared to renew
the contest on the morrow.The renewal of the battle on January 2nd was
fully expected on both sides, but there was little fighting till four in
the afternoon.Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve's division on January
1st across the river to seize an elevation from which he could shell the
town of Murfreesboro.Bragg now sent Breckinridge to dislodge the
division, and he did so with splendid effect.But Breckinridge's men came
into such a position as to be exposed to the raking fire of fifty-two
pieces of Federal artillery on the west side of the river.Returning the
deadly and constant fire as best they could, they stood the storm of shot
and shell for half an hour when they retreated to a place of safety,
leaving seventeen hundred of their number dead or wounded on the field.That night the two armies again lay within musket shot of each other.The
next day brought no further conflict and during that night General Bragg
moved away to winter quarters at Shelbyville, on the Elk River.Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, was one of the great battles of the war.The losses were about thirteen thousand to the Federals and over ten
thousand to the Confederates.Both sides claimed victory--the South
because of Bragg's signal success on the first day; the North because of
Breckinridge's fearful repulse at the final onset and of Bragg's
retreating in the night and refusing to fight again.A portion of the
Confederate army occupied Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the larger part
entrenched at Tullahoma, eighteen miles to the southeast.Six months after the battle of Stone's River, the Federal army suddenly
awoke from its somnolent condition--a winter and spring spent in raids and
unimportant skirmishes--and became very busy preparing for a long and
hasty march.Rosecrans' plan of campaign was brilliant and proved most
effective.He realized that Tullahoma was the barrier to Chattanooga, and
determined to drive the Confederates from it.On June 23, 1863, the advance began.The cavalry, under General Stanley,
had received orders to advance upon Shelbyville on the 24th, and during
that night to build immense and numerous camp-fires before the Confederate
stronghold at Shelbyville, to create the impression that Rosecrans' entire
army was massing at that point.But the wily leader of the Federals had
other plans, and when Stanley, supported by General Granger, had built his
fires, the larger force was closing in upon Tullahoma.The stratagem dawned upon Bragg too late to check Rosecrans' plans.Stanley and Granger made a brilliant capture of Shelbyville, and Bragg
retired to Tullahoma; but finding here that every disposition had been
made to fall upon his rear, he continued his southward retreat toward
Chattanooga.[Illustration: MEN WHO LEARNED WAR WITH SHERMAN

so that they could never be used again.The wrecking of a railroad might
postpone a maneuver for months, or might terminate a campaign suddenly in
defeat.Each side in retreat burned its bridges and destroyed the railroad

repair.[Illustration: SKIRMISHERS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE._Painted by J. W. Gies._

FREDERICKSBURG--DISASTER FOR A NEW UNION LEADER

    The Army of the Potomac had fought gallantly; it had not lost a single
    cannon, all its attacks being made by masses of infantry; it had
    experienced neither disorder nor rout.But the defeat was complete,
    and its effects were felt throughout the entire country as keenly as
    in the ranks of the army.The little confidence that Burnside had been
    able to inspire in his soldiers had vanished, and the respect which
    everybody entertained for the noble character of the unfortunate
    general could not supply its place.--_Comte de Paris, in "History of
    the Civil War in America."_


The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg is a memorial of one
of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.The battle of Antietam had been
regarded a victory by the Federals and a source of hope to the North,
after a wearisome period of inaction and defeats.General George B.
McClellan, in command of the Army of the Potomac, failed to follow up this
advantage and strike fast and hard while the Southern army was shattered
and weak.President Lincoln's impatience was brought to a climax;
McClellan was relieved and succeeded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, who
was looked upon with favor by the President, and who had twice declined
this proffered honor.It was on November 5, 1862, nearly two months after
Antietam, when this order was issued.The Army of the Potomac was in
splendid form and had made plans for a vigorous campaign.On the 9th
Burnside assumed command, and on the following day McClellan took leave of
his beloved troops.Burnside at once changed the whole plan of campaign, and decided to move
on Fredericksburg, which lay between the Union and Confederate armies.He
organized his army into three grand divisions, under Generals Sumner,
Hooker, and Franklin, commanding the right, center, and left, and moved
his troops from Warrenton to Falmouth.A delay of some two weeks was due
to the failure of arrival of the pontoons.In a council of war held on the
night of December 10th the officers under Burnside expressed themselves
almost unanimously as opposed to the plan of battle, but Burnside
disregarded their views and determined to carry out his original plans
immediately.After some delay and desultory fighting for two days, the
crossing of the army was effected by the morning of December 13th.By this
time General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederates, had his army
concentrated and entrenched on the hills surrounding the town.In their
efforts to place their bridges the Federals were seriously hindered by the
firing of the Confederate sharpshooters--"hornets that were stinging the
Army of the Potomac into a frenzy."The Confederate fire continued until
silenced by a heavy bombardment of the city from the Federal guns, when
the crossing of the army into Fredericksburg was completed without further
interference.The forces of Lee were in battle array about the town.Their line
stretched for five miles along the range of hills which spread in crescent
shape around the lowland where the city lay, surrounding it on all sides
save the east, where the river flowed.The strongest Confederate position
was on the <DW72>s of the lowest hill of the range, Marye's Heights, which
rose in the rear of the town.Along the foot of this hill there was a
stone wall, about four feet in height, bounding the eastern side of the
Telegraph road, which at this point runs north and south, being depressed
a few feet below the surface of the stone wall, thus forming a breastwork
for the Confederate troops.Behind it a strong force was concealed, while
higher up, in several ranks, the main army was massed, stretching along
the line of hills.The right wing, consisting of thirty thousand troops on
an elevation near Hamilton's Crossing of the Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, was commanded by "Stonewall" Jackson.The left, on Marye's
Heights and Marye's Hill, was commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet.The
Southern forces numbered about seventy-eight thousand.Into the little city below and the adjoining valleys, the Federal troops
had been marching for two days.Franklin's Left Grand Division of forty
thousand was strengthened by two divisions from Hooker's Center Grand
Division, and was ordered to make the first attack on the Confederate
right under Jackson.Sumner's Right Grand Division, also reenforced from
Hooker's forces, was formed for assault against the Confederate's
strongest point at Marye's Hill.All this magnificent and portentous battle formation had been effected
under cover of a dense fog, and when it lifted on that fateful Saturday
there was revealed a scene of truly military grandeur.Concealed by the
somber curtain of nature the Southern hosts had fixed their batteries and
entrenched themselves most advantageously upon the hills, and the Union
legions, massed in menacing strength below, now lay within easy
cannon-shot of their foe.The Union army totaled one hundred and thirteen
thousand men.After skirmishing and gathering of strength, it was at
length ready for the final spring and the death-grapple.When the sun's rays broke through the fog during the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's Grand Division was revealed in full strength in front of
the Confederate right, marching and countermarching in preparation for the
coming conflict.Officers in new, bright uniforms, thousands of bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling gun-carriages whisking
artillery into proper range of the foe, infantry, cavalry, batteries, with
officers and men, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur which excited the
admiration even of the Confederates.This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war.Yet with all this brave show, we have seen that Burnside's subordinate
officers were unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking.The English military writer,
Colonel Henderson, has explained why this was so:

    And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that moral
    force without which physical power, even in its most terrible form, is
    but an idle show.Not only were the strength of the Confederate
    position, the want of energy of preliminary movements, the insecurity
    of their own situation, but too apparent to the intelligence of the
    regimental officers and men, but they mistrusted their commander.Northern writers have recorded that the Army of the Potomac never went
    down to battle with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.The first advance began at 8:30 in the morning, while the fog was still
dense, upon Jackson's right.Reynolds ordered Meade with a division,
supported by two other divisions under Doubleday and Gibbon, to attack
Jackson at his weakest point, the extreme right of the Confederate lines,
and endeavor to seize one of the opposing heights.The advance was made in
three lines of battle, which were guarded in front and on each flank by
artillery which swept the field in front as the army advanced.The
Confederates were placed to have an enfilading sweep from both flanks
along the entire front line of march.When Reynolds' divisions had
approached within range, Jackson's small arms on the left poured in a
deadly fire, mowing down the brave men in the Union lines in swaths,
leaving broad gaps where men had stood.This fire was repeated again and again, as the Federals pressed on, only
to be repulsed.Once only was the Confederate line broken, when Meade
carried the crest, capturing flags and prisoners.The ground lost by the
Confederates was soon recovered, and the Federals were forced to retire.Some of the charges made by the Federals during this engagement were
heroic in the extreme, only equaled by the opposition met from the foe.In one advance, knapsacks were unslung and bayonets fixed; a brigade
marched across a plowed field, and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring to the rear in confusion from the leaden
storm.The fire became incessant and destructive; many fell, killed or wounded;
the front line slackened its pace, and without orders commenced firing.A
halt seemed imminent, and a halt in the face of the terrific fire to which
the men were exposed meant death; but, urged on by regimental commanders
in person, the charge was renewed, when with a shout they leaped the
ditches, charged across the railroad, and upon the foe, killing many with
the bayonet and capturing several hundred prisoners.But this was only a
temporary gain.In every instance the Federals were shattered and driven
back.Men were lying dead in heaps, the wounded and dying were groaning in
agony.Soldiers were fleeing; officers were galloping to and fro urging
their lines forward, and begging their superior officers for assistance
and reenforcement.A dispatch to Burnside from Franklin, dated 2:45, was as follows: "My left
has been very badly handled; what hope is there of getting reenforcements
across the river?"Another dispatch, dated 3:45, read: "Our troops have
gained no ground in the last half hour."In their retreat the fire was almost as destructive as during the assault.Most of the wounded were brought from the field after this engagement, but
the dead were left where they fell.It was during this engagement that
General George D. Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot which had severed
the sword belt of Captain Gibson, leaving him uninjured.The knapsack of a
soldier who was in a stooping posture was struck by a ball, and a deck of
cards was sent flying twenty feet in the air.Those witnessing the
ludicrous scene called to him, "Oh, deal me a hand!"thus indicating the
spirit of levity among soldiers even amid such surroundings.Another
soldier sitting on the ground suddenly leaped high above the heads of his
comrades as a shell struck the spot, scooping a wheelbarrowful of earth,
but the man was untouched.Entirely independent of the action in which the Left Grand Division under
Franklin was engaged against the right wing of the Confederate line,
Sumner's Right Grand Division was engaged in a terrific assault upon the
works on Marye's Heights, the stronghold of the Confederate forces.Their
position was almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks, wood, and stone
barricades running along the sunken road near the foot of Marye's Hill.The Federals were not aware of the sunken road, nor of the force of
twenty-five hundred under General Cobb concealed behind the stone wall,
this wall not being new work as a part of the entrenchments, but of
earlier construction.When the advance up the road was made they were
harassed by shot and shell and rifle-balls at every step, but the men came
dashing into line undismayed by the terrific fire which poured down upon
them.The Irish Brigade, the second of Hancock's division, under General
Meagher, made a wonderful charge.When they returned from the assault but
two hundred and fifty out of twelve hundred men reported under arms from
the field, and all these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.The One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania regiment was new on the field
of battle, but did fearless and heroic service.The approach was
completely commanded by the Confederate guns.Repeatedly the advance was
repulsed by well-directed fire from the batteries.Once again Sumner's gallant men charged across a railroad cut, running
down one side and up the other, and still again attempted to escape in the
same manner, but each time they were forced to retire precipitately by a
murderous fire from the Confederate batteries.Not only was the
Confederate fire disastrous upon the approach and the successive repulses
by the foe, but it also inflicted great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army in front of Marye's Hill.The Confederates' effective and
successful work on Marye's Hill in this battle was not alone due to the
natural strength of their position, but also to the skill and generalship
of the leaders, and to the gallantry, courage, and well-directed aim of
their cannoneers and infantry.Six times the heroic Union troops dashed against the invulnerable
position, each time to be repulsed with terrific loss.General Couch, who
had command of the Second Corps, viewing the scene of battle from the
steeple of the court-house with General Howard, says: "The whole plain was
covered with men, prostrate and dropping, the live men running here and
there, and in front closing upon each other, and the wounded coming back.I had never before seen fighting like that, nothing approaching it in
terrible uproar and destruction."General Howard reports that Couch exclaimed: "Oh, great God!see how our
men, our poor fellows, are falling!"At half-past one Couch signaled
Burnside: "I am losing.The point and method of attack made by Sumner was anticipated by the
Confederates, careful preparation having been made to meet it.The fire
from the Confederate batteries harassed the Union lines, and as they
advanced steadily, heroically, without hurrah or battle-cry, the ranks
were cut to pieces by canister and shell and musket-balls.Heavy artillery
fire was poured into the Union ranks from front, right, and left with
frightful results.Quickly filling up the decimated ranks they approached
the stone wall masking the death-trap where General Cobb lay with a strong
force awaiting the approach.Torrents of lead poured into the bodies of
the defenseless men, slaying, crushing, destroying the proud army of a few
hours before.As though in pity, a cloud of smoke momentarily shut out the
wretched scene but brought no balm to the helpless victims of this awful
carnage.The ground was so thickly strewn with dead bodies as seriously to
impede the movements of a renewed attack.These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some apprehension on the part of General Lee, who said
to Longstreet after the third attack, "General, they are massing very
heavily and will break your line, I am afraid."But the great general's
fears proved groundless.General Cobb was borne from the field mortally wounded, and Kershaw took
his place in the desperate struggle.The storm of shot and shell which met
the assaults was terrific.Men fell almost in battalions; the dead and
wounded lay in heaps.Late in the day the dead bodies, which had become
frozen from the extreme cold, were stood up in front of the soldiers as a
protection against the awful fire to shield the living, and at night were
set up as dummy sentinels.The steadiness of the Union troops, and the silent, determined heroism of
the rank and file in these repeated, but hopeless, assaults upon the
Confederate works, were marvelous, and amazed even their officers.The
real greatness in a battle is the fearless courage, the brave and heroic
conduct, of the men under withering fire.It was the enlisted men who were
the glory of the army.It was they, the rank and file, who stood in the
front, closed the gaps, and were mowed down in swaths like grass by cannon
and musket-balls.After the sixth disastrous attempt to carry the works of the Confederate
left it was night; the Federal army was repulsed and had retired; hope was
abandoned, and it was seen that the day was lost to the Union side.Then
the shattered Army of the Potomac sought to gather the stragglers and care
for the wounded.Fredericksburg, the beautiful Virginia town, was a
pitiable scene in contrast to its appearance a few days before.Ancestral
homes were turned into barracks and hospitals.The charming drives and
stately groves, the wonted pleasure grounds of Colonial dames and Southern
cavaliers, were not filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but with
war horses, soldiers, and military accouterments.Aside from desultory
firing by squads and skirmishers at intervals there was no renewal of the
conflict.The bloody carnage was over, the plan of Burnside had ended in failure,
and thousands of patriotic and brave men, blindly obedient to their
country's command, were the toll exacted from the Union army.Burnside,
wild with anguish at what he had done, walking the floor of his tent,
exclaimed, "Oh, those men--those men over there," pointing to the
battlefield, "I am thinking of them all the time."In his report of the
battle to Washington, Burnside gave reasons for the issue, and in a manly
way took the responsibility upon himself, and most highly commended his
officers and men.He said, "For the failure in the attack I am
responsible, as the extreme gallantry, courage, and endurance shown by
them [officers and men] were never excelled."President Lincoln's verdict in regard to this battle is adverse to the
almost unanimous opinion of the historians.In his reply, December 22d, to
General Burnside's report of the battle, he says, "Although you were not
successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an
accident."Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of the command of
the Army of the Potomac, however, on January 25, 1863, and was succeeded
by General Hooker.The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
12,653, and the Confederates lost 5,377.After the battle the wounded lay on the field in their agony exposed to
the freezing cold for forty-eight hours before arrangements were effected
to care for them.Many were burned to death by the long, dead grass
becoming ignited by cannon fire.The scene witnessed by the army of those
screaming, agonizing, dying comrades was dreadful and heart-rending.Burnside's plan had been to renew the battle, but the overwhelming opinion
of the other officers prevailed.The order was withdrawn and the defeated
Union army slipped away under the cover of darkness on December 15th, and
encamped in safety across the river.The battle of Fredericksburg had
passed into history.[Illustration: THE SECOND LEADER AGAINST RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Major-General Ambrose Everett Burnside was a West Point graduate, inventor
of a breech-loading rifle, commander of a brigade in the first battle of
Bull Run, captor of Roanoke Island and Newberne (North Carolina), and
commander of the Federal left at Antietam.He was appointed to the command
of the Army of the Potomac and succeeded General George B. McClellan on
November 8, 1862.He was a brave soldier, but was an impatient leader and
inclined to be somewhat reckless.He pressed rapidly his advance against
Lee and massed his entire army along Stafford Heights, on the east bank of
the Rappahannock, opposite Fredericksburg.According to General W. B.
Franklin (who commanded the left grand division of the army), the notion
that a serious battle was necessary to Federal control of the town "was
not entertained by any one."General Sumner (who led the advance of
Burnside's army) held this opinion but he had not received orders to cross
the river.Crossing was delayed nearly a month and this delay resulted in
the Federal disaster on December 13th.This put an abrupt end to active
operations by Burnside against Lee.This picture was taken at Warrenton,
November 24th, on the eve of the departure of the army for its march to
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: THE DETAINED GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In the foreground, looking from what is
approximately the same position as the opening picture, are three guns of
Tyler's Connecticut battery.It was from all along this ridge that the
town had suffered its bombardment in December of the previous year.Again
the armies were separated by the Rappahannock River.There was a new
commander at the head of the Army of the Potomac--General Hooker.The
plundered and deserted town now held by the Confederates was to be made
the objective of another attack.The heights beyond were once more to be
assaulted; bridges were to be rebuilt.This ground
of much contention was deserted some time before Lee advanced to his
invasion of Pennsylvania.Very slowly the inhabitants of Fredericksburg
had returned to their ruined homes.The town was a vast Federal cemetery,
the dead being buried in gardens and backyards, for during its occupancy
almost every dwelling had been turned into a temporary hospital.After the
close of the war these bodies were gathered and a National Cemetery was
established on Willis' Hill, on Marye's Heights, the point successfully
defended by Lee's veterans.Heavy pontoon-boats, each on its separate wagon, were sometimes as
necessary as food or ammunition.At every important crossing of the many
rivers that had to be passed in the Peninsula Campaign the bridges had
been destroyed.There were few places where these streams were fordable.Pontoons, therefore, made a most important adjunct to the Army of the
Potomac.[Illustration: PONTOON-BOATS IN TRANSIT]

scene.On those memorable days of December 11 and 12, 1862, from these
very trenches shown in the foreground, the ragged gray riflemen saw on
that hillside across the river the blue of the uniforms of the massed
Federal troops.The lines of tents made great white spaces, but the ground
could hardly be seen for the host of men who were waiting, alas!to die by
thousands on this coveted shore.From these hills, too, burst an incessant
flaming and roaring cannon fire.Siege-guns and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.Every house became a
target, though deserted except for a few hardy and venturesome riflemen.Ruined and battered and
bloody, Fredericksburg three times was a Federal hospital, and its
backyards became little cemeteries.[Illustration: A TARGET AT FREDERICKSBURG FOR THE FEDERAL GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE BRIDGES THAT A BAND OF MUSIC THREATENED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At Franklin Crossing, on the Rappahannock, occurred an incident that
proves how little things may change the whole trend of the best-laid
plans.The left Union wing under the command of General Franklin, composed
of the First Army Corps under General Reynolds, and the Sixth under
General W. F. Smith, was crossing to engage in the battle of
Fredericksburg.For two days they poured across these yielding planks
between the swaying boats to the farther shore.Now, in the crossing of
bridges, moving bodies of men must break step or even well-built
structures might be threatened.The colonel of one of the regiments in
General Devens' division that led the van ordered his field music to
strike up just as the head of the column swept on to the flimsy planking;
before the regiment was half-way across, unconsciously the men had fallen
into step and the whole fabric was swaying to the cadenced feet.Vibrating
like a great fiddle-string, the bridge would have sunk and parted, but a
keen eye had seen the danger.was the order, and a
staff officer spurred his horse through the men, shouting at top voice.The lone charge was made through the marching column: some jumped into the
pontoons to avoid the hoofs; a few went overboard; but the head of the
column was reached at last, and the music stopped.A greater blunder than
this, however, took place on the plains beyond.Owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, 37,000 troops were never brought into action;
17,000 men on their front bore the brunt of a long day's fighting.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FAMOUS "IRISH BRIGADE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]"The Irish Brigade" (consisting of the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts,
Sixty-third, Sixty-ninth and Eighty-eighth New York and the One Hundred
and Sixteenth Pennsylvania) was commanded by General Thomas F. Meagher and
advanced in Hancock's Division to the first assault at Marye's Heights, on
December 13, 1862.In this charge the Irish soldiers moved steadily up the
ridge until within a few yards of a sunken road, from which unexpected
fire mowed them down.Of the 1,315 men which Meagher led into battle, 545
fell in that charge.The officer standing is Colonel Patrick Kelly, of the
Eighty-eighth New York, who was one of the valiant heroes of this charge,
and succeeded to the command of the Irish Brigade after General Meagher.The officer seated is Captain Clooney, of the
same regiment, who was killed at Antietam.Sitting next to him is Father
Dillon, Chaplain of the Sixty-third New York, and to the right Father
Corby, Chaplain of the Eighty-eighth New York; the latter gave absolution
to Caldwell's Division, of Hancock's Corps, under a very heavy fire at
Gettysburg.By the side of Colonel Kelly stands a visiting priest.The
identification of this group has been furnished by Captain W. L. D.
O'Grady, of the Eighty-eighth New York.[Illustration: THE SUMMIT OF SLAUGHTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Marye's House marked the center of the Confederate position on the
Heights, before which the Federals fell three deep in one of the bravest
and bloodiest assaults of the war.The eastern boundary of the Marye
estate was a retaining wall, along which ran a sunken road; on the other
side of this was a stone wall, shoulder high, forming a perfect infantry
parapet.Here two brigades of Confederates were posted and on the crest
above them were the supporting batteries, while the <DW72> between was
honeycombed with the rifle-pits of the sharpshooters, one of which is seen
in the picture.Six times did the Federals, raked by the deadly fire of
the Washington Artillery, advance to within a hundred yards of the sunken
road, only to be driven back by the rapid volleys of the Confederate
infantry concealed there.Less than three of every five men in Hancock's
division came back from their charge on these death-dealing heights.The
complete repulse of the day and the terrific slaughter were the barren
results of an heroic effort to obey orders.[Illustration: THE FATEFUL CROSSING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.From this, the Lacy House, which Sumner had made his headquarters, he
directed the advance of his right grand division of the Army of the
Potomac on December 11, 1862.Little did he dream that his men of the
Second Corps were to bear the brunt of the fighting and the most crushing
blow of the defeat on the 13th.Soon after three o'clock on the morning of
the 11th the columns moved out with alacrity to the river bank and before
daybreak, hidden at first by the fog, the pontoniers began building the
bridges.Confederate sharpshooters drove off the working party from the
bridge below the Lacy House and also from the middle bridge farther down.As the mist cleared, volunteers ferried themselves over in the boats and
drove off the riflemen.At last, at daybreak of the 12th, the town of
Fredericksburg was occupied, but the whole of another foggy day was
consumed in getting the army concentrated on the western shore.Nineteen
batteries (one hundred and four guns) accompanied Sumner's troops, but all
save seven of these were ordered back or left in the streets of
Fredericksburg.Late on the morning of the 13th the confused and belated
orders began to arrive from Burnside's headquarters across the river; one
was for Sumner to assault the Confederate batteries on Marye's Heights.At
nightfall Sumner's men retired into Fredericksburg, leaving 4,800 dead or
wounded on the field."Oh, those men, those men over there!I cannot get
them out of my mind!"wailed Burnside in an agony of failure.Yet he was
planning almost in the same breath to lead in person his old command, the
Ninth Corps, in another futile charge in the morning.On the night of the
14th, better judgment prevailed and the order came to retire across the
Rappahannock.[Illustration: NEW LEADERS AND NEW PLANS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These were the men whose work it was,
during the winter after Fredericksburg, to restore the _esprit de corps_
of the Army of the Potomac.The tireless energy and magnetic personality
of Hooker soon won officers from their disaffection and put an end to
desertions--which had been going on at the rate of two hundred per day
before he took command.By spring everything seemed propitious for an
aggressive campaign, the plans for which were brilliantly drawn and at
first vigorously carried out, giving truth to Lincoln's expressed belief
that Hooker was "a trained and skilful soldier."In that remarkable letter
of admonition to Hooker upon assuming command, Lincoln added: "But beware
of rashness, beware of rashness; with energy and with sleepless vigilance
go forward and give us victories."By some strange fate it was not
rashness but quite the contrary which compassed the failure of "Fighting
Joe" Hooker at Chancellorsville.His first forward advance was executed
with his usual bold initiative.Before Lee could fully divine his purpose,
Hooker with thirty-six thousand men was across his left flank in a
favorable position, with the main body of his army at hand ready to give
battle.Then came Hooker's inexplicable order to fall back upon
Chancellorsville.That very night, consulting in the abandoned Federal
position, Lee and Jackson formed the plan which drove Hooker back across
the Rappahannock in ignominious defeat.CHANCELLORSVILLE AND JACKSON'S FLANKING MARCH


After the Fredericksburg campaign the Union forces encamped at Falmouth
for the winter, while Lee remained with the Southern army on the site of
his successful contest at Fredericksburg.Thus the two armies lay facing
each other within hailing distance, across the historic river, waiting for
the coming of spring.Major-General Joseph Hooker, popularly known as
"Fighting Joe" Hooker, who had succeeded Burnside in command of the Army
of the Potomac, soon had the troops on a splendid campaign footing.His
force was between 125,000 and 130,000 men; Lee's, about 60,000.Hooker conceived a plan of campaign which was ingenious and masterful, and
had he carried it out there would have been a different story to tell
about Chancellorsville.The plan was to deploy a portion of the army to
serve as a decoy to Lee, while the remainder of the host at the same time
occupied the vicinity of Chancellorsville, a country mansion, in the
center of the wilderness that stretched along the Rappahannock.Lee was a great general and a master in strategy.He had learned of
Hooker's plan and, paying but little attention to Sedgwick east of
Fredericksburg, had turned to face Hooker.By a rapid night march he met
the Union army before it had reached its destination.He was pushed back,
however, by Sykes, of Meade's corps, who occupied the position assigned to
him.Meade was on the left, and Slocum on the right, with adequate support
in the rear.All was in readiness and most favorable for the "certain
destruction" of the Confederates predicted by "Fighting Joe" when, to the
amazement and consternation of all his officers, Hooker ordered the whole
army to retire to the position it had occupied the day before, leaving the
advantage to his opponents.Lee quickly moved his army into the position thus relinquished, and began
feeling the Federal lines with skirmishers and some cannonading during the
evening of May 1st.By the next morning the two armies were in line of
battle.The danger in which the Confederate army now found itself was extreme.One
large Federal army was on its front, while another was at its rear, below
Fredericksburg.But Lee threw the hopes of success into one great and
decisive blow at Hooker's host.Dividing an army in the face of the foe is
extremely dangerous and contrary to all accepted theories of military
strategy; but there comes a time when such a course proves the salvation
of the legions in peril.Such was the case at Chancellorsville on May 2,
1863.the cannonading began its death-song and was soon followed by
infantry demonstrations, but without serious results.Early in the afternoon, Hooker by a ruse was beguiled into the
belief that Lee's army was in full retreat.What Hooker had seen and
believed to be a retreat was the marching of Jackson's forces, about
twenty-six thousand strong, from the battlefield.What he did not see,
however, was that, after a few miles, Jackson turned abruptly and made for
the right flank of the Federal host, the Eleventh Corps, under Howard.It
was after half-past five when Jackson broke from the woods into which he
had marched in a paralyzing charge upon the unprepared troops of Howard.The approach of this Confederate force was first intimated to the Federals
by the bending of shrubbery, the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight, as before a storm.Then appeared a few
skirmishers, then a musket volley, and then the storm broke in all its
fury--the war scream, the rattling musketry, the incessant roar of cannon.The knowledge that "Old Jack" was on
the field was inspiration enough for them.The charge was so precipitous,
so unexpected and terrific that it was impossible for the Federals to hold
their lines and stand against the impact of that awful onslaught which
carried everything before it.The regiments in Jackson's path, resisting
his advance, were cut to pieces and swept along as by a tidal wave, rolled
up like a scroll, multitudes of men, horses, mules, and cattle being piled
in an inextricable mass.Characteristic of Jackson's brilliant and
unexpected movements, it was like an electric flash, knocking the Eleventh
Corps into impotence, as Jackson expected it would.This crowning and
final stroke of Jackson's military genius was not impromptu, but the
result of his own carefully worked-out plan, which had been approved by
Lee.General Hooker was spending the late afternoon hours in his headquarters
at the Chancellor house.To the eastward there was considerable firing,
where his men were carrying out the plan of striking Lee in flank.Jackson
was retreating, of that he was sure, and Sickles, with Pleasanton's
cavalry and other reenforcements, was in pursuit.About half-past six the sounds of battle grew suddenly louder
and seemed to come from another direction.A staff-officer went to the
front of the house and turned his field-glass toward the west.At the startled cry Hooker sprang upon his horse and dashed down the road.He encountered portions of the Eleventh Corps pouring out of the forest--a
badly mixed crowd of men, wagons, and ambulances.They brought the news
that the right wing was overwhelmed.Hurriedly Hooker sought his old
command, Berry's division of the Third Corps, stationed in support of the
Eleventh.An officer who witnessed the scene says the division advanced with a firm
and steady step, cleaving the multitude of disbanded Federals as the bow
of a vessel cleaves the waves of the sea.It struck the advance of the
Confederates obliquely and checked it, with the aid of the Twelfth Corps
artillery.A dramatic, though tragic, feature of the rout was the charge of the
Eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, under Major Keenan, in the face of almost
certain death, to save the artillery of the Third Corps from capture.The
guns rested upon low ground and within reach of the Confederates.The
Federals had an equal opportunity to seize the artillery, but required a
few minutes to prepare themselves for action.The Confederate advance must
be checked for these few moments, and for this purpose Keenan gallantly
led his five hundred cavalrymen into the woods, while his comrades brought
the guns to bear upon the columns in gray.He gained the necessary time,
but lost his life at the head of his regiment, together with Captain
Arrowsmith and Adjutant Haddock, who fell by his side.The light of day had faded from the gruesome scene.The mighty turmoil was
silenced as darkness gathered, but the day's carnage was not ended.No
camp-fires were lighted in the woods or on the plain.The two hostile
forces were concealed in the darkness, watching through the shadows,
waiting for--they knew not what.Finally at midnight the order "Forward"
was repeated in subdued tones along the lines of Sickles' corps.Out over
the open and into the deep, dark thicket the men in blue pursued their
stealthy advance upon the Confederate position.Then the tragedies of the
night were like that of the day, and the moon shed her peaceful rays down
upon those shadowy figures as they struggled forward through the woods, in
the ravines, over the hillocks.The Federals, at heavy loss, gained the
position, and the engagement assumed the importance of a victory.It was on this day that death robbed the South of one of her most beloved
warriors.After darkness had overspread the land, Jackson, accompanied by
members of his staff, undertook a reconnaissance of the Federal lines.He came upon a line of Union infantry lying
on its arms and was forced to turn back along the plank road, on both
sides of which he had stationed his own men with orders to fire upon any
body of men approaching from the direction of the Federal battle-lines.The little cavalcade of Confederate officers galloped along the highway,
directly toward the ambuscade, and apparently forgetful of the strict
orders left with the skirmishers.A sudden flash of flame lighted the
scene for an instant, and within that space of time the Confederacy was
deprived of one of its greatest captains.Jackson was severely wounded,
and by his own men and through his own orders.When the news spread
through Jackson's corps and through the Confederate army the grief of the
Southern soldiers was heartbreaking to witness.The sorrow spread even
into the ranks of the Federal army, which, while opposed to the wounded
general on many hard-fought battle-grounds, had learned to respect and
admire "Stonewall" Jackson.The loss of Jackson to the South was incalculable.Lee had pronounced him
the right arm of the whole army.Next to Lee, Jackson was considered the
ablest general in the Confederate army.His shrewdness of judgment, his
skill in strategy, his lightning-like strokes, marked him as a unique and
brilliant leader.Devoutly religious, gentle and noble in character, the
nation that was not to be disunited lost a great citizen, as the
Confederate army lost a great captain, when a few days later General
Jackson died.That night orders passed from the Federal headquarters to Sedgwick, below
Fredericksburg, eleven miles away.Between him and Hooker stood the
Confederate army, flushed with its victories of the day.Immediately in
his front was Fredericksburg, with a strong guard of Southern warriors.Beyond loomed Marye's Heights, the battle-ground on which Burnside had in
the preceding winter left so many of his brave men in the vain endeavor to
drive the Confederate defenders from the crest.The courageous Sedgwick, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles that lay
on the road to Chancellorsville, responded immediately to Hooker's order.He was already on the south side of the river, but he was farther away
than Hooker supposed.Shortly after midnight he began a march that was
fraught with peril and death.Strong resistance was offered the advancing
blue columns as they came to the threshold of Fredericksburg, but they
swept on and over the defenders, and at dawn were at the base of the
heights.On the crest waved the standards of the Confederate Washington
Artillery.At the foot of the <DW72> was the stone wall before which the
Federals had fought and died but a few months before, in the battle of
Fredericksburg.Reenforcements were arriving in the Confederate trenches
constantly.The crest and <DW72>s bristled with cannon and muskets.The
pathways around the heights were barricaded.The route to the front seemed
blocked; still, the cry for help from Hooker was resounding in the ears of
Sedgwick.Gathering his troops, he attacked directly upon the stone wall and on up
the hillside, in the face of a terrific storm of artillery and musketry.The first assault failed; a flank movement met with no better success; and
the morning was nearly gone when the Confederates finally gave way at the
point of the bayonet before the irresistible onset of men in blue.The way
to Chancellorsville was open; but the cost to the Federals was appalling.Hundreds of the soldiers in blue lay wrapped in death upon the bloody
<DW72>s of Marye's Heights.It was the middle of the afternoon, and not at daybreak, as Hooker had
directed, when Sedgwick appeared in the rear of Lee's legions.A strong
force of Confederates under Early prevented his further advance toward a
juncture with Hooker's army at Chancellorsville.Since five o'clock in
the morning the battle had been raging at the latter place, and Jackson's
men, now commanded by Stuart, though being mowed down in great numbers,
vigorously pressed the attack of the day while crying out to one another
"Remember Jackson," as they thought of their wounded leader.While this engagement was at its height General Hooker, leaning against a
pillar of the Chancellor house, was felled to the ground, and for a moment
it was thought he was killed.The pillar had been shattered by a
cannon-ball.Hooker soon revived under the doctor's care and with great
force of will he mounted his horse and showed himself to his anxious
troops.He then withdrew his army to a stronger position, well guarded
with artillery.The Confederates did not attempt to assail it.The third
day's struggle at Chancellorsville was finished by noon, except in Lee's
rear, where Sedgwick fought all day, without success, to reach the main
body of Hooker's army.The Federals suffered very serious losses during
this day's contest.Even then it was believed that the advantage rested
with the larger Army of the Potomac and that the Federals had an
opportunity to win.Thirty-seven thousand Union troops, the First, and
three-quarters of the Fifth Corps, had been entirely out of the fight on
that day.Five thousand men of the Eleventh Corps, who were eager to
retrieve their misfortune, were also inactive.When night came, and the shades of darkness hid the sights of suffering on
the battlefield, the Federal army was resting in a huge curve, the left
wing on the Rappahannock and the right on the Rapidan.In this way the
fords across the rivers which led to safety were in control of the Army of
the Potomac.Lee moved his corps close to the bivouacs of the army in
blue.But, behind the Confederate battle-line, there was a new factor in
the struggle in the person of Sedgwick, with the remnants of his gallant
corps, which had numbered nearly twenty-two thousand when they started for
the front, but now were depleted by their terrific charge upon Marye's
Heights and the subsequent hard and desperate struggle with Early in the
afternoon.Lee was between two fires--Hooker in front and Sedgwick in the rear, both
of whose forces were too strong to be attacked simultaneously.Again the
daring leader of the Confederate legions did the unexpected, and divided
his army in the presence of the foe, though he was without the aid of his
great lieutenant, "Stonewall" Jackson.During the night Lee made his preparations, and when dawn appeared in the
eastern skies the movement began.Sedgwick, weak and battered by his
contact with Early on the preceding afternoon, resisted bravely, but to no
avail, and the Confederates closed in upon him on three sides, leaving the
way to Banks's Ford on the Rappahannock open to escape.Slowly the
Federals retreated and, as night descended, rested upon the river bank.After dark the return to the northern side was begun by Sedgwick's men,
and the Chancellorsville campaign was practically ended.The long, deep trenches full of Federal and Confederate dead told the
awful story of Chancellorsville.If we gaze into these trenches, which by
human impulse we are led to do, after the roar and din of the carnage is
still, the scene greeting the eye will never be forgotten.Side by side,
the heroes in torn and bloody uniforms, their only shrouds, were gently
laid.The Union loss in killed and wounded was a little over seventeen thousand,
and it cost the South thirteen thousand men to gain this victory on the
banks of the Rappahannock.The loss to both armies in officers was very
heavy.The two armies were weary and more than decimated.It appeared that both
were glad at the prospect of a cessation of hostilities.On the night of
May 5th, in a severe storm, Hooker conveyed his corps safely across the
river and settled the men again in their cantonments of the preceding
winter at Falmouth.The Confederates returned to their old encampment at
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: A MAN OF WHOM MUCH WAS EXPECTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A daring and experienced veteran of the Mexican
War, Hooker had risen in the Civil War from brigade commander to be the
commander of a grand division of the Army of the Potomac, and had never
been found wanting.His advancement to the head of the Army of the
Potomac, on January 26, 1863, was a tragic episode in his own career and
in that of the Federal arms.Gloom hung heavy over the North after
Fredericksburg.Upon Hooker fell the difficult task of redeeming the
unfulfilled political pledges for a speedy lifting of that gloom.It was
his fortune only to deepen it.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON--TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS MORTAL WOUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The austere, determined features of the victor of Chancellorsville, just
as they appeared two weeks before the tragic shot that cost the
Confederacy its greatest Lieutenant-General--and, in the opinion of sound
historians, its chief hope for independence.Only once had a war
photograph of Jackson been taken up to April, 1863, when, just before the
movement toward Chancellorsville, he was persuaded to enter a
photographer's tent at Hamilton's Crossing, some three miles below
Fredericksburg, and to sit for his last portrait.At a glance one can feel
the self-expression and power in this stern worshiper of the God of
Battles; one can understand the eulogy written by the British military
historian, Henderson: "The fame of 'Stonewall' Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South; it has become the birthright
of every man privileged to call himself an American."[Illustration: WHERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON FELL]

In this tangled nook Lee's right-hand man was shot through a terrible
mistake of his own soldiers.After his
brilliant flank march, the evening attack on the rear of Hooker's army had
just been driven home.About half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond
his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance.A single rifle-shot rang
out in the darkness.The outposts of the two armies were engaged.Jackson
turned toward his own line, where the Eighteenth North Carolina was
stationed.The regiment, keenly on the alert and startled by the group of
strange horsemen riding through the gloom, fired a volley that brought
several men and horses to the earth.Jackson was struck once in the right
hand and twice in the left arm, a little below the shoulder.His horse
dashed among the trees; but with his bleeding right hand Jackson succeeded
in seizing the reins and turning the frantic animal back into the road.Only with difficulty was the general taken to the rear so that his wounds
might be dressed.To his attendants he said, "Tell them simply that you
have a wounded Confederate officer."To one who asked if he was seriously
hurt, he replied: "Don't bother yourself about me.Win the battle first
and attend to the wounded afterward."He was taken to Guiney's Station.At
first it was hoped that he would recover, but pneumonia set in and his
strength gradually ebbed.On Sunday evening, May 10th, he uttered the
words which inspired the young poet, Sidney Lanier, to write his elegy,
beautiful in its serene resignation.[Illustration: THE STONE WALL AT FREDERICKSBURG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind the deadly stone wall of Marye's Heights after Sedgwick's men had
swept across it in the gallant charge of May 3, 1863.This was one of the
strongest natural positions stormed during the war.In front of this wall
the previous year, nearly 6,000 of Burnside's men had fallen, and it was
not carried.Again in the Chancellorsville campaign Sedgwick's Sixth Corps
was ordered to assault it.It was defended the second time with the same
death-dealing stubbornness but with less than a fourth of the former
numbers--9,000 Confederates against 20,000 Federals.At eleven o'clock in
the morning the line of battle, under Colonel Hiram Burnham, moved out
over the awful field of the year before, supported to right and left by
flanking columns.Up to within twenty-five yards of the wall they pressed,
when again the flame of musketry fire belched forth, laying low in six
minutes 36.5 per cent.The
assailants wavered and rallied, and then with one impulse both columns and
line of battle hurled themselves upon the wall in a fierce hand-to-hand
combat.A soldier of the Seventh Massachusetts happened to peer through a
crack in a board fence and saw that it covered the flank of the double
line of Confederates in the road.Up and over the fence poured the
Federals and drove the Confederates from the heights.[Illustration: THE WORK OF ONE SHELL

Federals swarmed up and over the ridge above, driving the Confederates
from the rifle-pits, capturing the guns of the famous Washington Artillery
which had so long guarded the Heights, and inflicting slaughter upon the
assaulting columns.If Sedgwick had had cavalry he could have crushed the
divided forces of Early and cleared the way for a rapid advance to attack
Lee's rear.In the picture we see Confederate caisson wagons and horses

Chancellorsville and sent against Sedgwick on the afternoon of the 4th.[Illustration: THE DEMOLISHED HEADQUARTERS]

From this mansion, Hooker's headquarters during the battle of
Chancellorsville, he rode away after the injury he received there on May
3d, never to return.The general, dazed after Jackson's swoop upon the
right, was besides in deep anxiety as to Sedgwick.The latter's forty
thousand men had not yet come up.Hooker was unwilling to suffer further
loss without the certainty of his cooperation.The movement was the signal for increased artillery fire from
the Confederate batteries, marking the doom of the old Chancellor house.Its end was accompanied by some heartrending scenes.Major Bigelow thus
describes them: "Missiles pierced the walls or struck in the brickwork;
shells exploded in the upper rooms, setting the building on fire; the
chimneys were demolished and their fragments rained down upon the wounded
about the building.All this time the women and children (including some
slaves) of the Chancellor family, nineteen persons in all, were in the
cellar.The wounded were removed from in and around the building, men of
both armies nobly assisting one another in the work."[Illustration: RED MEN WHO SUFFERED IN SILENCE

place.We think of him with the tomahawk and scalping-knife and have
difficulty in conceiving him in the ranks, drilling, doing police duty,
and so on.Yet more than three thousand Indians were enlisted in the
Federal army.The Confederates enlisted many more in Missouri, Arkansas,
and Texas.In the Federal army the red men were used as advance
sharpshooters and rendered meritorious service.This photograph shows some
of the wounded Indian sharpshooters on Marye's Heights after the second
battle of Fredericksburg.A hospital orderly is attending to the wants of
the one on the left-hand page, and the wounds of the others have been

group of four Indian sharpshooters, each with the loss of a limb--of an
arm at the shoulder, of a leg at the knee, or with an amputation at the
thigh.They neither spoke nor moaned, but suffered and died, mute in their
agony.During the campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Appomattox,
Captain Ely S. Parker, a gigantic Indian, became one of Grant's favorite
aids.Before the close of the war he had been promoted to the rank of
colonel, and it was he who drafted in a beautiful handwriting the terms of
Lee's surrender.He stood over six feet in height and was a conspicuous
figure on Grant's staff.The Southwestern Indians engaged in some of the
earliest battles under General Albert Pike, a Northerner by birth, but a
Southern sympathizer.[Illustration: THE BOMBARDMENT OF PORT HUDSON._Painted by E. Packbauer._

VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON

    On the banks of this, the greatest river in the world, the most
    decisive and far-reaching battle of the war was fought.Here at
    Vicksburg over one hundred thousand gallant soldiers and a powerful
    fleet of gunboats and ironclads in terrible earnestness for forty days
    and nights fought to decide whether the new Confederate States should
    be cut in twain; whether the great river should flow free to the Gulf,
    or should have its commerce hindered.We all know the result--the
    Union army under General Grant, and the Union navy under Admiral
    Porter were victorious.The Confederate army, under General Pemberton,
    numbering thirty thousand men, was captured and General Grant's army
    set free for operating in other fields.It was a staggering blow from
    which the Confederacy never rallied.--_Lieutenant-General Stephen D.
    Lee, C. S. A., at the dedication of the Massachusetts Volunteers'
    statue at the Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg,
    Mississippi, November 14, 1903._


The Mississippi River, in its lower course, winds like a mighty serpent
from side to side along a vast alluvial bottom, which in places is more
than forty miles in width.On the eastern bank, these great coils here and
there sweep up to the bluffs of the highlands of Tennessee and
Mississippi.On these cliffs are situated Memphis, Port Hudson, Grand
Gulf, and Vicksburg.The most important of these from a military point of
view was Vicksburg, often called the "Gibraltar of the West."Situated two
hundred feet above the current, on a great bend of the river, its cannon
could command the waterway for miles in either direction, while the
obstacles in the way of a land approach were almost equally
insurmountable.The Union arms had captured New Orleans, in the spring of 1862, and
Memphis in June of that year; but the Confederates still held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson and the two hundred and fifty miles of river that lies
between them.The military object of the Federal armies in the West was
to gain control of the entire course of the great Mississippi that it
might "roll unvexed to the sea," to use Lincoln's terse expression, and
that the rich States of the Southwest, from which the Confederacy drew
large supplies and thousands of men for her armies, might be cut off from
the rest of the South.If Vicksburg were captured, Port Hudson must fall.The problem, therefore, was how to get control of Vicksburg.On the promotion of Halleck to the command of all the armies of the North,
with headquarters at Washington, Grant was left in superior command in the
West and the great task before him was the capture of the "Gibraltar of
the West."Vicksburg might have been occupied by the Northern armies at
any time during the first half of the year 1862, but in June of that year
General Bragg sent Van Dorn with a force of fifteen thousand to occupy and
fortify the heights.Van Dorn was a man of prodigious energy.In a short
time he had hundreds of men at work planting batteries, digging rifle-pits
above the water front and in the rear of the town, mounting heavy guns and
building bomb-proof magazines in tiers along the hillsides.All through
the summer, the work progressed under the direction of Engineer S. H.
Lockett, and by the coming of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.From the uncompleted batteries on the Vicksburg bluffs, the citizens and
the garrison soldiers viewed the advance division of Farragut's fleet,
under Commander Lee, in the river, on May 18, 1862.Fifteen hundred
infantry were on board, under command of General Thomas Williams, and with
them was a battery of artillery.Williams reconnoitered the works, and
finding them too strong for his small force he returned to occupy Baton
Rouge.The authorities at Washington now sent Farragut peremptory orders
to clear the Mississippi and accordingly about the middle of June, a
flotilla of steamers and seventeen mortar schooners, under Commander D. D.
Porter, departed from New Orleans and steamed up the river.Simultaneously Farragut headed a fleet of three war vessels and seven
gunboats, carrying one hundred and six guns, toward Vicksburg from Baton
Rouge.Many transports accompanied the ships from Baton Rouge, on which
there were three thousand of Williams' troops.The last days of June witnessed the arrival of the combined naval forces
of Farragut and Porter below the Confederate stronghold.Williams
immediately disembarked his men on the Louisiana shore, opposite
Vicksburg, and they were burdened with implements required in digging
trenches and building levees.The mighty Mississippi, at this point and in those days, swept in a
majestic bend and formed a peninsula of the western, or Louisiana shore.Vicksburg was situated on the eastern, or Mississippi shore, below the top
of the bend.Its batteries of cannon commanded the river approach for
miles in either direction.Federal engineers quickly recognized the
strategic position of the citadel on the bluff; and also as quickly saw a
method by which the passage up and down the river could be made
comparatively safe for their vessels, and at the same time place Vicksburg
"high and dry" by cutting a channel for the Mississippi through the neck
of land that now held it in its sinuous course.While Farragut stormed the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Williams
began the tremendous task of diverting the mighty current across the
peninsula.Farragut's bombardment by his entire fleet failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon-guards, although the defenders likewise failed to stop
the progress of the fleet.The Federal naval commander then determined to
dash past the fortifications, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous cannonade that would
fall upon his flotilla.Early in the morning of June 28th the thrilling
race against death began, and after two hours of terrific bombardment
aided by the mortar boats stationed on both banks, Farragut's fleet with
the exception of three vessels passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg, with a loss of fifteen killed and thirty wounded.On the 1st of July Flag-Officer Davis with his river gunboats arrived from
Memphis and joined Farragut.Williams and his men, including one thousand <DW64>s, labored like Titans
to complete their canal, but a sudden rise of the river swept away the
barriers with a terrific roar, and the days of herculean labor went for
naught.Again Williams' attempt to subdue the stronghold was abandoned,
and he returned with his men when Farragut did, on July 24th, to Baton
Rouge to meet death there on August 5th when General Breckinridge made a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to drive the Union forces from the
Louisiana capital.Farragut urged upon General Halleck the importance of occupying the city
on the bluff with a portion of his army; but that general gave no heed;
and while even then it was too late to secure the prize without a contest,
it would have been easy in comparison to that which it required a year
later.In the mean time, the river steamers took an important part in the
preliminary operations against the city.Davis remained at Memphis with
his fleet for about three weeks after the occupation of that city on the
6th of June, meanwhile sending four gunboats and a transport up the White
River, with the Forty-sixth Indiana regiment, under Colonel Fitch.The
object of the expedition, undertaken at Halleck's command, was to destroy
Confederate batteries and to open communication with General Curtis, who
was approaching from the west.It failed in the latter purpose but did
some effective work with the Southern batteries along the way.The one extraordinary incident of the expedition was the disabling of the
_Mound City_, one of the ironclad gunboats, and the great loss of life
that it occasioned.Charles the troops under Fitch were
landed, and the _Mound City_ moving up the river, was fired on by
concealed batteries under the direction of Lieutenant Dunnington.A
32-pound shot struck the vessel, crashed through the side and passed
through the steam-drum.Many of
the men were so quickly enveloped in the scalding vapor that they had no
chance to escape.Others leaped overboard, some being drowned and some
rescued through the efforts of the _Conestoga_ which was lying near.While
straining every nerve to save their lives, the men had to endure a shower
of bullets from Confederate sharpshooters on the river banks.Of the one
hundred and seventy-five officers and men of the _Mound City_ only
twenty-five escaped death or injury in that fearful catastrophe.Meanwhile, Colonel Fitch with his land forces rushed upon the Confederate
batteries and captured them.The unfortunate vessel was at length repaired
and returned to service.For some time it had been known in Federal military and naval circles that
a powerful ironclad similar to the famous _Monitor_ of Eastern waters was
being rushed to completion up the Yazoo.The new vessel was the
_Arkansas_.On July 15th, she steamed through the Union fleet, bravely
exchanging broadsides, and lodged safely under the guns of Vicksburg.That
evening the Federal boats in turn ran past the doughty _Arkansas_, but
failed to destroy her.The month of July had not been favorable to the Federal hopes.Farragut
had returned to New Orleans.General Williams had gone with him as far as
Baton Rouge.Davis now went with his fleet back to Helena.Halleck was
succeeded by Grant.Vicksburg entered upon a period of quiet.The city's experience of blood and fire
had only begun.During the summer and autumn of 1862, the one thought
uppermost in the mind of General Grant was how to gain possession of the
stronghold.He was already becoming known for his bull-dog tenacity.In
the autumn, two important changes took place, but one day apart.On
October 14th, General John C. Pemberton succeeded Van Dorn in command of
the defenses of Vicksburg, and on the next day David D. Porter succeeded
Davis as commander of the Federal fleet on the upper Mississippi.So arduous was the task of taking Vicksburg that the wits of General
Grant, and those of his chief adviser, General W. T. Sherman, were put to
the test in the last degree to accomplish the end.Grant knew that the
capture of this fortified city was of great importance to the Federal
cause, and that it would ever be looked upon as one of the chief acts in
the drama of the Civil War.The first plan attempted was to divide the army, Sherman taking part of it
from Memphis and down the Mississippi on transports, while Grant should
move southward along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad to
cooperate with Sherman, his movements to be governed by the efforts of the
scattered Confederate forces in Mississippi to block him.But the whole
plan was destined to failure, through the energies of General Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army near Grant's line of communication.The authorities at Washington preferred the river move upon Vicksburg, as
the navy could keep the line of communication open.The stronghold now
stood within a strong line of defense extending from Haynes' Bluff on the
Yazoo to Grand Gulf on the Mississippi, thirty miles below Vicksburg.To
prepare for Sherman's attack across the swamps of the Yazoo, Admiral
Porter made several expeditions up that tortuous stream to silence
batteries and remove torpedoes.In one of these he lost one of the Eads
ironclads, the _Cairo_, blown up by a torpedo, and in another the brave
Commander Gwin, one of the heroes of Shiloh, was mortally wounded.Sherman, with an army of thirty-two thousand men, left Memphis on December
20th, and landed a few days later some miles north of Vicksburg on the
banks of the Yazoo.On the 29th he made a daring attack in three columns
on the Confederate lines of defense at Chickasaw Bayou and suffered a
decisive repulse.His loss was nearly two thousand men; the Confederate
loss was scarcely two hundred.Two hundred feet above the bayou, beyond where the Federals were
approaching, towered the Chickasaw Bluffs, to which Pemberton hastened
troops from Vicksburg as soon as he learned Sherman's object.At the base
of the bluff, and stretching away to the north and west were swamps and
forests intersected by deep sloughs, overhung with dense tangles of vines
and cane-brakes.Federal valor vied with Confederate pluck in this fight
among the marshes and fever-infested jungle-land.One of Sherman's storming parties, under General G. W. Morgan, came upon a
broad and deep enlargement of the bayou, McNutt Lake, which interposed
between it and the Confederates in the rifle-pits on the <DW72>s and crest
of the bluff.In the darkness of the night of December 28th, the Federal
pontoniers labored to construct a passage-way across the lake.When
morning dawned the weary pontoniers were chagrined to discover their
well-built structure spanning a slough leading in another direction than
toward the base of the bluff.The bridge was quickly taken up, and the
Federals recommenced their labors, this time in daylight and within sight
and range of the Southern regiments on the hill.The men in blue worked
desperately to complete the span before driven away by the foe's cannon;
but the fire increased with every minute, and the Federals finally
withdrew.Another storming party attempted to assail the Confederates from across a
sandbar of the bayou, but was halted at the sight and prospect of
overcoming a fifteen-foot bank on the farther side.The crumbling bank was
surmounted with a levee three feet high; the steep sides of the barrier
had crumbled away, leaving an overhanging shelf, two feet wide.Two
companies of the Sixth Missouri regiment volunteered to cross the two
hundred yards of exposed passage, and to cut a roadway through the rotten
bank to allow their comrades a free path to the bluff beyond.To add to
the peril of the crossing, the sandbar was strewn with tangles of
undergrowth and fallen trees, and the Confederate shells and bullets were
raining upon the ground.Still, the gallant troops began their dash.From
the very start, a line of wounded and dead Missourians marked the passage
of the volunteers.The survivors reached the bank and desperately sought
to dig the roadway.From the shrubbery on the bank suddenly appeared
Confederate sharpshooters who poured their fire into the laboring
soldiers; the flame of the discharging muskets burned the clothing of the
Federals because the hostile forces were so close.Human endurance could
not stand before this carnage, and the brave Missourians fled from the
inferno.Sherman now found the northern pathway to Vicksburg impassable,
and withdrew his men to the broad Mississippi.Earlier in the same month had occurred two other events which, with the
defeat of Chickasaw, go to make up the triple disaster to the Federals.On
the 11th, General Nathan Forrest, one of the most brilliant cavalry
leaders on either side, began one of those destructive raids which
characterize the Civil War.With twenty-five hundred horsemen, Forrest
dashed unopposed through the country north of Grant's army, tore up sixty
miles of railroad and destroyed all telegraph lines.Meantime, on December 20th, the day on which Sherman left Memphis, General
Van Dorn pounced upon Holly Springs, in Mississippi, like an eagle on its
prey, capturing the guard of fifteen hundred men and burning the great
store of supplies, worth $1,500,000, which Grant had left there.Through
the raids of Forrest and Van Dorn, Grant was left without supplies and for
eleven days without communication with the outside world.He marched
northward to Grand Junction, in Tennessee, a distance of eighty miles,
living off the country.It was not until January 8, 1863, that he heard,
through Washington, of the defeat of Sherman in his assault on Chickasaw
Bluffs.Grant and Sherman had no thought of abandoning Vicksburg because of this
failure.But a month of unfortunate military dissension over rank in the
command of Sherman's army resulted in General John A. McClernand, armed
with authority from Washington, coming down from Illinois and superseding
Sherman.On January 11, 1864, he captured Arkansas Post, a stronghold on
the Arkansas River.But Grant, having authority to supersede McClernand in
the general proceedings against Vicksburg, did so, on January 30th, and
arguments on military precedence were forgotten.Grant was determined to lead his Army of the Tennessee below Vicksburg and
approach the city from the south, without breaking with his base of
supplies up the river.Two projects, both of which were destined to fail,
were under way during the winter and spring months of 1863.One of these
was to open a way for the river craft through Lake Providence, west of the
Mississippi, through various bayous and rivers into the Red River, a
detour of four hundred miles.Another plan was to cut a channel through the peninsula of the great bend
of the Mississippi, opposite Vicksburg.For six weeks, thousands of men
worked like marmots digging this ditch; but, meantime, the river was
rising and, on March 8th, it broke over the embankment and the men had to
run for their lives.Many horses were drowned and a great number of
implements submerged.The "Father of Waters" had put a decisive veto on
the project and it had to be given up.Still another plan that failed was
to cut through the Yazoo Pass and approach from the north by way of the
Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yazoo rivers.He _would_ take
Vicksburg.It was to transfer
his army by land down the west bank of the Mississippi to a point below
the city and approach it from the south and west.This necessitated the
running of the batteries by Porter's fleet--an extremely perilous
enterprise.The army was divided into four corps, commanded respectively
by Sherman, McClernand, McPherson, and Hurlbut.On March 29th, the movement of McClernand from Milliken's Bend
to a point opposite Grand Gulf was begun.He was soon followed by
McPherson and a few weeks later by Sherman.It required a month for the
army, with its heavy artillery, to journey through the swamps and bogs of
Louisiana.While this march was in progress, something far more exciting was taking
place on the river.Porter ran the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet.After days of preparation the fleet of vessels, protected by cotton bales
and hay about the vital parts of the boats, with heavy logs slung near the
water-line--seven gunboats, the ram _General Price_, three transports, and
various barges were ready for the dangerous journey on the night of April
16th.Silently in the darkness, they left their station near the mouth of
the Yazoo, at a quarter past nine.For an hour and a half all was silence
and expectancy.The bluffs on the east loomed black against the night sky.Suddenly, the flash of musketry fire pierced the darkness.In a few minutes every battery overlooking the river was a center of
spurting flame.A storm of shot and shell was rained upon the passing
vessels.The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shots and shell from the batteries.The air was filled with flying
missiles.Several houses on the Louisiana shore burst into flame and the
whole river from shore to shore was lighted with vivid distinctness.A
little later, a giant flame leaped from the bosom of the river.It burned to the
water's edge, nearly all its crew escaping to other vessels.Grant
described the scene as "magnificent, but terrible"; Sherman pronounced it
"truly sublime."By three in the morning, the fleet was below the city and ready to
cooperate with the army.One vessel had been destroyed, several others
were crippled; thirteen men had been wounded, but Grant had the assistance
he needed.About a week later, six more transports performed the same feat
and ran the batteries; each had two barges laden with forage and rations
in tow.Grant's next move was to transfer the army across the river and to secure
a base of supplies.There, on the bluff, was Grand Gulf, a tempting spot.But the Confederate guns showed menacingly over the brow of the hill.After a fruitless bombardment by the fleet on April 29th, it was decided
that a more practical place to cross the river must be sought below.Meanwhile, Sherman was ordered by his chief to advance upon the formidable
Haynes' Bluff, on the Yazoo River, some miles above the scene of his
repulse in the preceding December.The message had said, "Make a
demonstration on Haynes' Bluff, and make all the _show_ possible."Sherman's transports, and three of Porter's gunboats, were closely
followed by the Confederate soldiers who had been stationed at the series
of defenses on the range of hills, and when they arrived at Snyder's Mill,
just below Haynes' Bluff, on April 30th, General Hebert and several
Louisiana regiments were awaiting them.On that day and the next the
Confederates fiercely engaged the Union fleet and troops, and on May 2d
Sherman withdrew his forces to the western bank of the Mississippi and
hastened to Grant.The Confederates
had been prevented from sending reenforcements to Grand Gulf, and Grant's
crossing was greatly facilitated.The fleet passed the batteries of Grand Gulf and stopped at Bruinsburg,
six miles below.A landing was soon made, the army taken across on April
30th, and a march to Port Gibson, twelve miles inland, was begun.General
Bowen, Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, came out and offered battle.He was greatly outnumbered, but his troops fought gallantly throughout
most of the day, May 1st, before yielding the field.Port Gibson was then
occupied by the Union army, and Grand Gulf, no longer tenable, was
abandoned by the Confederates.Grant now prepared for a campaign into the interior of Mississippi.His
first intention was to cooperate with General Banks in the capture of Port
Hudson, after which they would move together upon Vicksburg.But hearing
that Banks would not arrive for ten days, Grant decided that he would
proceed to the task before him without delay.His army at that time
numbered about forty-three thousand.That under Pemberton probably forty
thousand, while there were fifteen thousand Confederate troops at Jackson,
Mississippi, soon to be commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who was
hastening to that capital.The Federal leader now determined on the bold plan of making a dash into
the interior of Mississippi, beating Johnston and turning on Pemberton
before their forces could be joined.This campaign is pronounced the most
brilliant in the Civil War.It was truly Napoleonic in conception and
execution.Grant knew that his base of supplies at Grand Gulf would be cut
off by Pemberton as soon as he moved away from it.He decided, therefore,
against the advice of his generals, to abandon his base altogether.With a few days'
rations in their haversacks the troops were to make a dash that would
possibly take several weeks into the heart of a hostile country.When General Halleck heard of Grant's daring
scheme he wired the latter from Washington, ordering him to move his army
down the river and cooperate with Banks.Fortunately, this order was
received too late to interfere with Grant's plans.As soon as Sherman's divisions joined the main army the march was begun,
on May 7th.An advance of this character must be made with the greatest
celerity and Grant's army showed amazing speed.McPherson, who commanded
the right wing, proceeded toward Jackson by way of Raymond and at the
latter place encountered five thousand Confederates, on May 12th, who
blocked his way and were prepared for fight.McPherson was completely successful and the Confederates
hastened to join their comrades in Jackson.He moved on toward Jackson, and as the last of his
command left Raymond the advance of Sherman's corps reached it.That
night, May 13th, Grant ordered McPherson and Sherman to march upon Jackson
next morning by different roads, while McClernand was held in the rear
near enough to reenforce either in case of need.The rain fell in torrents
that night and, as Grant reported, in places the water was a foot deep in
the road.At eleven o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, a concerted attack was made on the capital of
Mississippi.A few hours' brisk fighting concluded this act of the drama,
and the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on the State capitol.Among the
spoils were seventeen heavy guns.Daniel went to the office.That night, Grant slept in the house
which Johnston had occupied the night before.Meantime, Johnston had ordered Pemberton to detain Grant by attacking him
in the rear.But Pemberton considered it more advisable to move toward
Grand Gulf to separate Grant from his base of supplies, not knowing that
Grant had abandoned his base.And now, with Johnston's army scattered,
Grant left Sherman to burn bridges and military factories, and to tear up
the railroads about Jackson while he turned fiercely on Pemberton.McPherson's corps took the lead.Grant called on McClernand to follow
without delay.Then, hearing that Pemberton was marching toward him, he
called on Sherman to hasten from Jackson.At Champion's Hill (Baker's
Creek) Pemberton stood in the way, with eighteen thousand men.The battle was soon in progress--the heaviest of the campaign.It
continued for seven or eight hours.The Confederates were defeated with a
loss of nearly all their artillery and about half their force, including
four thousand men who were cut off from the main army and failed to rejoin
it.On the banks of the Big Black River, a few miles westward, the
Confederates made another stand, and here the fifth battle of the
investment of Vicksburg took place.The
Confederates suffered heavy losses and the remainder hastened to the
defenses of Vicksburg.They had set fire to the bridge across the Big
Black, and Grant's army was detained for a day--until the Confederates
were safely lodged in the city.The Federal army now invested Vicksburg, occupying the surrounding hills.It was May 18th when the remarkable campaign to reach Vicksburg came to an
end.In eighteen days, the army had marched one hundred and eighty miles
through a hostile country, fought and won five battles, captured a State
capital, had taken twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty field-pieces, and
had slain or wounded six thousand men and captured as many more.As Grant
and Sherman rode out on the hill north of the city, the latter broke into
enthusiastic admiration of his chief, declaring that up to that moment he
had felt no assurance of success, and pronouncing the campaign one of the
greatest in history.The great problem of investing Vicksburg was solved at last.Around the
doomed city gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union army.The
inhabitants and the army that had fled to it as a city of refuge were
penned in.But the Confederacy was not to yield without a stubborn
resistance.On May 19th, an advance was made on the works and the
besieging lines drew nearer and tightened their coils.Three days later,
on May 22nd, Grant ordered a grand assault by his whole army.The troops,
flushed with their victories of the past three weeks, were eager for the
attack.All the corps commanders set their watches by Grant's in order to
begin the assault at all points at the same moment--ten o'clock in the
morning.At the appointed time, the cannon from the encircling lines burst
forth in a deafening roar.Then came the answering thunders from the
mortar-boats on the Louisiana shore and from the gunboats anchored beneath
the bluff.The gunboats' fire was answered from within the bastions
protecting the city.The opening of the heavy guns on the land side was
followed by the sharper crackle of musketry--thousands of shots,
indistinguishable in a continuous roll.The men in the Federal lines leaped from their hiding places and ran to
the parapets in the face of a murderous fire from the defenders of the
city, only to be mowed down by hundreds.Others came, crawling over the
bodies of their fallen comrades--now and then they planted their colors on
the battlements of the besieged city, to be cut down by the galling
Confederate fire.Thus it continued hour after hour, until the coming of
darkness.The Union loss was about three thousand
brave men; the Confederate loss was probably not much over five hundred.Grant had made a fearful sacrifice; he was paying a high price but he had
a reason for so doing--Johnston with a reenforcing army was threatening
him in the rear; by taking Vicksburg at this time he could have turned on
Johnston, and could have saved the Government sending any more Federal
troops; and, to use his own words, it was needed because the men "would
not have worked in the trenches with the same zeal, believing it
unnecessary, as they did after their failure, to carry the enemy's works."On the north side of the city overlooking the river, were the powerful
batteries on Fort Hill, a deadly menace to the Federal troops, and Grant
and Sherman believed that if enfiladed by the gunboats this position could
be carried.At their request Admiral Porter sent the _Cincinnati_ on May
27th to engage the Confederate guns, while four vessels below the town did
the same to the lower defenses.In half an hour five of the
_Cincinnati's_ guns were disabled; and she was in a sinking condition.She
was run toward the shore and sank in three fathoms of water.The army now settled down to a wearisome siege.For six weeks, they
encircled the city with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer to the
defending walls; they exploded mines; they shot at every head that
appeared above the parapets.One by one the defending batteries were
silenced.The sappers slowly worked their way toward the Confederate
ramparts.Miners were busy on both sides burrowing beneath the
fortifications.At three o'clock on the afternoon of June 25th a redoubt
in the Confederate works was blown into the air, breaking into millions of
fragments and disclosing guns, men, and timber.With the mine explosion,
the Federal soldiers before the redoubt began to dash into the opening,
only to meet with a withering fire from an interior parapet which the
Confederates had constructed in anticipation of this event.The carnage
was appalling to behold; and when the soldiers of the Union finally
retired they had learned a costly lesson which withheld them from attack
when another mine was exploded on July 1st.Meantime, let us take a view of the river below and the life of the people
within the doomed city.Far down the river, two hundred and fifty miles
from Vicksburg, was Port Hudson.The place was fortified and held by a
Confederate force under General Gardner.Like Vicksburg, it was besieged
by a Federal army, under Nathaniel P. Banks, of Cedar Mountain fame.On
May 27th, he made a desperate attack on the works and was powerfully aided
by Farragut with his fleet in the river.But aside from dismounting a few
guns and weakening the foe at a still heavier cost to their own ranks, the
Federals were unsuccessful.Again, on June 10th, and still again on the
14th, Banks made fruitless attempts to carry Port Hudson by storm.He
then, like Grant at Vicksburg, settled down to a siege.The defenders of
Port Hudson proved their courage by enduring every hardship.At Vicksburg, during the whole six weeks of the siege, the men in the
trenches worked steadily, advancing the coils about the city.Grant
received reenforcement and before the end of the siege his army numbered
over seventy thousand.Day and night, the roar of artillery continued.From the mortars across the river and from Porter's fleet the shrieking
shells rose in grand parabolic curves, bursting in midair or in the
streets of the city, spreading havoc in all directions.The people of the
city burrowed into the ground for safety.Many whole families lived in
these dismal abodes, their walls of clay being shaken by the roaring
battles that raged above the ground.In one of these dens, sixty-five
people found a home.The food supply ran low, and day by day it became
scarcer.At last, by the end of June, there was nothing to eat except mule
meat and a kind of bread made of beans and corn meal.It was ten o'clock in the morning of July 3d.White flags were seen above
the parapet.A strange quietness rested over the scene
of the long bombardment.On the afternoon of that day, the one, too, on
which was heard the last shot on the battlefield of Gettysburg, Grant and
Pemberton stood beneath an oak tree, in front of McPherson's corps, and
opened negotiations for the capitulation.On the following morning, the
Nation's birthday, about thirty thousand soldiers laid down their arms as
prisoners of war and were released on parole.The losses from May 1st to
the surrender were about ten thousand on each side.Three days later, at Port Hudson, a tremendous cheer arose from the
besieging army.The Confederates within the defenses were at a loss to
know the cause.Then some one shouted the news, "Vicksburg has
surrendered!"Port Hudson could not hope to stand alone; the greater
fortress had fallen.Two days later, July 9th, the gallant garrison, worn
and weary with the long siege, surrendered to General Banks.The whole
course of the mighty Mississippi was now under the Stars and Stripes.[Illustration: BEFORE VICKSBURG]

The close-set mouth, squared shoulders and lowering brow in this
photograph of Grant, taken in December, 1862, tell the story of the
intensity of his purpose while he was advancing upon Vicksburg--only to be
foiled by Van Dorn's raid on his line of communications at Holly Springs.His grim expression and determined jaw betokened no respite for the
Confederates, however.Six months later he marched into the coveted
stronghold.This photograph was taken by James Mullen at Oxford,
Mississippi, in December, 1862, just before Van Dorn's raid balked the
general's plans.[Illustration: AFTER VICKSBURG]

This photograph was taken in the fall of 1863, after the capture of the
Confederacy's Gibraltar had raised Grant to secure and everlasting fame.His attitude is relaxed and his eyebrows no longer mark a straight line
across the grim visage.The right brow is slightly arched with an almost
jovial expression.But the jaw is no less vigorous and determined, and the
steadfast eyes seem to be peering into that future which holds more
victories.He still has Chattanooga and his great campaigns in the East to
fight and the final magnificent struggle in the trenches at Petersburg.[Illustration: WHERE GRANT'S CAMPAIGN WAS HALTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The second attempt to capture
Vicksburg originated with Grant.Since he had sprung into fame at Fort
Donelson early in 1862, he had done little to strengthen his reputation;
but to all urgings of his removal Lincoln replied: "I can't spare this
man; he fights."He proposed to push southward through Mississippi to
seize Jackson, the capital.If this could be accomplished, Vicksburg
(fifty miles to the west) would become untenable.At Washington his plan
was overruled to the extent of dividing his forces.Sherman, with a
separate expedition, was to move from Memphis down the Mississippi
directly against Vicksburg.It was Grant's hope that by marching on he
could unite with Sherman in an assault upon this key to the Mississippi.Pushing forward from Grand Junction, sixty miles, Grant reached Oxford
December 5, 1862, but his supplies were still drawn from Columbus,
Kentucky, over a single-track road to Holly Springs, and thence by wagon
over roads which were rapidly becoming impassable.Delay ensued in which
Van Dorn destroyed Federal stores at Holly Springs worth $1,500,000.This
put an end to Grant's advance.In the picture we see an Illinois regiment
guarding some of the 1200 Confederate prisoners taken during the advance
and here confined in the Courthouse.[Illustration: WHERE VICKSBURG'S FATE WAS SEALED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on May 16, 1863, Grant crowned
his daring maneuver against Vicksburg from the south with complete
success.Once across the river below Grand Gulf, after an easy victory at
Port Gibson, he was joined by Sherman.The army struck out across the
strange country south of the Big Black River and soon had driven
Pemberton's southern outposts across that stream.Grant was now on solid
ground; he had successfully turned the flank of the Confederates and he
grasped the opportunity to strike a telling blow.Pressing forward to
Raymond and Jackson, he captured both, and swept westward to meet the
astounded Pemberton, still vacillating between attempting a junction with
Johnston or attacking Grant in the rear.But Grant, moving with wonderful
precision, prevented either movement.On May 16th a battle ensued which
was most decisive around Champion's Hill.Pemberton was routed and put to
flight, and on the next day the Federals seized the crossings of the Big
Black River.Spiking their guns at Haynes' Bluff, the Confederates retired
into Vicksburg, never to come out again except as prisoners.In eighteen
days from the time he crossed the Mississippi, Grant had gained the
advantage for which the Federals had striven for more than a year at
Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THE CONFEDERATES BURNED AT BIG BLACK RIVER

men fled with precipitate haste over the dreary swamp to the river and
crossed over and burned the railroad and other bridges just in time to
prevent McClernand from following.The necessary delay was aggravating to
Grant's forces.The rest of the day and night was consumed in building
bridges.Sherman had the only pontoon-train with the army and his bridge
was the first ready at Bridgeport, early in the evening.[Illustration: Vicksburg, taken under fire.COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE GATE TO THE MISSISSIPPI

The handwriting is that of Surgeon Bixby, of the Union hospital ship "Red
Rover."In his album he pasted this unique photograph from the western
shore of the river where the Federal guns and mortars threw a thousand
shells into Vicksburg during the siege.The prominent building is the
courthouse, the chief landmark during the investment.Here at Vicksburg
the Confederates were making their last brave stand for the possession of
the Mississippi River, that great artery of traffic.If it were wrested
from them the main source of their supplies would be cut off.Pemberton, a
brave and capable officer and a Pennsylvanian by birth, worked
unremittingly for the cause he had espoused.Warned by the early attacks
of General Williams and Admiral Farragut, he had left no stone unturned to
render Vicksburg strongly defended.It had proved impregnable to attack on
the north and east, and the powerful batteries planted on the river-front
could not be silenced by the fleet nor by the guns of the Federals on the
opposite shore.But Grant's masterful maneuver of cutting loose from his
base and advancing from the south had at last out-generaled both Pemberton
and Johnston.Nevertheless, Pemberton stoutly held his defenses.His high
river-battery is photographed below, as it frowned upon the Federals
opposite.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED CITADEL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Behind these fortifications Pemberton, driven from the Big Black River,
gathered his twenty-one thousand troops to make the last stand for the
saving of the Mississippi to the Confederacy.In the upper picture we see
Fort Castle, one of the strongest defenses of the Confederacy.It had full
sweep of the river; here "Whistling Dick" (one of the most powerful guns
in possession of the South) did deadly work.In the lower picture we see
the fortifications to the east of the town, before which Grant's army was
now entrenching.When Vicksburg had first been threatened in 1862, the
Confederate fortifications had been laid out and work begun on them in
haste with but five hundred spades, many of the soldiers delving with
their bayonets.The sites were so well chosen and the work so well done
that they had withstood attacks for a year.They were to hold out still
longer.By May 18th the Federals had completely invested Vicksburg, and
Grant and Sherman rode out to Haynes' Bluff to view the open river to the
north, down which abundant supplies were now coming for the army.Sherman,
who had not believed that the plan could succeed, frankly acknowledged his
mistake.Sherman, assaulting the
fortifications of Vicksburg, the next day, was repulsed.A second attack,
on the 22d, failed and on the 25th Grant settled down to starve Pemberton
out.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE BESIEGERS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Battery Sherman, on the Jackson Road, before Vicksburg.Settling down to a
siege did not mean idleness for Grant's army.Fortifications had to be
opposed to the formidable one of the Confederates and a constant
bombardment kept up to silence their guns, one by one.It was to be a
drawn-out duel in which Pemberton, hoping for the long-delayed relief from
Johnston, held out bravely against starvation and even mutiny.For twelve
miles the Federal lines stretched around Vicksburg, investing it to the
river bank, north and south.More than eighty-nine battery positions were
constructed by the Federals.Battery Sherman was exceptionally well
built--not merely revetted with rails or cotton-bales and floored with
rough timber, as lack of proper material often made necessary.Gradually
the lines were drawn closer and closer as the Federals moved up their guns
to silence the works that they had failed to take in May.At the time of
the surrender Grant had more than 220 guns in position, mostly of heavy
caliber.By the 1st of July besieged and besiegers faced each other at a
distance of half-pistol shot.Starving and ravaged by disease, the
Confederates had repelled repeated attacks which depleted their forces,
while Grant, reenforced to three times their number, was showered with
supplies and ammunition that he might bring about the long-delayed victory
which the North had been eagerly awaiting since Chancellorsville.[Illustration: INVESTING BY INCHES

sapping and mining, which finally resulted in the wrecking of the fort so
gallantly defended by the veterans of the Third Louisiana.As the Federal
lines crept up, the men working night and day were forced to live in
burrows.They became proficient in such gopher work as the picture shows.Up to the "White House" (Shirley's) the troops could be marched in
comparative safety, but a short distance beyond they were exposed to the
Confederate sharpshooters, who had only rifles and muskets to depend on;
their artillery had long since been silenced.Near this house was
constructed "Coonskin's" Tower; it was built of railway iron and
cross-ties under the direction of Second Lieutenant Henry C. Foster, of
Company B, Twenty-third Indiana.A backwoodsman and dead-shot, he was
particularly active in paying the Confederate sharpshooters in their own
coin.He habitually wore a cap of raccoon fur, which gave him his nickname
and christened the tower, from which the interior of the Confederate works
could be seen.[Illustration: THE FIRST MONUMENT AT THE MEETING PLACE]

Independence Day, 1863, was a memorable anniversary of the nation's birth;
it brought to the anxious North the momentous news that Meade had won at
Gettysburg and that Vicksburg had fallen in the West.The marble shaft in
the picture was erected to mark the spot where Grant and Pemberton met on
July 3d to confer about the surrender.Under a tree, within a few hundred
feet of the Confederate lines, Grant greeted his adversary as an old
acquaintance.They had fought in the same division for a time in the
Mexican War.Each spoke but two sentences as to the surrender, for Grant
lived up to the nickname he gained at Donelson, and Pemberton's pride was
hurt.The former comrades walked and talked awhile on other things, and
then returned to their lines.Next day the final terms were arranged by
correspondence, and the Confederates marched out with colors flying; they
stacked their arms and, laying their colors upon them, marched back into
the city to be paroled.Those who signed the papers not to fight until
exchanged numbered 29,391.The tree where the commanders met was soon
carried away, root and branch, by relic-hunters.Subsequently the monument
which replaced it was chipped gradually into bits, and in 1866 a
64-pounder cannon took its place as a permanent memorial.[Illustration: VICKSBURG IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERALS

squadron, Lieutenant-Commander Le Roy Fitch, with a few small gunboats,
was actively patrolling the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.It was soon
seen that the hold upon Tennessee and Kentucky gained by the Federals by
the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson would be lost without adequate
assistance from the navy, and Admiral Porter was authorized to purchase
small light-draft river steamers and add them to Fitch's flotilla as
rapidly as they could be converted into gunboats.One of the first to be
completed was the "Silver Lake."The little stern-wheel steamer first
distinguished herself on February 3, 1863, at Dover, Tennessee, where she
(with Fitch's flotilla) assisted in routing 4,500 Confederates, who were
attacking the Federals at that place.The little vessel continued to
render yeoman's service with the other gunboats, ably assisted by General
A. W. Ellet's marine brigade.[Illustration]

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The Levee at Vicksburg, February, 1864.For seven months the Federals had
been in possession of the city, and the Mississippi--now open through its
entire course--cut off the struggling Confederacy in the East from the
South and Southwest, the storehouses of their resources and their main
dependence in continuing the struggle.But even such a blow as this,
coming on top of Gettysburg, did not force the brave people of the South
to give up the struggle.In the picture the only remaining warlike signs
are the tents on the opposite shore.But on both sides of the river the
Confederates were still desperately striving to reunite their territory.In the East another year and more of the hardest kind of fighting was
ahead; another severing in twain of the South was inevitable before peace
could come, and before the muskets could be used to shoot the crows, and
before their horses could plough the neglected fields.WITHIN THE PARAPET AT PORT HUDSON IN THE SUMMER OF 1863

These fortifications withstood every attack of Banks' powerful army from
May 24 to July 9, 1863.Like Vicksburg, Port Hudson could be reduced only
by a weary siege.These pictures, taken within the fortifications, show in
the distance the ground over which the investing army approached to the
two unsuccessful grand assaults they made upon the Confederate defenders.A continuous line of parapet,
equally strong, had been thrown up for the defense of Port Hudson,
surrounding the town for a distance of three miles and more, each end
terminating on the riverbank.Four powerful forts were located at the
salients, and the line throughout was defended by thirty pieces of field
artillery.Brigadier-General Beall, who commanded the post in 1862,
constructed these works.Major-General Frank Gardner succeeded him in
command at the close of the year.[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED WORKS]

[Illustration: CONFEDERATE FORTIFICATIONS BEFORE PORT HUDSON]

Gardner was behind these defenses with a garrison of about seven thousand
when Banks approached Port Hudson for the second time on May 24th.Gardner
was under orders to evacuate the place and join his force to that of
Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi, but the courier who brought the order
arrived at the very hour when Banks began to bottle up the Confederates.On the morning of May 25th Banks drove in the Confederate skirmishers and
outposts and, with an army of thirty thousand, invested the fortifications
from the eastward.At 10 A.M., after an artillery duel of more than four
hours, the Federals advanced to the assault of the works.Fighting in a
dense forest of magnolias, amid thick undergrowth and among ravines choked
with felled timber, the progress of the troops was too slow for a telling
attack.The battle has been described as "a gigantic bushwhack."The
Federals at the center reached the ditch in front of the Confederate works
but were driven off.It had cost
Banks nearly two thousand men.[Illustration: THE GUN THAT FOOLED THE FEDERALS]

A "Quaker gun" that was mounted by the Confederates in the fortifications
on the bluff at the river-front before Port Hudson.This gun was hewn out
of a pine log and mounted on a carriage, and a black ring was painted
around the end facing the river.Throughout the siege it was mistaken by
the Federals for a piece of real ordnance.To such devices as this the
beleaguered garrison was compelled constantly to resort in order to
impress the superior forces investing Port Hudson with the idea that the
position they sought to capture was formidably defended.Port Hudson was not again attacked from the river after the
passing of Farragut's two ships.[Illustration: WITHIN "THE CITADEL"

In the fight with the batteries at Port Hudson, March 14, 1863, Farragut,
in the "Hartford" lashed to the "Albatross," got by, but the fine old
consort of the "Hartford," the "Mississippi," went down--her gunners
fighting to the last.Farragut, in anguish, could see her enveloped in
flames lighting up the river.She had grounded under the very guns of a
battery, and not until actually driven off by the flames did her men
leave her.When the "Mississippi" grounded, the shock threw her
lieutenant-commander into the river, and in confusion he swam toward the
shore; then, turning about, he swam back to his ship.Captain Smith thus
writes in his report: "I consider that I should be neglecting a most
important duty should I omit to mention the coolness of my executive
officer, Mr.Dewey, and the steady, fearless, and gallant manner in which
the officers and men of the 'Mississippi' defended her, and the orderly
and quiet manner in which she was abandoned after being thirty-five
minutes aground under the fire of the enemy's batteries.There was no
confusion in embarking the crew, and the only noise was from the enemy's
cannon."Lieutenant-Commander George Dewey, here mentioned at the age of
26, was to exemplify in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the lessons he was
learning from Farragut.[Illustration]

DURING THE FAMOUS ADDRESS IN DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY

The most important American address is brief: "Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a
great battlefield of that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract.The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us;--that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion;--that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG--THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF THE CIVIL WAR


The military operations of the American Civil War were carried on for the
most part south of the Mason and Dixon line; but the greatest and most
famous of the battles was fought on the soil of the old Keystone State,
which had given birth to the Declaration of Independence and to the
Constitution of the United States.Gettysburg is a quiet hamlet, nestling among the hills of Adams County,
and in 1863 contained about fifteen hundred inhabitants.It had been
founded in 1780 by James Gettys, who probably never dreamed that his name
thus given to the village would, through apparently accidental
circumstances, become famous in history for all time.The hills immediately around Gettysburg are not rugged or precipitous;
they are little more than gentle swells of ground, and many of them were
covered with timber when the hosts of the North and the legions of the
South fought out the destiny of the American republic on those memorable
July days in 1863.Lee's army was flushed with victory after Chancellorsville and was
strengthened by the memory of Fredericksburg.Southern hopes were high
after Hooker's defeat on the Rappahannock, in May, 1863, and public
opinion was unanimous in demanding an invasion of Northern soil.On the
other hand, the Army of the Potomac, under its several leaders, had met
with continual discouragement, and, with all its patriotism and valor, its
two years' warfare showed but few bright pages to cheer the heart of the
war-broken soldier, and to inspire the hopes of the anxious public in the
North.Leaving General Stuart with ten thousand cavalry and a part of Hill's
corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing, Lee crossed the Potomac early in
June, 1863, concentrated his army at Hagerstown, Maryland, and prepared
for a campaign in Pennsylvania, with Harrisburg as the objective.His army
was organized in three corps, under the respective commands of Longstreet,
Ewell, and A. P. Hill.Lee had divided his army so as to approach
Harrisburg by different routes and to assess the towns along the way for
large sums of money.Late in June, he was startled by the intelligence
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker, and that the Federals had crossed
the Potomac and were in hot pursuit.Lee was quick to see that his plans must be changed.He knew that to
continue his march he must keep his army together to watch his pursuing
antagonist, and that such a course in this hostile country would mean
starvation, while the willing hands of the surrounding populace would
minister to the wants of his foe.Again, if he should scatter his forces
that they might secure the necessary supplies, the parts would be attacked
singly and destroyed.Lee saw, therefore, that he must abandon his
invasion of the North or turn upon his pursuing foe and disable him in
order to continue his march.But that foe was a giant of strength and
courage, more than equal to his own; and the coming together of two such
forces in a mighty death-struggle meant that a great battle must be
fought, a greater battle than this Western world had hitherto known.The Army of the Potomac had again changed leaders, and George Gordon Meade
was now its commander.Hooker, after a dispute with Halleck, resigned his
leadership, and Meade, the strongest of the corps commanders, was
appointed in his place, succeeding him on June 28th.The two great
armies--Union and Confederate--were scattered over portions of Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania.Both were marching northward, along almost
parallel lines.The Confederates were gradually pressing toward the east,
while the Federals were marching along a line eastward of that followed by
the Confederates.The new commander of the Army of the Potomac was keeping
his forces interposed between the legions of Lee and the Federal capital,
and watching for an opportunity to force the Confederates to battle where
the Federals would have the advantage of position.It was plain that they
must soon come together in a gigantic contest; but just where the shock of
battle would take place was yet unknown.Meade had ordered a general
movement toward Harrisburg, and General Buford was sent with four thousand
cavalry to intercept the Confederate advance guard.On the night of June 30th Buford encamped on a low hill, a mile west of
Gettysburg, and here on the following morning the famous battle had its
beginning.On the morning of July 1st the two armies were still scattered, the
extremes being forty miles apart.But General Reynolds, with two corps of
the Union army, was but a few miles away, and was hastening to Gettysburg,
while Longstreet and Hill were approaching from the west.Buford opened
the battle against Heth's division of Hill's corps.Reynolds soon joined
Buford, and three hours before noon the battle was in progress on Seminary
Ridge.Reynolds rode out to his fighting-lines on the ridge, and while
placing his troops, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, he received
a sharpshooter's bullet in the brain.John F. Reynolds, who had been promoted for gallantry at Buena Vista
in the Mexican War, was one of the bravest and ablest generals of the
Union army.No casualty of the war brought more widespread mourning to the
North than the death of Reynolds.But even this calamity could not stay the fury of the battle.By one
o'clock both sides had been greatly reenforced, and the battle-line
extended north of the town from Seminary Ridge to the bank of Rock Creek.Here for hours the roar of the battle was unceasing.About the middle of
the afternoon a breeze lifted the smoke that had enveloped the whole
battle-line in darkness, and revealed the fact that the Federals were
being pressed back toward Gettysburg.General Carl Schurz, who after
Reynolds' death directed the extreme right near Rock Creek, leaving nearly
half of his men dead or wounded on the field, retreated toward Cemetery
Hill, and in passing through the town the Confederates pursued and
captured a large number of the remainder.The left wing, now unable to
hold its position owing to the retreat of the right, was also forced back,
and it, too, took refuge on Cemetery Hill, which had been selected by
General O. O. Howard; and the first day's fight was over.It was several
hours before night, and had the Southerners known of the disorganized
condition of the Union troops, they might have pursued and captured a
large part of the army.Mary went to the hallway.Meade, who was still some miles from the field,
hearing of the death of Reynolds, had sent Hancock to take general command
until he himself should arrive.Hancock had ridden at full speed and arrived on the field between three
and four o'clock in the afternoon.His presence soon brought order out of
chaos.His superb bearing, his air of confidence, his promise of heavy
reenforcements during the night, all tended to inspire confidence and to
renew hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.Had this day ended the
affair at Gettysburg, the usual story of the defeat of the Army of the
Potomac would have gone forth to the world.Only the advance portions of
both armies had been engaged; and yet the battle had been a formidable
one.A great commander had fallen, and the rank
and file had suffered the fearful loss of ten thousand men.Meade reached the scene late in the night, and chose to make this field,
on which the advance of both armies had accidentally met, the place of a
general engagement.Lee had come to the same decision, and both called on
their outlying legions to make all possible speed to Gettysburg.Before
morning, nearly all the troops of both armies had reached the field.The
Union army rested with its center on Cemetery Ridge, with its right thrown
around to Culp's Hill and its left extended southward toward the rocky
peak called Round Top.The Confederate army, with its center on Seminary
Ridge, its wings extending from beyond Rock Creek on the north to a point
opposite Round Top on the south, lay in a great semi-circle, half
surrounding the Army of the Potomac.First,
"Stonewall" Jackson was gone, and second, Stuart was absent with his ten
thousand cavalry.Furthermore, Meade was on the defensive, and had the
advantage of occupying the inner ring of the huge half circle.Thus lay
the two mighty hosts, awaiting the morning, and the carnage that the day
was to bring.It seemed that the fate of the Republic was here to be
decided, and the people of the North and the South watched with breathless
eagerness for the decision about to be made at Gettysburg.The dawn of July 2d betokened a beautiful summer day in southern
Pennsylvania.The hours of the night had been spent by the two armies in
marshaling of battalions and maneuvering of corps and divisions, getting
into position for the mighty combat of the coming day.But, when morning
dawned, both armies hesitated, as if unwilling to begin the task of
bloodshed.They remained inactive, except for a stray shot here and there,
until nearly four o'clock in the afternoon.The fighting on this second day was chiefly confined to the two extremes,
the centers remaining comparatively inactive.Longstreet commanded the
Confederate right, and opposite him on the Union left was General Daniel
E. Sickles.The Confederate left wing, under Ewell, was opposite Slocum
and the Union right stationed on Culp's Hill.The plan of General Meade had been to have the corps commanded by General
Sickles connect with that of Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops.Sickles found this ground low and disadvantageous as a
fighting-place.In his front he saw the high ground along the ridge on the
side of which the peach orchard was situated, and advanced his men to this
position, placing them along the Emmitsburg road, and back toward the
Trostle farm and the wheat-field, thus forming an angle at the peach
orchard.The left flank of Hancock's line now rested far behind the right
flank of Sickles' forces.The Third Corps was alone in its position in
advance of the Federal line.The Confederate troops later marched along
Sickles' front so that Longstreet's corps overlapped the left wing of the
Union army.The Northerners grimly watched the bristling cannon and the
files of men that faced them across the valley, as they waited for the
battle to commence.The boom of cannon from Longstreet's batteries announced the beginning of
the second day's battle.Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack Sickles in
full force.The fire was quickly answered by the Union troops, and before
long the fight extended from the peach orchard through the wheatfield and
along the whole line to the base of Little Round Top.The musketry
commenced with stray volleys here and there--then more and faster, until
there was one continuous roar, and no ear could distinguish one shot from
another.Longstreet swept forward in a magnificent line of battle, a mile
and a half long.He pressed back the Union infantry, and was seriously
threatening the artillery.At the extreme left, close to the Trostle house, Captain John Bigelow
commanded the Ninth Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery.He was ordered
to hold his position at all hazards until reenforced.With double charges
of grape and canister, again and again he tore great gaps in the advancing
line, but it re-formed and pressed onward until the men in gray reached
the muzzles of the Federal guns.Again Bigelow fired, but the heroic band
had at last to give way to the increased numbers of the attack, which
finally resulted in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Mississippi regiment.Bigelow was wounded, and twenty-eight of his hundred and four men were
left on the bloody field, while he lost sixty-five out of eighty-eight
horses, and four of six guns.Such was one of many deeds of heroism
enacted at Gettysburg.But the most desperate struggle of the day was the fight for the
possession of Little Round Top.Just before the action began General Meade
sent his chief engineer, General G. K. Warren, to examine conditions on
the Union left.The battle was raging in the peach orchard when he came to
Little Round Top.It was unoccupied at the time, and Warren quickly saw
the great importance of preventing its occupation by the Confederates, for
the hill was the key to the whole battle-ground west and south of Cemetery
Ridge.Before long, the engineer saw Hood's division of Longstreet's corps
moving steadily toward the hill, evidently determined to occupy it.Had
Hood succeeded, the result would have been most disastrous to the Union
army, for the Confederates could then have subjected the entire Union
lines on the western edge of Cemetery Ridge to an enfilading fire.Warren
and a signal officer seized flags and waved them, to deceive the
Confederates as to the occupation of the height.Sykes' corps, marching to
the support of the left, soon came along, and Warren, dashing down the
side of the hill to meet it, caused the brigade under Colonel Vincent and
a part of that under General Weed to be detached, and these occupied the
coveted position.Hazlett's battery was dragged by hand up the rugged
<DW72> and planted on the summit.Meantime Hood's forces had come up the hill, and were striving at the very
summit; and now occurred one of the most desperate hand-to-hand conflicts
of the war--in which men forgot that they were human and tore at each
other like wild beasts.The opposing forces, not having time to reload,
charged each other with bayonets--men assaulted each other with clubbed
muskets--the Blue and the Gray grappled in mortal combat and fell dead,
side by side.The privates in the front ranks fought their way onward
until they fell, the officers sprang forward, seized the muskets from the
hands of the dying and the dead, and continued the combat.The furious
struggle continued for half an hour, when Hood's forces gave way and were
pressed down the hillside.But they rallied and advanced again by way of a
ravine on the left, and finally, after a most valiant charge, were driven
back at the point of the bayonet.Little Round Top was saved to the Union army, but the cost was appalling.The hill was covered with hundreds of the slain.Scores of the Confederate
sharpshooters had taken position among the crevasses in the Devil's Den,
where they could overlook the position on Little Round Top, and their
unerring aim spread death among the Federal officers and gunners.Colonel
O'Rourke and General Vincent were dead.General Weed was dying; and, as
Hazlett was stooping to receive Weed's last message, a sharpshooter's
bullet laid him--dead--across the body of his chief.During this attack, and for some hours thereafter, the battle continued in
the valley below on a grander scale and with demon-like fury.Sickles' whole line was pressed back to the base
of the hill from which it had advanced in the morning.Sickles' leg was
shattered by a shell, necessitating amputation, while scores of his brave
officers, and thousands of his men, lay on the field of battle when the
struggle ceased at nightfall.This valley has been appropriately named the
"Valley of Death."Before the close of this main part of the second day's battle, there was
another clash of arms, fierce but of short duration, at the other extreme
of the line.Lee had ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill
on the north, held by Slocum, who had been weakened by the sending of a
large portion of the Twelfth Corps to the assistance of the left wing.Ewell had three divisions, two of which were commanded by Generals Early
and Johnson.It was nearly sunset when he sent Early to attack Cemetery
Hill.Early was repulsed after an hour's bloody and desperate hand-to-hand
fight, in which muskets and bayonets, rammers, clubs, and stones were
used.Johnson's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful.After a severe
struggle of two or three hours General Greene, who alone of the Twelfth
Corps remained on the right, succeeded, after reenforcement, in driving
the right of Johnson's division away from its entrenchments, but the left
had no difficulty in taking possession of the abandoned works of Geary and
Ruger, now gone to Round Top and Rock Creek to assist the left wing.Thus closed the second day's battle at Gettysburg.The harvest of death
had been frightful.The Union loss during the two days had exceeded twenty
thousand men; the Confederate loss was nearly equal.The Confederate army
had gained an apparent advantage in penetrating the Union breastworks on
Culp's Hill.But the Union lines, except on Culp's Hill, were unbroken.On
the night of July 2d, Lee and his generals held a council of war and
decided to make a grand final assault on Meade's center the following day.His counsel was that
Lee withdraw to the mountains, compel Meade to follow, and then turn and
attack him.But Lee was encouraged by the arrival of Pickett's division
and of Stuart's cavalry, and Longstreet's objections were overruled.Meade
and his corps commanders had met and made a like decision--that there
should be a fight to the death at Gettysburg.That night a brilliant July moon shed its luster upon the ghastly field on
which thousands of men lay, unable to rise.Their last battle was over, and their spirits had fled to the great
Beyond.But there were great numbers, torn and gashed with shot and shell,
who were still alive and calling for water or for the kindly touch of a
helping hand.Here and there in the
moonlight little rescuing parties were seeking out whom they might succor.They carried many to the improvised hospitals, where the surgeons worked
unceasingly and heroically, and many lives were saved.All through the night the Confederates were massing artillery along the
crest of Seminary Ridge.The sound horses were carefully fed and watered,
while those killed or disabled were replaced by others.The ammunition was
replenished and the guns were placed in favorable positions and made ready
for their work of destruction.On the other side, the Federals were diligently laboring in the moonlight,
and ere the coming of the day they had planted batteries on the brow of
the hill above the town as far as Little Round Top.The coming of the
morning revealed the two parallel lines of cannon, a mile apart, which
signified only too well the story of what the day would bring forth.The people of Gettysburg, which lay almost between the armies, were
awakened on that fateful morning--July 3, 1863--by the roar of artillery
from Culp's Hill, around the bend toward Rock Creek.This knoll in the
woods had, as we have seen, been taken by Johnson's men the night before.When Geary and Ruger returned and found their entrenchments occupied by
the Confederates they determined to recapture them in the morning, and
began firing their guns at daybreak.Seven hours of fierce bombardment and
daring charges were required to regain them.Every rod of space was
disputed at the cost of many a brave man's life.At eleven o'clock this
portion of the Twelfth Corps was again in its old position.But the most desperate onset of the three days' battle was yet to
come--Pickett's charge on Cemetery Ridge--preceded by the heaviest
cannonading ever heard on the American continent.With the exception of the contest at Culp's Hill and a cavalry fight east
of Rock Creek, the forenoon of July 3d passed with only an occasional
exchange of shots at irregular intervals.At noon there was a lull, almost
a deep silence, over the whole field.It was the ominous calm that
precedes the storm.At one o'clock signal guns were fired on Seminary
Ridge, and a few moments later there was a terrific outburst from one
hundred and fifty Confederate guns, and the whole crest of the ridge, for
two miles, was a line of flame.The scores of batteries were soon enveloped in smoke, through which the
flashes of burning powder were incessant.The long line of Federal guns withheld their fire for some minutes, when
they burst forth, answering the thunder of those on the opposite hill.An
eye-witness declares that the whole sky seemed filled with screaming
shells, whose sharp explosions, as they burst in mid-air, with the
hurtling of the fragments, formed a running accompaniment to the deep,
tremendous roar of the guns.Many of the Confederate shots went wild, passing over the Union army and
plowing up the earth on the other side of Cemetery Ridge.But others were
better aimed and burst among the Federal batteries, in one of which
twenty-seven out of thirty-six horses were killed in ten minutes.The
Confederate fire seemed to be concentrated upon one point between Cemetery
Ridge and Little Round Top, near a clump of scrub oaks.Here the batteries
were demolished and men and horses were slain by scores.The spot has been
called "Bloody Angle."The Federal fire proved equally accurate and the destruction on Seminary
Ridge was appalling.For nearly two hours the hills shook with the
tremendous cannonading, when it gradually slackened and ceased.The Union
army now prepared for the more deadly charge of infantry which it felt was
sure to follow.As the cannon smoke drifted away from between
the lines fifteen thousand of Longstreet's corps emerged in grand columns
from the wooded crest of Seminary Ridge under the command of General
Pickett on the right and General Pettigrew on the left.Longstreet had
planned the attack with a view to passing around Round Top, and gaining it
by flank and reverse attack, but Lee, when he came upon the scene a few
moments after the final orders had been given, directed the advance to be
made straight toward the Federal main position on Cemetery Ridge.The charge was one of the most daring in warfare.The distance to the
Federal lines was a mile.For half the distance the troops marched gayly,
with flying banners and glittering bayonets.Then came the burst of
Federal cannon, and the Confederate ranks were torn with exploding shells.Pettigrew's columns began to waver, but the lines re-formed and marched
on.When they came within musket-range, Hancock's infantry opened a
terrific fire, but the valiant band only quickened its pace and returned
the fire with volley after volley.Pettigrew's troops succumbed to the
storm.For now the lines in blue were fast converging.Federal troops from
all parts of the line now rushed to the aid of those in front of Pickett.The batteries which had been sending shell and solid shot changed their
ammunition, and double charges of grape and canister were hurled into the
column as it bravely pressed into the sea of flame.The Confederates came
close to the Federal lines and paused to close their ranks.Each moment
the fury of the storm from the Federal guns increased."Forward," again rang the command along the line of the Confederate front,
and the Southerners dashed on.The first line of the Federals was driven
back.A stone wall behind them gave protection to the next Federal force.Riflemen rose from behind and hurled a
death-dealing volley into the Confederate ranks.A defiant cheer answered
the volley, and the Southerners placed their battle-flags on the ramparts.General Armistead grasped the flag from the hand of a falling bearer, and
leaped upon the wall, waving it in triumph.Almost instantly he fell
among the Federal troops, mortally wounded.General Garnett, leading his
brigade, fell dead close to the Federal line.General Kemper sank,
wounded, into the arms of one of his men.Troops from all directions rushed upon
him.Clubbed muskets and barrel-staves now became weapons of warfare.The
Confederates began surrendering in masses and Pickett ordered a retreat.Yet the energy of the indomitable Confederates was not spent.Several
supporting brigades moved forward, and only succumbed when they
encountered two regiments of Stannard's Vermont brigade, and the fire of
fresh batteries.As the remnant of the gallant division returned to the works on Seminary
Ridge General Lee rode out to meet them.His
features gave no evidence of his disappointment.With hat in hand he
greeted the men sympathetically."It was all my fault," he said."Now help
me to save that which remains."The
losses of the two armies reached fifty thousand, about half on either
side.More than seven thousand men had fallen dead on the field of battle.The tide could rise no higher; from this point the ebb must begin.Not
only here, but in the West the Southern cause took a downward turn; for at
this very hour of Pickett's charge, Grant and Pemberton, a thousand miles
away, stood under an oak tree on the heights above the Mississippi and
arranged for the surrender of Vicksburg.Lee could do nothing but lead his army back to Virginia.The Federals
pursued but feebly.The Union victory was not a very decisive one, but,
supported as it was by the fall of Vicksburg, the moral effect on the
nation and on the world was great.It
required but little prophetic vision to foresee that the Republic would
survive the dreadful shock of arms.[Illustration: THE CRISIS BRINGS FORTH THE MAN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Gordon Meade and Staff.Not men, but a man is what
counts in war, said Napoleon; and Lee had proved it true in many a bitter
lesson administered to the Army of the Potomac.At the end of June, 1863,
for the third time in ten months, that army had a new commander.Promptness and caution were equally imperative in that hour.Meade's
fitness for the post was as yet undemonstrated; he had been advanced from
the command of the Fifth Corps three days before the army was to engage in
its greatest battle.Lee must be turned back from Harrisburg and
Philadelphia and kept from striking at Baltimore and Washington, and the
somewhat scattered Army of the Potomac must be concentrated.In the very
first flush of his advancement, Meade exemplified the qualities of sound
generalship that placed his name high on the list of Federal commanders.[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It was with the gravest misgivings that Lee began his invasion of the
North in 1863.He was too wise a general not to realize that a crushing
defeat was possible.Yet, with Vicksburg already doomed, the effort to win
a decisive victory in the East was imperative in its importance.Magnificent was the courage and fortitude of Lee's maneuvering during that
long march which was to end in failure.Hitherto he had made every one of
his veterans count for two of their antagonists, but at Gettysburg the
odds had fallen heavily against him.Jackson, his resourceful ally, was no
more.Longstreet advised strongly against giving battle, but Lee
unwaveringly made the tragic effort which sacrificed more than a third of
his splendid army.[Illustration: HANCOCK, "THE SUPERB"

1st a foam-flecked charger dashed up Cemetery Hill bearing General
Hancock.He had galloped thirteen miles to take command.Apprised of the
loss of Reynolds, his main dependence, Meade knew that only a man of vigor
and judgment could save the situation.He chose wisely, for Hancock was
one of the best all-round soldiers that the Army of the Potomac had
developed.John journeyed to the kitchen.It was he who re-formed the shattered corps and chose the
position to be held for the decisive struggle.[Illustration: MUTE PLEADERS IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY PATRIOT PUB.There was little time that could be employed by either side in caring for
those who fell upon the fields of the almost uninterrupted fighting at
Gettysburg.On the morning of the 4th, when Lee began to abandon his
position on Seminary Ridge, opposite the Federal right, both sides sent
forth ambulance and burial details to remove the wounded and bury the dead
in the torrential rain then falling.Under cover of the hazy atmosphere,
Lee was getting his whole army in motion to retreat.Many an unfinished
shallow grave, like the one above, had to be left by the Confederates.In
this lower picture some men of the Twenty-fourth Michigan infantry are
lying dead on the field of battle.This regiment--one of the units of the
Iron Brigade--left seven distinct rows of dead as it fell back from
battle-line to battle-line, on the first day.Three-fourths of its members
were struck down.[Illustration: MEN OF THE IRON BRIGADE]


[Illustration: THE FIRST DAY'S TOLL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The lives laid down by the blue-clad soldiers in the first day's fighting
made possible the ultimate victory at Gettysburg.The stubborn resistance
of Buford's cavalry and of the First and Eleventh Corps checked the
Confederate advance for an entire day.The delay was priceless; it enabled
Meade to concentrate his army upon the heights to the south of Gettysburg,
a position which proved impregnable.To a Pennsylvanian, General John F.
Reynolds, falls the credit of the determined stand that was made that day.Commanding the advance of the army, he promptly went to Buford's support,
bringing up his infantry and artillery to hold back the Confederates.[Illustration: McPHERSON'S WOODS]

At the edge of these woods General Reynolds was killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter in the first vigorous contest of the day.The woods lay
between the two roads upon which the Confederates were advancing from the
west, and General Doubleday (in command of the First Corps) was ordered to
take the position so that the columns of the foe could be enfiladed by the
infantry, while contending with the artillery posted on both roads.The
Iron Brigade under General Meredith was ordered to hold the ground at all
hazards.As they charged, the troops shouted: "If we can't hold it, where
will you find the men who can?"On they swept, capturing General Archer
and many of his Confederate brigade that had entered the woods from the
other side.As Archer passed to the rear, Doubleday, who had been his
classmate at West Point, greeted him with "Good morning![Illustration: FEDERAL DEAD AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.All the way from McPherson's Woods back to Cemetery Hill lay the Federal
soldiers, who had contested every foot of that retreat until nightfall.The Confederates were massing so rapidly from the west and north that
there was scant time to bring off the wounded and none for attention to
the dead.There on the field lay the shoes so much needed by the
Confederates, and the grim task of gathering them began.The dead were
stripped of arms, ammunition, caps, and accoutrements as well--in fact, of
everything that would be of the slightest use in enabling Lee's poorly
equipped army to continue the internecine strife.It was one of war's
awful expedients.[Illustration: SEMINARY RIDGE, BEYOND GETTYSBURG]

Along this road the Federals retreated toward Cemetery Hill in the late
afternoon of July 1st.The success of McPherson's Woods was but temporary,
for the Confederates under Hill were coming up in overpowering numbers,
and now Ewell's forces appeared from the north.The first Corps, under
Doubleday, "broken and defeated but not dismayed," fell back, pausing now
and again to fire a volley at the pursuing Confederates.It finally joined
the Eleventh Corps, which had also been driven back to Cemetery Hill.Lee
was on the field in time to watch the retreat of the Federals, and advised
Ewell to follow them up, but Ewell (who had lost 3,000 men) decided upon
discretion.Night fell with the beaten Federals, reinforced by the Twelfth
Corps and part of the Third, facing nearly the whole of Lee's army.[Illustration: IN THE DEVIL'S DEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Upon this wide, steep hill, about five hundred yards due west of Little
Round Top and one hundred feet lower, was a chasm named by the country
folk "the Devil's Den."When the position fell into the hands of the
Confederates at the end of the second day's fighting, it became the
stronghold of their sharpshooters, and well did it fulfill its name.It
was a most dangerous post to occupy, since the Federal batteries on the
Round Top were constantly shelling it in an effort to dislodge the hardy
riflemen, many of whom met the fate of the one in the picture.Their
deadly work continued, however, and many a gallant officer of the Federals
was picked off during the fighting on the afternoon of the second day.General Vincent was one of the first victims; General Weed fell likewise;
and as Lieutenant Hazlett bent over him to catch his last words, a bullet
through the head prostrated that officer lifeless on the body of his
chief.[Illustration: THE UNGUARDED LINK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Little Round Top, the key to the Federal left at Gettysburg, which they
all but lost on the second day--was the scene of hand-to-hand fighting
rarely equaled since long-range weapons were invented.Twice the
Confederates in fierce conflict fought their way near to this summit, but
were repulsed.Had they gained it, they could have planted artillery which
would have enfiladed the left of Meade's line, and Gettysburg might have
been turned into an overwhelming defeat.Beginning at the right, the
Federal line stretched in the form of a fish-hook, with the barb resting
on Culp's Hill, the center at the bend in the hook on Cemetery Hill, and
the left (consisting of General Sickles' Third Corps) forming the shank to
the southward as far as Round Top.On his own responsibility Sickles had
advanced a portion of his line, leaving Little Round Top unprotected.Upon
this advanced line of Sickles, at the Peach Orchard on the Emmitsburg
road, the Confederates fell in an effort to turn what they supposed to be
Meade's left flank.Only the promptness of General Warren, who discovered
the gap and remedied it in time, saved the key.[Illustration: THE HEIGHT OF THE BATTLE-TIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Near this gate to the local cemetery of Gettysburg there stood during the
battle this sign: "All persons found using firearms in these grounds will
be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law."Many a soldier must have
smiled grimly at these words, for this gateway became the key of the
Federal line, the very center of the cruelest use of firearms yet seen on
this continent.On the first day Reynolds saw the value of Cemetery Hill
in case of a retreat.Howard posted his reserves here, and Hancock greatly
strengthened the position.One hundred and fifty Confederate guns were
turned against it that last afternoon.In five minutes every man of the
Federals had been forced to cover; for an hour and a half the shells fell
fast, dealing death and laying waste the summer verdure in the little
graveyard.Up to the very guns of the Federals on Cemetery Hill, Pickett
led his devoted troops.At night of the 3d it was one vast
slaughter-field.On this eminence, where thousands were buried, was
dedicated the soldiers' National Cemetery.[Illustration: PICKETT--THE MARSHALL NEY OF GETTYSBURG]

The Now-or-never Charge of Pickett's Men.When the Confederate artillery
opened at one o'clock on the afternoon of July 3d, Meade and his staff
were driven from their headquarters on Cemetery Ridge.Nothing could live
exposed on that hillside, swept by cannon that were being worked as fast
as human hands could work them.It was the beginning of Lee's last effort
to wrest victory from the odds that were against him.Longstreet, on the
morning of the 3d, had earnestly advised against renewing the battle
against the Gettysburg heights.But Lee saw that in this moment the fate
of the South hung in the balance; that if the Army of Northern Virginia
did not win, it would never again become the aggressor.Pickett's
division, as yet not engaged, was the force Lee designated for the
assault; every man was a Virginian, forming a veritable Tenth Legion in
valor.Auxiliary divisions swelled the charging column to 15,000.In the
middle of the afternoon the Federal guns ceased firing.Twice Pickett asked of Longstreet if he should go
forward."Sir, I shall lead my division
forward," said Pickett at last, and the heavy-hearted Longstreet bowed his
head.As the splendid column swept out of the woods and across the plain
the Federal guns reopened with redoubled fury.For a mile Pickett and his
men kept on, facing a deadly greeting of round shot, canister, and the
bullets of Hancock's resolute infantry.It was magnificent--but every one
of Pickett's brigade commanders went down and their men fell by scores and
hundreds around them.A hundred led by Armistead, waving his cap on his
sword-point, actually broke through and captured a battery, Armistead
falling beside a gun.Longstreet had been right
when he said: "There never was a body of fifteen thousand men who could
make that attack successfully."Before the converging Federals the thinned
ranks of Confederates drifted wearily back toward Seminary Ridge.Victory
for the South was not to be.[Illustration: MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS ON CEMETERY RIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WHERE PICKETT CHARGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The prelude to Pickett's magnificent charge was a sudden deluge of shells
from 150 long-range Confederate guns trained upon Cemetery Ridge.General
Meade and his staff were instantly driven from their headquarters (already
illustrated) and within five minutes the concentrated artillery fire had
swept every unsheltered position on Cemetery Ridge clear of men.In the
woods, a mile and a half distant, Pickett and his men watched the effect
of the bombardment, expecting the order to "Go Forward" up the <DW72>
(shown in the picture).The Federals had instantly opened with their
eighty available guns, and for three hours the most terrific artillery
duel of the war was kept up.Then the Federal fire slackened, as though
the batteries were silenced.The Confederates' artillery ammunition also
was now low.And at
Longstreet's reluctant nod the commander led his 14,000 Virginians across
the plain in their tragic charge up Cemetery Ridge.[Illustration: GENERAL L. A. ARMISTEAD, C. S.In that historic charge was Armistead, who achieved a momentary victory
and met a hero's death.On across the Emmitsburg road came Pickett's
dauntless brigades, coolly closing up the fearful chasms torn in their
ranks by the canister.Up to the fence held by Hays' brigade dashed the
first gray line, only to be swept into confusion by a cruel enfilading
fire.Then the brigades of Armistead and Garnett moved forward, driving
Hays' brigade back through the batteries on the crest.Despite the
death-dealing bolts on all sides, Pickett determined to capture the guns;
and, at the order, Armistead, leaping the fence and waving his cap on his
sword-point, rushed forward, followed by about a hundred of his men.Up to
the very crest they fought the Federals back, and Armistead, shouting,
"Give them the cold steel, boys!"For a moment the
Confederate flag waved triumphantly over the Federal battery.For a brief
interval the fight raged fiercely at close quarters.Armistead was shot
down beside the gun he had taken, and his men were driven back.Pickett,
as he looked around the top of the ridge he had gained, could see his men
fighting all about with clubbed muskets and even flagstaffs against the
troops that were rushing in upon them from all sides.Flesh and blood
could not hold the heights against such terrible odds, and with a heart
full of anguish Pickett ordered a retreat.The despairing Longstreet,
watching from Seminary Ridge, saw through the smoke the shattered remnants
drift sullenly down the <DW72> and knew that Pickett's glorious but costly
charge was ended.[Illustration: THE MAN WHO HELD THE CENTER

man pictured here (booted and in full uniform, before his headquarters
tent to the left of the picture) to meet the shock of Pickett's great
charge.With four Pennsylvania regiments (the Sixty-Ninth, Seventy-First,
Seventy-Second, and One Hundred and Sixth) of Hancock's Second Corps, Webb
was equal to the emergency.Stirred to great deeds by the example of a
patriotic ancestry, he felt that upon his holding his position depended
the outcome of the day.His front had been the focus of the Confederate
artillery fire.Batteries to right and left of his line were practically
silenced.Young Lieutenant Cushing, mortally wounded, fired the last
serviceable gun and fell dead as Pickett's men came on.Cowan's First New
York Battery on the left of Cushing's used canister on the assailants at
less than ten yards.Webb at the head of the Seventy-Second Pennsylvania
fought back the on-rush, posting a line of slightly wounded in his rear.Webb himself fell wounded but his command checked the assault till Hall's
brilliant charge turned the tide at this point.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WITH GENERAL

Point in 1861.As captain of volunteers he served with McClellan on the
Peninsula.In June, 1863, he was made brigadier-general of volunteers and
as the head of a brigade of cavalry distinguished himself at Gettysburg.Later he served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah, won honor at Cedar Creek,
and was brevetted major-general of volunteers on October 19, 1864.Under
Sheridan he participated in the battles of Five Forks, Dinwiddie Court
House, and other important cavalry engagements of Grant's last campaign.[Illustration: SUMTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Searching all history for a parallel, it is impossible to find any
defenses of a beleaguered city that stood so severe a bombardment as did
this bravely defended and never conquered fortress of Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor.It is estimated that about eighty thousand projectiles
were discharged from the fleet and the marsh batteries, and yet
Charleston, with its battered water-front, was not abandoned until all
other Confederate positions along the Atlantic Coast were in Federal hands
and Sherman's triumphant army was sweeping in from the West and South.The
picture shows Sumter from the Confederate Fort Johnson.The powerful
batteries in the foreground played havoc with the Federal fleet whenever
it came down the main ship-channel to engage the forts.Protected by
almost impassable swamps, morasses, and a network of creeks to the
eastward, Fort Johnson held an almost impregnable position; and from its
protection by Cummings' Point, on which was Battery Gregg, the Federal
fleet could not approach nearer than two miles.Could it have been taken
by land assault or reduced by gun-fire, Charleston would have fallen.[Illustration: WHERE SHOT AND SHELL STRUCK SUMTER]

These views show the result of the bombardment from August 17 to 23, 1863.The object was to force the surrender of the fort and thus effect an
entrance into Charleston.The report of Colonel John W. Turner, Federal
chief of artillery runs: "The fire from the breaching batteries upon
Sumter was incessant, and kept up continuously from daylight till dark,
until the evening of the 23d.... The fire upon the gorge had, by the
morning of the 23d, succeeded in destroying every gun upon the parapet of
it.The parapet and ramparts of the gorge were completely demolished for
nearly the entire length of the face, and in places everything was swept
off down to the arches, the _debris_ forming an accessible ramp to the top
of the ruins.Nothing further being gained by a longer fire upon this
face, all the guns were directed this day upon the southeasterly flank,
and continued an incessant fire throughout the day.The demolition of the
fort at the close of the day's firing was complete, so far as its
offensive powers were considered."[Illustration: SOME OF THE 450 SHOT A DAY]

twenty-seventh round by a shell bursting in the muzzle, blowing off about
20 inches of the barrel.After the bursting the gun was "chipped" back
beyond the termination of the fracture and afterwards fired 371 rounds
with as good results as before the injury.At the end of that time the
muzzle began to crack again, rendering the gun entirely useless.[Illustration: TWO PARROTTS IN BATTERY STEVENS

batteries "on the left," as they were designated, were pounding away at
Fort Sumter.[Illustration: IN CHARLESTON AFTER THE BOMBARDMENT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.So long as the Confederate flag flew over the ramparts of Sumter,
Charleston remained the one stronghold of the South that was firmly held.It was lowered for an evacuation, not a
surrender.The story of Charleston's determined resistance did not end in
triumph for the South, but it did leave behind it a sunset glory, in which
the valor and dash of the Federal attack is paralleled by the heroism and
self-sacrifice of the Confederate defense, in spite of wreck and ruin.[Illustration: SCENE OF THE NIGHT ATTACK ON SUMTER, SEPTEMBER 8, 1863]

The lower picture was taken after the war, when relic-hunters had removed
the shells, and a beacon light had been erected where once stood the
parapet.On September 8, 1863, at the very position in these photographs,
the garrison repelled a bold assault with musketry fire alone, causing the
Federals severe loss.The flag of the Confederacy floated triumphantly
over the position during the whole of the long struggle.Every effort of
the Federals to reduce the crumbling ruins into submission was unavailing.It stood the continual bombardment of ironclads until it was nothing but a
mass of brickdust, but still the gallant garrison held it.It is strange
that despite the awful destruction the loss of lives within the fort was
few.For weeks the bombardment, assisted by the guns of the fleet, tore
great chasms in the parapet.Fort Sumter never fell, but was abandoned
only on the approach of Sherman's army.It had withstood continuous
efforts against it for 587 days.From April, 1863, to September of the
same year, the fortress was garrisoned by the First South Carolina
Artillery, enlisted as regulars.Afterward the garrison was made up of
detachments of infantry from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Artillerists also served turns of duty during this period.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: RALLYING THE LINE._Painted by C. D. Graves._

CHICKAMAUGA--THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN THE WEST

    In its dimensions and its murderousness the battle of Chickamauga was
    the greatest battle fought by our Western armies, and one of the
    greatest of modern times.In our Civil War it was exceeded only by
    Gettysburg and the Wilderness; in European history we may compare with
    it such battles as Neerwinden, or Malplaquet, or Waterloo.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The town of Chattanooga, Tennessee, lies in a great bend of the Tennessee
River and within a vast amphitheater of mountains, ranging in a general
southwesterly direction, and traversed at intervals by great depressions
or valleys.These passes form a natural gateway from the mid-Mississippi
valley to the seaboard States.To dislodge the Confederate army under
General Bragg from this natural fortress would remove the last barrier to
the invading Federals, and permit an easy entry upon the plains of
Georgia.The importance of this position was readily apparent to the
Confederate Government, and any approach by the Federal forces toward this
point was almost certain to be met by stubborn resistance.Rosecrans' forward movement from Murfreesboro, in the early summer of
1863, forced Bragg over the Cumberland Mountains and across the Tennessee.The Confederate leader destroyed the railroad bridge at Bridgeport and
entrenched himself in and around Chattanooga.The three Federal corps
under Crittenden, Thomas and McCook crossed the Tennessee without meeting
resistance, and began to endanger Bragg's lines of communication.But on
September 8th, before their moves had been accomplished, Bragg abandoned
his stronghold.Crittenden the next day marched around the north end of
Lookout and entered the town, while Hazen and Wagner crossed over from the
opposite bank of the Tennessee.Rosecrans believed that Bragg was in full retreat toward Rome, Georgia,
and Crittenden, leaving one brigade in Chattanooga, was ordered to pursue.Bragg encouraged his adversary in the belief that he was avoiding an
engagement and sent spies as deserters into the Federal ranks to narrate
the details of his flight.Meanwhile, he was concentrating at Lafayette,
about twenty-five miles south of Chattanooga.Hither General S. B.
Buckner, entirely too weak to cope with Burnside's heavy column
approaching from Kentucky, brought his troops from Knoxville.Breckinridge
and two brigades arrived from Mississippi, while twelve thousand of Lee's
veterans, under Lee's most trusted and illustrious lieutenant, Longstreet,
were hastening from Virginia to add their numbers to Bragg's Army of
Tennessee.The three corps of the Union army, as we have seen, were now separated
over a wide extent of territory by intervening ridges, so intent was
Rosecrans on intercepting the vanished Bragg.But the latter, by no means
vanished, and with his face toward Chattanooga, considered the position of
his antagonist and discovered his own army almost opposite the Federal
center.Crittenden was advancing toward Ringgold, and the remoteness of
Thomas' corps on his right precluded any immediate union of the Federal
forces.Bragg was quick to grasp the opportunity made by Rosecrans' division of
the army in the face of his opponent.He at once perceived the
possibilities of a master-stroke; to crush Thomas' advanced divisions with
an overwhelming force.The attempt failed, owing to a delay in the attack, which permitted the
endangered Baird and Negley to fall back.Bragg then resolved to throw
himself upon Crittenden, who had divided his corps.Polk was ordered to
advance upon that portion of it at Lee and Gordon's Mills, but when Bragg
came to the front September 13th, expecting to witness the annihilation
of the Twenty-first Corps, he found to his bitter disappointment that the
bishop-general had made no move and that Crittenden had reunited his
divisions and was safe on the west bank of the Chickamauga.Thus his
splendid chances of breaking up the Army of the Cumberland were ruined.When Bragg's position became known to Rosecrans, great was his haste to
effect the concentration of his army.Couriers dashed toward Alpine with
orders for McCook to join Thomas with the utmost celerity.The former
started at once, shortly after midnight on the 13th, in response to
Thomas's urgent call.It was a real race of life and death, attended by
the greatest hardships.Ignorant of the roads, McCook submitted his troops
to a most exhausting march, twice up and down the mountain, fifty-seven
miles of the most arduous toil, often dragging artillery up by hand and
letting it down steep declines by means of ropes.But he closed up with
Thomas on the 17th, and the Army of the Cumberland was saved from its
desperate peril.Crittenden's corps now took position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the left
bank of Chickamauga Creek, and the Federal troops were all within
supporting distance.In the Indian tongue Chickamauga means "The River of
Death," a name strangely prophetic of that gigantic conflict soon to be
waged by these hostile forces throughout this beautiful and heretofore
peaceful valley.The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and
Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing
below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward
Lafayette.On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with
Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right.Their strength has been
estimated at fifty-five to sixty-nine thousand men.On the 18th,
Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the
19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the
Chickamauga.The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could
doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to
both sides.It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a
flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus
intervene between it and Chattanooga.The first encounter, at 10 o'clock
in the morning of the 19th, resulted in a Confederate repulse, but fresh
divisions were constantly pushed forward under the deadly fire of the
Federal artillery.The Federals were gradually forced back by the
incessant charge of the Confederates; but assailed and assailant fought
with such great courage and determination that any decided advantage was
withheld from either.Meanwhile, the Federal right was hard pressed by
Hood, commanding Longstreet's corps, and a desperate battle ensued along
the entire line.It seemed, however, more like a struggle between separate
divisions than the clash of two great armies.When night descended the
Federals had been forced back from the creek, but the result had been
indecisive.Disaster to the Union army had been averted by the use of powerful
artillery when the infantry seemed unable to withstand the onslaught.Rosecrans had assumed the defensive, and his troops had so far receded as
to enable the Confederates to form their lines on all the territory fought
over on that day.During the night preparations were made in both camps
for a renewal of the battle on the following morning, which was Sunday.A
fresh disposition of the troops was made by both leaders.Near midnight
General Longstreet arrived on the field, and was once placed in command of
the Confederate left, Polk retaining the right.Not all of Longstreet's
troops arrived in time for the battle, but Bragg's force has been
estimated at fifty-one to seventy-one thousand strong.Thomas was given command of the Union left, with McCook at his right,
while Crittenden's forces occupied the center, but to the rear of both
Thomas and McCook.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks
on the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates
would concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in
an attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to
begin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning
before Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced
upon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not
falter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the
latter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to
urgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to
the aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's
division was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to
retain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being
seriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,
both sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous
day, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had
resisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the
Southern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed
Reynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent
Wood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving
or interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its
position on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was
left almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and
Kershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and
center with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,
Bushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling
event: "The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns
sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields
flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery
and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our
army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and
grape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed
grandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on
the field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'"A moment later, and
Hood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were
driven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his
military genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of
the opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless
ruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of
Federal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave
soldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he
strove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of
several gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing
heroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion
toward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In
this famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon
Thomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all
attempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their
grasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in
great numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas
was looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had
ordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the
right wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward
Chattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the
Confederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in
spite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the
attempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved
quickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left
flank.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon
Granger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly
with his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,
Granger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet
stationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'
flank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but
it was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was
pouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus
describes the help afforded to Thomas: "Steedman, taking a regimental
color, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but
the enemy was broken."The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The
casualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,
were mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon
the assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,
and when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as
the sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a
mighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and
Hindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at
several points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places
the Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the
battlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during
the war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He
was ever afterwards known as "The Rock of Chickamauga."Under the cover of
darkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired
his army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined
Rosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the
forces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The
Union army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to
the Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly
eighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in
the ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The
Confederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,
Hood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,
and yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage
accrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of
Chattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the
Cumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies
exercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective
troops.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the
commanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were
awarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,
which swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was
proclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his
firmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate
forces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest
laurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA

1876.Bragg's name before 1861 was perhaps better known in military annals
than that of any other Southern leader because of his brilliant record in
the Mexican War.In the Civil War he distinguished himself first at Shiloh
and by meritorious services thereafter.But his delays rendered him
scarcely a match for Rosecrans, to say nothing of Grant and Sherman.Flanked out of two strong positions, he missed the opportunity presented
by Rosecrans' widely separated forces and failed to crush the Army of the
Cumberland in detail, as it advanced to the battle of Chickamauga.The
error cost the Confederates the loss of Tennessee, eventually.[Illustration: THOMAS--THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA" WHO BECAME THE "SLEDGE OF

Union; commended for gallantry in the Seminole War, and for service in
Mexico; won the battle of Mill Spring, January 19, 1862; commanded the
right wing of the Army of the Tennessee against Corinth and at Perryville,
and the center at Stone's River.Only his stability averted overwhelming
defeat for the Federals at Chickamauga.At Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge he was a host in himself.After Sherman had taken Atlanta he sent
Thomas back to Tennessee to grapple with Hood.How he crushed Hood by his
sledge-hammer blows is told in the story of "Nashville."Thomas, sitting
down in Nashville, bearing the brunt of Grant's impatience, and ignoring
completely the proddings from Washington to advance before he was ready,
while he waited grimly for the psychological moment to strike the oncoming
Confederate host under Hood, is one of the really big dramatic figures of
the entire war.It has been well said of Thomas that every promotion he
received was a reward of merit; and that during his long and varied career
as a soldier no crisis ever arose too great for his ability.[Illustration: BEFORE CHICKAMAUGA--IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Rarely does the camera afford such a perfectly contemporaneous record of
the march of events so momentous.This photograph shows the hotel at
Stevenson, Alabama, during the Union advance that ended in Chickamauga.Sentinels are parading the street in front of the hotel, several horses
are tied to the hotel posts, and the officers evidently have gone into the
hotel headquarters.General Alexander McDowell McCook, commanding the old
Twentieth Army Corps, took possession of the hotel as temporary
headquarters on the movement of the Army of the Cumberland from Tullahoma.On August 29, 1863, between Stevenson and Caperton's Ferry, on the
Tennessee River, McCook gathered his boats and pontoons, hidden under the
dense foliage of overhanging trees, and when ready for his crossing
suddenly launched them into and across the river.Thence the troops
marched over Sand Mountain and at length into Lookout Valley.During the
movements the army was in extreme peril, for McCook was at one time three
days' march from Thomas, so that Bragg might have annihilated the
divisions in detail.Finally the scattered corps were concentrated along
Chickamauga Creek, where the bloody struggle of September 19th and 20th
was so bravely fought.[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO CHICKAMAUGA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This solitary observer, if he was standing here September 20, 1863,
shortly before this was photographed, certainly gazed at the base of the
hill to the left.For through the pass called Rossville Gap a column in
blue was streaming--Steedman's Division of the Reserve Corps, rushing to
aid Thomas, so sore pressed at Chickamauga.Those <DW72>s by Chickamauga
Creek witnessed the deadliest battle in the West and the highest in
percentage of killed and wounded of the entire war.It was fought as a
result of Rosecrans' attempt to maneuver Bragg out of Chattanooga.The
Federal army crossed the Tennessee River west of the city, passed through
the mountain-ranges, and came upon Bragg's line of communications.Finding
his position untenable, the Southern leader moved southward and fell upon
the united forces of Rosecrans along Chickamauga Creek.The vital point in
the Federal line was the left, held by Thomas.Should that give way, the
army would be cut off from Chattanooga, with no base to fall back on.The
heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation.For a time, the Union army was
driven back.But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground.He
re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into
Chattanooga.Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the
forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late.About noon a break was
made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager
Longstreet promptly hurled his men.Colonel Dodge writes: "Everything
seems lost.The entire right of the army, with Rosecrans and his staff, is
driven from the field in utter rout.But, unknown even to the commanding
general, Thomas, the Rock of Chickamauga, stands there at bay, surrounded,
facing two to one.Heedless of the wreck of one-half the army, he knows
not how to yield."[Illustration: THE TOO-ADVANCED POSITION

in concentrating his troops on the 18th of September, was still possessed
of the idea that Bragg was covering his retreat upon his railroad
connections at Dalton.Instead, the Confederate commander had massed his
forces on the other side of Chickamauga and was only awaiting the arrival
of Longstreet to assume the aggressive.On the morning of the 19th,
McCook's right wing at Crawfish Spring was strongly threatened by the
Confederates, while the real attack was made against the left in an effort
to turn it and cut Rosecrans off from a retreat upon Chattanooga.All day
long, brigade after brigade was marched from the right of the Federal line
in order to extend the left under Thomas and withstand this flanking
movement.Even after nightfall, Thomas, trying to re-form his lines and
carry them still farther to the left for the work of the morrow, brought
on a sharp conflict in the darkness.The Confederates had been held back,
but at heavy cost.That night, at the Widow Glenn's house, Rosecrans
consulted his generals.The exhausted Thomas, when roused from sleep for
his opinion, invariably answered, "I would strengthen the left."There
seemed as yet to be no crisis at hand, and the council closed with a song
by the debonair McCook.[Illustration: WHERE THE LINES WERE SWEPT BACK

Federal line on the second day at Chickamauga.From it, northward, were
posted the commands of McCook and Crittenden, depleted by the detachments
of troops the day before to strengthen the left.All might have gone well
if the main attack of the Confederates had continued to the left, as
Rosecrans expected.But hidden in the woods, almost within a stone's throw
of the Federal right on that misty morning, was the entire corps of
Longstreet, drawn up in columns of brigades at half distance--"a
masterpiece of tactics," giving space for each column to swing right or
left.Seizing a momentous opportunity which would have lasted but thirty
minutes at the most, Longstreet hurled them through a gap which, owing to
a misunderstanding, had been left open, and the entire Federal right was
swept from the field.[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHENCE HELP CAME

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here, at his headquarters, holding the Federal line of retreat at
Rossville Gap (the Confederate objective in the battle), General Gordon
Granger heard with increasing anxiety the sounds of the conflict, three
miles away, growing more and more ominous.Finally, in disobedience of
orders, he set in motion his three brigades to the relief of Thomas,
pushing forward two of them under Steedman.These arrived upon the field
early in the afternoon, the most critical period of the battle, as
Longstreet charged afresh on Thomas' right and rear.Seizing a
battle-flag, Steedman (at the order of General Granger) led his command in
a counter-charge which saved the Army of the Cumberland.This old house at
Rossville was built by John Ross, a chief of the Cherokee Indians, and he

    which supplied it were exhaustless.It was still coming with an ever
    increasing current, swelling higher and growing more resistless.This
    triune disaster [Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Missionary Ridge] was
    especially depressing to the people because it came like a blight upon
    their hopes which had been awakened by recent Confederate
    victories."--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of
    the Civil War."_


Following the defeat of Rosecrans' army at Chickamauga in September 1863
Bragg at once took strong positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout
Mountain.From these heights he was able to besiege the entire Army of the
Cumberland in Chattanooga and obstruct the main arteries of supply to the
Federal troops.Rosecrans was forced to abandon the route along the south
bank of the Tennessee River, which led from Bridgeport, in Alabama, and to
depend exclusively upon a long and mountainous wagon road on the north
side of the river for the transportation of supplies.The Confederate
cavalry, crossing the Tennessee above Chattanooga, fell upon the trains
entangled in the mud of the Sequatchie valley, destroying in one day three
hundred wagons, and killing or capturing about eighteen hundred mules.Within a short time the wisdom of Bragg's plan became apparent; famine
threatened the Union army and several thousand horses and mules had
already died from starvation.By his relentless vigil, the Confederate
leader seemed destined to achieve a greater victory over his opponent than
had hitherto attended his efforts in actual conflict.Meanwhile, a complete reorganization of the Federal forces in the West was
effected.Under the title of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the
Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee were united
with Grant as general commanding, and Rosecrans was replaced by Thomas at
the head of the Army of the Cumberland.A hurried concentration of the Federal forces was now ordered by General
Halleck.Hooker with fifteen thousand men of the Army of the Potomac came
rapidly by rail to Bridgeport.Sherman, with a portion of his army, about
twenty thousand strong, was summoned from Vicksburg and at once embarked
in steamers for Memphis.General Grant decided to assume personal charge
of the Federal forces; but before he reached his new command, Thomas, ably
assisted by his chief engineer, General W. F. Smith, had begun to act on a
plan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a
brilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as
Raccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its
south side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's
Ferry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought
by boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with
Hooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with
a portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive
skirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces
in possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between
Bridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and
the Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements
from all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was
already on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he
arrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville
offered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable
one; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the
line extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to
Missionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments
throughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from
the converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside
and despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to
Knoxville.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued
to hold the same extended position, although his combined force was
smaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost
impassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by
the pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and
was assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of
Chickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty
thousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest
Burnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not
be diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front
of Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but
information reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.He, therefore,
on the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from
the appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance
line of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief
that the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful
pageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate
pickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,
and Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,
between Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was
almost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,
Grant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the
Confederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held
the center, and "Fighting Joe" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout
Valley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to
engage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and
Longstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,
and at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings
assailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce
these positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to
concentrate upon the center.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but
little opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and
promptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The
Confederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill
but were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had
gained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his
operations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above
the surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,
rising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing
troops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing
barrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army
(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's
Ferry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by
Hooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,
crossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the
Confederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across
by bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal
troops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,
invisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's
brigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over
ledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South
with musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.Position after
position was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's
advanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed
from the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a
vantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on
Orchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the
haze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the
clouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's
troops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the
palisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its
higher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley
after volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of
Ireland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin
Point across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the
Craven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices
into Chattanooga Valley.Such was the "battle in the clouds," a wonderful spectacle denied the
remainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,
"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from
the roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley
could catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or
its progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was
revealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which
only soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory."By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley
and the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.Hooker
established and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,
which General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after
midnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not
break the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,
leaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three
brigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to
scale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,
by means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving
Stars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout
Mountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of "Fighting Joe's" valiant
troops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a
distinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain
across Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union
forces maintained an unbroken front.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay
deep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point
almost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the
preparations for the battle.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge
held by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced
rapidly and in full view of the foe.For a time it seemed as if the
Confederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance
was abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when
within a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only
succeeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back
the forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,
and captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was
desperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been
withheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was
sweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the
Confederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further
weaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been
delayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right
he had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns
fired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general
advance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of
the Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the
word to advance.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a
mile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill
could be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland troops in motion when
fifty pieces of artillery on the crest of Missionary Ridge opened a
terrific fire upon them.But the onward rush of the Federals was not
checked in the slightest degree.The line of entrenchments at the base was
carried with little opposition.Most of Breckinridge's men abandoned the
ditches as the Federal skirmishers approached and sought refuge up the
hill, breaking and throwing into confusion other troops as they passed
through.At the foot of Missionary Ridge Thomas' army had reached its goal.But, as General Wood has related, "the
enthusiasm and impetuosity of the troops were such that those who first
reached the entrenchments at the base of the ridge bounded over them and
pressed on up the ascent.... Moreover the entrenchments were no protection
against the artillery on the ridge.To remain would be destruction--to
return would be both expensive in life, and disgraceful.Officers and men,
all seemed impressed with this truth.... Without waiting for an order the
vast mass pressed forward in the race for glory, each man anxious to be
the first on the summit.... Artillery and musketry could not check the
impetuous assault.To have done so would
have been ruinous.Little was left to the commanders of the troops than to
cheer on the foremost--to encourage the weaker of limb and to sustain the
very few who seemed to be faint-hearted."Midway up the <DW72> was a small line of rifle-pits, but these proved of no
use in stemming the Federal tide.In the immediate front, however, Major
Weaver of the Sixtieth North Carolina rallied a sufficient number of the
demoralized Confederates to send a well-directed and effective fire upon
the advancing troops.At this point the first line of oncoming Federals
was vigorously repulsed, and thrown back to the vacated Confederate
trenches.General Bragg, noticing this, rode along the ridge to spread his
good news among the troops, but he had not gone far when word was brought
that the right flank was broken and that the Federal standard had been
seen on the summit.A second and a third flag appeared in quick
succession.Bragg sent General Bate to drive the foe back, but the
disaster was so great that the latter was unable to repair it.Even the
artillery had abandoned the infantry.The Confederate flank had gone, and
within an hour of the start from Orchard Knob the crest of Missionary
Ridge was occupied by Federal troops.He went
down the eastern <DW72>, driving all in front of him toward Chickamauga
Creek.On a more easterly ridge he rested until midnight, when he advanced
to the creek and took many prisoners and stores.While the Army of the Cumberland accomplished these things, Hooker was
advancing his divisions at charging pace from the south.Cruft was on the
crest, Osterhaus in the eastern valley, and Geary in the western--all
within easy supporting distance.Before Cruft's onrush the left wing of
Bragg's army was scattered in all directions from the ridge.Many ran down
the eastern <DW72> into Osterhaus' column and the very few who chose a way
of flight to the west, were captured by Geary.The bulk of them, however,
fell back from trench to trench upon the crest until finally, as the sun
was sinking, they found themselves surrounded by Johnson's division of the
Army of the Cumberland.Such was the fate of Stewart's division; only a
small portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the
left and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was
lost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he
might and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly
defeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place
at Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the
result of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and
ably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight
hundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being
prisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever
wrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED

ground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the
Confederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be
rafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty
rations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the
lines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered
by hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers "could not be got out of their
trenches to assume the offensive."But it was these very men who achieved
the most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING "THE CRACKER LINE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]_Chattanooga_ was the first steamboat built by the Federals
on the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to
come up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance
of Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But
between Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,
making the river impassable.While Bragg's pickets invested the railroad
and river, supplies could not be brought up from Bridgeport; and besides,
with the exception of one small steamboat (the _Dunbar_), the Federals had
no boats on the river.General W. F. Smith, Chief Engineer of the Army of
the Cumberland, had established a saw-mill with an old engine at
Bridgeport for the purpose of getting out lumber from logs rafted down the
river, with which to construct pontoons.Here Captain Arthur Edwards,
Assistant Quartermaster, had been endeavoring since the siege began to
build a steamboat consisting of a flat-bottom scow, with engine, boiler,
and stern-wheel mounted upon it.On October 24th, after many difficulties
and discouragements had been overcome, the vessel was launched
successfully and christened the _Chattanooga_.On the 29th she made her
trial trip.That very night, Hooker, in the battle of Wauhatchie,
definitely established control of the new twelve-mile "Cracker Line" from
Kelley's Ferry, which Grant had ordered for the relief of the starving
army.The next day the little _Chattanooga_, with steam up, was ready to
start from Bridgeport with a heavy load of the much-needed supplies, and
her arrival was anxiously awaited at Kelley's Ferry, where the
wagon-trains were all ready to rush forward the rations and forage to
Chattanooga.The mechanics were still at work upon the little vessel's
unfinished pilot-house and boiler-deck while she and the two barges she
was to tow were being loaded, and at 4 A.M.on November 30th she set out
to make the 45-mile journey against unfavorable head-winds.[Illustration: THE WELCOME NEWCOMER

day, and then was enveloped in one of the darkest of nights, out of which
a blinding rain stung the faces of her anxious crew.Assistant
Quartermaster William G. Le Duc, in command of the expedition, helped the
pilot to feel his way through the darkness.At last the camp-fires of the
Federals became guiding beacons from the shore and soon the _Chattanooga_
tied up safely at Kelley's Ferry.The "Cracker Line" was at last opened in
the nick of time, for there were but four boxes of hard bread left in the
commissary at Chattanooga, where four cakes of hard bread and one-quarter
of a pound of pork were being issued as a three-days' ration.[Illustration: WHERE AN ARMY GAVE ITS OWN ORDERS

Confederates and captured Orchard Knob (or Indian Hill) a day before it
had been planned to do so.Still another surprise awaited Grant on the
25th, when from this eminence he watched the magnificent spectacle of the
battle of Chattanooga.Thomas' men again pressed forward in what was
ordered as a demonstration against Missionary Ridge.Up and over it they

they drove back the Confederates and established the new line of

another.The heavy musketry fire and the boom of the Confederate battery
on the top of the mountain apprised the waiting Federals before
Chattanooga that the battle had begun.Now and again the fitful lifting of
the mist disclosed to Grant and Thomas, watching from Orchard Knob, the
men of Hooker fighting upon the heights.Then all would be curtained once
more.At two o'clock in the afternoon the mist became so heavy that Hooker
and his men could not see what they were doing, and paused to entrench.By
four o'clock, however, he had pushed on to the summit and reported to
Grant that his position was impregnable.Direct communication was then
established and reenforcements sent.[Illustration: THE PEAK OF VICTORY--THE MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE

THE BATTLE IN THE WILDERNESS

    The volunteers who composed the armies of the Potomac and Northern
    Virginia were real soldiers now, inured to war, and desperate in their
    determination to do its work without faltering or failure.This
    fact--this change in the temper and _morale_ of the men on either
    side--had greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to solve.They knew that those men would stand against
    anything, endure slaughter without flinching, hardship without
    complaining, and make desperate endeavor without shrinking.The two
    armies had become what they had not been earlier in the contest,
    _perfect instruments of war_, that could be relied upon as confidently
    as the machinist relies upon his engine scheduled to make so many
    revolutions per minute at a given rate of horse-power, and with the
    precision of science itself.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History
    of the Confederate War."_


After the battle of Gettysburg, Lee started for the Potomac, which he
crossed with some difficulty, but with little interruption from the
Federals, above Harper's Ferry, on July 14, 1863.The thwarted invader of
Pennsylvania wished to get to the plains of Virginia as quickly as
possible, but the Shenandoah was found to be impassable.Meade, in the
mean time, had crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge and seized the
principal outlets from the lower part of the Valley.Lee, therefore, was
compelled to continue his retreat up the Shenandoah until Longstreet, sent
in advance with part of his command, had so blocked the Federal pursuit
that most of the Confederate army was able to emerge through Chester Gap
and move to Culpeper Court House.Ewell marched through Thornton's Gap and
by the 4th of August practically the whole Army of Northern Virginia was
south of the Rapidan, prepared to dispute the crossing of that river.But
Meade, continuing his flank pursuit, halted at Culpeper Court House,
deeming it imprudent to attempt the Rapidan in the face of the strongly
entrenched Confederates.In the entire movement there had been no fighting
except a few cavalry skirmishes and no serious loss on either side.On the 9th of September, Lee sent Longstreet and his corps to assist Bragg
in the great conflict that was seen to be inevitable around Chattanooga.In spite of reduced strength, Lee proceeded to assume a threatening
attitude toward Meade, and in October and early November there were
several small but severe engagements as the Confederate leader attempted
to turn Meade's flank and force him back to the old line of Bull Run.On
the 7th of November, Sedgwick made a brilliant capture of the redoubts on
the Rappahannock, and Lee returned once more to his old position on the
south side of the Rapidan.This lay between Barnett's Ford, near Orange
Court House (Lee's headquarters), and Morton's Ford, twenty miles below.Its right was also protected by entrenchments along the course of Mine
Run.Against these, in the last days of November, Meade sent French,
Sedgwick, and Warren.It was found impossible to carry the Confederate
position, and on December 1st the Federal troops were ordered to recross
the Rapidan.In this short campaign the Union lost sixteen hundred men and
the Confederacy half that number.With the exception of an unsuccessful
cavalry raid against Richmond, in February, nothing disturbed the
existence of the two armies until the coming of Grant.In the early months of 1864, the Army of the Potomac lay between the
Rapidan and the Rappahannock, most of it in the vicinity of Culpeper Court
House, although some of the troops were guarding the railroad to
Washington as far as Bristoe Station, close to Manassas Junction.On the
south side of the Rapidan, the Army of Northern Virginia was, as has been
seen, securely entrenched.The Confederates' ranks were thin and their
supplies were scarce; but the valiant spirit which had characterized the
Southern hosts in former battles still burned fiercely within their
breasts, presaging many desperate battles before the heel of the invader
should tread upon their cherished capital, Richmond, and their loved
cause, the Confederacy.Within the camp religious services had been held for weeks in succession,
resulting in the conversion of large numbers of the soldiers.The influence of the awakening among the men in the
army during this revival was manifest after the war was over, when the
soldiers had gone back to civil life, under conditions most trying and
severe.To this spiritual frame of mind may be credited, perhaps, some of
the remarkable feats accomplished in subsequent battles by the Confederate
army.On February 29, 1864, the United States Congress passed law reviving the
grade of lieutenant-general, the title being intended for Grant, who was
made general-in-chief of the armies of the United States.Grant had come
from his victorious battle-grounds in the West, and all eyes turned to him
as the chieftain who should lead the Union army to success.On the 9th of
March he received his commission.He now planned the final great double
movement of the war.Taking control of the whole campaign against Lee, but
leaving the Army of the Potomac under Meade's direct command, he chose the
strongest of his corps commanders, W. T. Sherman, for the head of affairs
in the West.Grant's immediate objects were to defeat Lee's army and to
capture Richmond, the latter to be accomplished by General Butler and the
Army of the James; Sherman's object was to crush Johnston, to seize that
important railroad center, Atlanta, Georgia, and, with Banks' assistance,
to open a way between the Atlantic coast and Mobile, on the Gulf, thus
dividing the Confederacy north and south, as the conquest of the
Mississippi had parted it east and west.It was believed that if either or
both of these campaigns were successful, the downfall of the Confederacy
would be assured.On a recommendation of General Meade's, the Army of the Potomac was
reorganized into three corps instead of the previous five.The Second,
Fifth, and Sixth corps were retained, absorbing the First and Third.Hancock was in command of the Second; Warren, the Fifth; and Sedgwick, the
Sixth.Sheridan was at the head of the cavalry.The Ninth Corps acted as a
separate army under Burnside, and was now protecting the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad.As soon as Meade had crossed the Rapidan, Burnside
was ordered to move promptly, and he reached the battlefield of the
Wilderness on the morning of May 6th.On May 24th his corps was assigned
to the Army of the Potomac.The Union forces, including the Ninth Corps,
numbered about one hundred and eighteen thousand men.The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three corps of infantry, the
First under Longstreet, the Second under Ewell, and the Third under A. P.
Hill, and a cavalry corps commanded by Stuart.A notable fact in the
organization of the Confederate army was the few changes made in
commanders.The total forces under Lee were about sixty-two thousand.After assuming command, Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper
Court House, whence he visited Washington once a week to consult with
President Lincoln and the Secretary of War.He was given full authority,
however, as to men and movements, and worked out a plan of campaign which
resulted in a series of battles in Virginia unparalleled in history.The
first of these was precipitated in a dense forest, a wilderness, from
which the battle takes its name.Grant decided on a general advance of the Army of the Potomac upon Lee,
and early on the morning of May 4th the movement began by crossing the
Rapidan at several fords below Lee's entrenched position, and moving by
his right flank.The crossing was effected successfully, the line of march
taking part of the Federal troops over a scene of defeat in the previous
spring.One year before, the magnificent Army of the Potomac, just from a
long winter's rest in the encampment at Falmouth on the north bank of the
Rappahannock, had met the legions of the South in deadly combat on the
battlefield of Chancellorsville.And now Grant was leading the same army,
whose ranks had been freshened by new recruits from the North, through the
same field of war.By eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th the various rumors as to the
Federal army's crossing the Rapidan received by Lee were fully confirmed,
and at once he prepared to set his own army in motion for the Wilderness,
and to throw himself across the path of his foe.Two days before he had
gathered his corps and division commanders around him at the signal
station on Clark's Mountain, a considerable eminence south of the Rapidan,
near Robertson's Ford.Here he expressed the opinion that Grant would
cross at the lower fords, as he did, but nevertheless Longstreet was kept
at Gordonsville in case the Federals should move by the Confederate left.The day was oppressively hot, and the troops suffered greatly from thirst
as they plodded along the forest aisles through the jungle-like region.The Wilderness was a maze of trees, underbrush, and ragged foliage.Low-limbed pines, scrub-oaks, hazels, and chinkapins interlaced their
branches on the sides of rough country roads that lead through this
labyrinth of desolation.The weary troops looked upon the heavy tangles of
fallen timber and dense undergrowth with a sense of isolation.Only the
sounds of the birds in the trees, the rustling of the leaves, and the
passing of the army relieved the heavy pall of solitude that bore upon the
senses of the Federal host.The forces of the Northern army advanced into the vast no-man's land by
the roads leading from the fords.In the afternoon, Hancock was resting at
Chancellorsville, while Warren posted his corps near the Wilderness
Tavern, in which General Grant established his headquarters.Sedgwick's
corps had followed in the track of Warren's veterans, but was ordered to
halt near the river crossing, or a little south of it.The cavalry, as
much as was not covering the rear wagon trains, was stationed near
Chancellorsville and the Wilderness Tavern.That night the men from the
North lay in bivouac with little fear of being attacked in this wilderness
of waste, where military maneuvers would be very difficult.Two roads--the old Orange turnpike and the Orange plank road--enter the
Wilderness from the southwest.Along these the Confederates moved from
their entrenched position to oppose the advancing hosts of the North.Ewell took the old turnpike and Hill the plank road.Longstreet was
hastening from Gordonsville.The troops of Longstreet, on the one side,
and of Burnside, on the other, arrived on the field after exhausting
forced marches.The locality in which the Federal army found itself on the 5th of May was
not one that any commander would choose for a battle-ground.Lee was more
familiar with its terrible features than was his opponent, but this gave
him little or no advantage.Grant, having decided to move by the
Confederate right flank, could only hope to pass through the desolate
region and reach more open country before the inevitable clash would come.General Humphreys, who was Meade's chief of staff,
says in his "Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865": "So far as I know, no
great battle ever took place before on such ground.But little of the
combatants could be seen, and its progress was known to the senses chiefly
by the rising and falling sounds of a vast musketry fire that continually
swept along the lines of battle, many miles in length, sounds which at
times approached to the sublime."As Ewell, moving along the old turnpike on the morning of May 5th, came
near the Germanna Ford road, Warren's corps was marching down the latter
on its way to Parker's store, the destination assigned it by the orders of
the day.This meeting precipitated the battle of the Wilderness.Meade learned the position of Ewell's advance division and ordered an
attack.The Confederates were driven back a mile or two, but, re-forming
and reenforced, the tide of battle was turned the other way.Sedgwick's
marching orders were sending him to the Wilderness Tavern on the turnpike.He was on his way when the battle began, and he now turned to the right
from the Germanna Ford road and formed several of his divisions on
Warren's right.The presence of Hill on the plank road became known to
Meade and Grant, about eight in the morning.Hancock, at Chancellorsville,
was too far away to check him, so Getty's division of Sedgwick's corps, on
its way to the right, was sent over the Brock road to its junction with
the plank road for the purpose of driving Hill back, if possible, beyond
Parker's store.Warren and Sedgwick began to entrench themselves when they realized that
Ewell had effectively blocked their progress.Getty, at the junction of
the Brock and the Orange plank roads, was likewise throwing up breastworks
as fast as he could.Hancock, coming down the Brock road from
Chancellorsville, reached him at two in the afternoon and found two of A.
P. Hill's divisions in front.After waiting to finish his breastworks,
Getty, a little after four o'clock, started, with Hancock supporting him,
to carry out his orders to drive Hill back.Hancock says: "The fighting
became very fierce at once.The lines of battle were exceedingly close,
the musketry continuous and deadly along the entire line.... The battle
raged with great severity and obstinacy until about 8 P.M.Here, on the Federal left, and in this
desperate engagement, General Alexander Hays, one of Hancock's brigade
commanders, was shot through the head and killed.The afternoon had worn away with heavy skirmishing on the right.About
five o'clock Meade made another attempt on Ewell's forces.Both lines were
well entrenched, but the Confederate artillery enfiladed the Federal
positions.It was after dark when General Seymour of Sedgwick's corps
finally withdrew his brigade, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.When the battle roar had ceased, the rank and file of the Confederate
soldiers learned with sorrow of the death of one of the most dashing
brigade leaders in Ewell's corps, General John M. Jones.This fighting was
the preliminary struggle for position in the formation of the battle-lines
of the two armies, to secure the final hold for the death grapple.The
contestants were without advantage on either side when the sanguinary
day's work was finished.Both armies had constructed breastworks and were entrenched very close to
each other, front to front, gathered and poised for a deadly spring.Early
on the morning of May 6th Hancock was reenforced by Burnside, and Hill by
Longstreet.Grant issued orders, through Meade, for a general attack by Sedgwick,
Warren, and Hancock along the entire line, at five o'clock on the morning
of the 6th.Fifteen minutes before five the Confederates opened fire on
Sedgwick's right, and soon the battle was raging along the whole five-mile
front.It became a hand-to-hand contest.The Federals advanced with great
difficulty.The combatants came upon each other but a few paces apart.Soldiers on one side became hopelessly mixed with those of the other.Artillery played but little part in the battle of the Wilderness.The
cavalry of the two armies had one indecisive engagement on the 5th.The
next day both Custer and Gregg repulsed Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in two
separate encounters, but Sheridan was unable to follow up the advantage.He had been entrusted with the care of the wagon trains and dared not take
his cavalry too far from them.The battle was chiefly one of musketry.Volley upon volley was poured out unceasingly; screaming bullets mingled
with terrific yells in the dense woods.The noise became deafening, and
the wounded and dying lying on the ground among the trees made a scene of
indescribable horror.Living men rushed in to take the places of those
who had fallen.The missiles cut branches from the trees, and saplings
were mowed down as grass in a meadow is cut by a scythe.Bloody remnants
of uniforms, blue and gray, hung as weird and uncanny decorations from
remaining branches.The story of the Federal right during the morning is easily told.Persistently and often as he tried, Warren could make no impression on the
strongly entrenched Ewell--nor could Sedgwick, who was trying equally hard
with Wright's division of his corps.But with Hancock on the left, in his
entrenchments on the Brock road, it was different.The gallant and heroic
charges here have elicited praise and admiration from friend and foe
alike.At first, Hill was forced back in disorder, and driven in confusion
a mile and a half from his line.The Confederates seemed on the verge of
panic and rout.From the rear of the troops in gray came the beloved
leader of the Southern host, General Lee.He was astride his favorite
battle-horse, and his face was set in lines of determination.Though the
crisis of the battle for the Confederates had arrived, Lee's voice was
calm and soft as he commanded, "Follow me," and then urged his charger
toward the bristling front of the Federal lines.The Confederate ranks
were electrified by the brave example of their commander.A ragged veteran
who had followed Lee through many campaigns, leaped forward and caught the
bridle-rein of the horse."We won't go on until you go back," cried the
devoted warrior.Instantly the Confederate ranks resounded with the cry,
"Lee to the rear!and the great general went back to
safety while his soldiers again took up the gage of battle and plunged
into the smoke and death-laden storm.But Lee, by his personal presence,
and the arrival of Longstreet, had restored order and courage in the
ranks, and their original position was soon regained.The pursuit of the Confederates through the dense forest had caused
confusion and disorganization in Hancock's corps.That cohesion and
strength in a battle-line of soldiers, where the men can "feel the touch,"
shoulder to shoulder, was wanting, and the usual form and regular
alignment was broken.It was two hours before the lines were re-formed.That short time had been well utilized by the Confederates.Gregg's eight
hundred Texans made a desperate charge through the thicket of the pine
against Webb's brigade of Hancock's corps, cutting through the growth, and
wildly shouting amid the crash and roar of the battle.Half of their
number were left on the field, but the blow had effectually checked the
Federal advance.While the battle was raging Grant's general demeanor was imperturbable.He
remained with Meade nearly the whole day at headquarters at the Lacy
house.He sat upon a stump most of the time, or at the foot of a tree,
leaning against its trunk, whittling sticks with his pocket-knife and
smoking big black cigars--twenty during the day.He received reports of
the progress of the battle and gave orders without the least evidence of
excitement or emotion."His orders," said one of his staff, "were given
with a spur," implying instant action.On one occasion, when an officer,
in great excitement, brought him the report of Hancock's misfortune and
expressed apprehension as to Lee's purpose, Grant exclaimed with some
warmth: "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing what Lee is going to do.Go
back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves."Several brigades of Longstreet's troops, though weary from their forced
march, were sent on a flanking movement against Hancock's left, which
demoralized Mott's division and caused it to fall back three-quarters of a
mile.Longstreet now advanced with the rest of his corps.The dashing
leader, while riding with Generals Kershaw and Jenkins at the head of
Jenkins' brigade on the right of the Southern battle array, was screened
by the tangled thickets from the view of his own troops, flushed with the
success of brilliant flank movement.Suddenly the passing column was seen
indistinctly through an opening and a volley burst forth and struck the
officers.When the smoke lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down--the
former seriously wounded, and the latter killed outright.As at
Chancellorsville a year before and on the same battle-ground, a great
captain of the Confederacy was shot down by his own men, and by accident,
at the crisis of a battle.Jackson lingered several days after
Chancellorsville, while Longstreet recovered and lived to fight for the
Confederacy till the surrender at Appomattox.General Wadsworth, of
Hancock's corps, was mortally wounded during the day, while making a
daring assault on the Confederate works, at the head of his men.During the afternoon, the Confederate attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's
forces, which constituted nearly half the entire army, was so severe that
the Federal lines began to give way.The combatants swayed back and forth;
the Confederates seized the Federal breastworks repeatedly, only to be
repulsed again and again.Once, the Southern colors were placed on the
Union battlements.A fire in the forest, which had been burning for hours,
and in which, it is estimated, about two hundred of the Federal wounded
perished, was communicated to the timber entrenchments, the heat and smoke
driving into the faces of the men on the Union side, and compelling them
in some places to abandon the works.Hancock made a gallant and heroic
effort to re-form his lines and push the attack, and, as he rode along the
lines, his inspiring presence elicited cheer upon cheer from the men, but
the troops had exhausted their ammunition, the wagons were in the rear,
and as night was approaching, further attack was abandoned.The contest
ended on the lines where it began.Later in the evening consternation swept the Federal camp when heavy
firing was heard in the direction of Sedgwick's corps, on the right.The
report was current that the entire Sixth Corps had been attacked and
broken.What had happened was a surprise attack by the Confederates,
commanded by General John B. Gordon, on Sedgwick's right flank, Generals
Seymour and Shaler with six hundred men being captured.When a message was
received from Sedgwick that the Sixth Corps was safe in an entirely new
line, there was great rejoicing in the Union camp.Thus ended the two days' fighting of the battle of the Wilderness, one of
the greatest struggles in history.It was Grant's first experience in the
East, and his trial measure of arms with his great antagonist, General
Lee.The latter returned to his entrenchments and the Federals remained in
their position.While Grant had been
defeated in his plan to pass around Lee, yet he had made a new record for
the Army of the Potomac, and he was not turned from his purpose of putting
himself between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.During the two days' engagement, there were ten hours of
actual fighting, with a loss in killed and wounded of about seventeen
thousand Union and nearly twelve thousand Confederates, nearly three
thousand men sacrificed each hour.It is the belief of some military
writers that Lee deliberately chose the Wilderness as a battle-ground, as
it would effectually conceal great inferiority of force, but if this be so
he seems to have come to share the unanimous opinions of the generals of
both sides that its difficulties were unsurmountable, and within his
entrenchments he awaited further attack.The next night, May 7th, Grant's march by the Confederate right flank was
resumed, but only to be blocked again by the dogged determination of the
tenacious antagonist, a few miles beyond, at Spotsylvania.It is not strange that the minds of these two
men moved along the same lines in military strategy, when we remember they
were both military experts of the highest order, and were now working out
the same problem.The results obtained by each are told in the story of
the battle of Spotsylvania.[Illustration: LEE'S MEN]

The faces of the veterans in this photograph of 1864 reflect more forcibly
than volumes of historical essays, the privations and the courage of the
ragged veterans in gray who faced Grant, with Lee as their leader.They
did not know that their struggle had already become unavailing; that no
amount of perseverance and devotion could make headway against the
resources, determination, and discipline of the Northern armies, now that
they had become concentrated and wielded by a master of men like Grant.But Grant was as yet little more than a name to the armies of the East.His successes had been won on Western fields--Donelson, Vicksburg,
Chattanooga.It was not yet known that the Army of the Potomac under the
new general-in-chief was to prove irresistible.[Illustration: CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN VIRGINIA, 1864

captures during May and June, when he sent some ten thousand Confederates
to Coxey's Landing, Virginia, as a result of his first stroke against
Lee--though their arms have been taken from them, though their uniforms
are anything but "uniform," their hats partly the regulation felt of the
Army of Northern Virginia, partly captured Federal caps, and partly
nondescript--yet these ragged veterans stand and sit with the dignity of
accomplishment.To them, "Marse Robert" is still the general
unconquerable, under whom inferior numbers again and again have held their
own, and more; the brilliant leader under whom every man gladly rushes to
any assault, however impossible it seems, knowing that every order will be
made to count.[Illustration: THE COMING OF THE STRANGER GRANT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Hither, to Meade's headquarters at Brandy Station, came Grant on March 10,
1864.The day before, in Washington, President Lincoln handed him his
commission, appointing him Lieutenant-General in command of all the
Federal forces.His visit to Washington convinced him of the wisdom of
remaining in the East to direct affairs, and his first interview with
Meade decided him to retain that efficient general in command of the Army
of the Potomac.The two men had known each other but slightly from casual
meetings during the Mexican War."I was a stranger to most of the Army of
the Potomac," said Grant, "but Meade's modesty and willingness to serve in
any capacity impressed me even more than had his victory at Gettysburg."The only prominent officers Grant brought on from the West were Sheridan
and Rawlins.[Illustration: SIGNALING ORDERS FROM GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS, JUST
BEFORE THE WILDERNESS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In April, 1864, General Meade's headquarters lay north of the Rapidan.The
Signal Corps was kept busy transmitting the orders preliminary to the
Wilderness campaign, which was to begin May 5th.The headquarters are
below the brow of the hill.A most important part of the Signal Corps'
duty was the interception and translation of messages interchanged between
the Confederate signal-men.A veteran of Sheridan's army tells of his
impressions as follows: "On the evening of the 18th of October, 1864, the
soldiers of Sheridan's army lay in their lines at Cedar Creek.Our
attention was suddenly directed to the ridge of Massanutten, or Three Top
Mountain, the <DW72> of which covered the left wing of the army--the Eighth
Corps.A lively series of signals was being flashed out from the peak, and
it was evident that messages were being sent both eastward and westward of
the ridge.I can recall now the feeling with which we looked up at those
flashes going over our heads, knowing that they must be Confederate
messages.It was only later that we learned that a keen-eyed Union officer
had been able to read the message: 'To Lieutenant-General Early.Be ready
to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.The sturdiness of Sheridan's veterans and
the fresh spirit put into the hearts of the men by the return of Sheridan
himself from 'Winchester, twenty miles away,' a ride rendered immortal by
Read's poem, proved too much at last for the pluck and persistency of
Early's worn-out troops."[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE FRONT

the Army of the Potomac awoke to the activity of the spring campaign.One
of the first essentials was to get the vast transport trains in readiness
to cross the Rapidan.Wagons were massed by thousands at Culpeper, near
where Meade's troops had spent the winter.The work of the teamsters was
most arduous; wearied by long night marches--nodding, reins in hand, for
lack of sleep--they might at any moment be suddenly attacked in a bold
attempt to capture or destroy their precious freight.When the
arrangements were completed, each wagon bore the corps badge, division
color, and number of the brigade it was to serve.Its contents were also
designated, together with the branch of the service for which it was
intended.While loaded, the wagons must keep pace with the army movements
whenever possible in order to be parked at night near the brigades to
which they belonged.[Illustration: THE "GRAND CAMPAIGN" UNDER WAY--THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE

under Sedgwick and Warren's Fifth Corps began crossing on the morning of
May 4, 1864.The Second Corps, under Hancock, crossed at Ely's Ford,
farther to the east.The cavalry, under Sheridan, was in advance.By night
the army, with the exception of Burnside's Ninth Corps, was south of the
Rapidan, advancing into the Wilderness.The Ninth Corps (a reserve of
twenty thousand men) remained temporarily north of the Rappahannock,
guarding railway communications.On the wooden pontoon-bridge the
rear-guard is crossing while the pontonniers are taking up the canvas
bridge beyond.The movement was magnificently managed; Grant believed it
to be a complete surprise, as Lee had offered no opposition.In the baffling fighting of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court
House, Grant was to lose a third of his superior number, arriving a month
later on the James with a dispirited army that had left behind 54,926
comrades in a month.[Illustration: THE TANGLED BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Edge of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.Stretching away to the westward
between Grant's army and Lee's lay no-man's-land--the Wilderness.Covered
with a second-growth of thicket, thorny underbrush, and twisted vines, it
was an almost impassable labyrinth, with here and there small clearings in
which stood deserted barns and houses, reached only by unused and
overgrown farm roads.The Federal advance into this region was not a
surprise to Lee, as Grant supposed.The Confederate commander had caused
the region to be carefully surveyed, hoping for the precise opportunity
that Grant was about to give him.At the very outset of the campaign he
could strike the Federals in a position where superior numbers counted
little.If he could drive Grant beyond the Rappahannock--as he had forced
Pope, Burnside and Hooker before him--says George Cary Eggleston (in the
"History of the Confederate War"), "loud and almost irresistible would
have been the cry for an armistice, supported (as it would have been) by
Wall Street and all Europe."[Illustration: WHERE EWELL'S CHARGE SURPRISED GRANT

before, while they fought in the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.In the picture
we see some of the customary breastworks which both contending armies
threw up to strengthen their positions.These were in a field near the
turnpike in front of Ewell's main line.The impracticable nature of the
ground tore the lines on both sides into fragments; as they swept back and
forth, squads and companies strove fiercely with one another,
hand-to-hand.Grant had confidently expressed the belief to one of his
staff officers that there was no more advance left in Lee's army.He was
surprised to learn on the 5th that Ewell's Corps was marching rapidly down
the Orange turnpike to strike at Sedgwick and Warren, while A. P. Hill,
with Longstreet close behind, was pushing forward on the Orange plank-road
against Hancock.LEE GIVES BLOW FOR BLOW

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Another view of Ewell's advanced entrenchments--the bark still fresh where
the Confederates had worked with the logs.In the Wilderness, Lee, ever
bold and aggressive, executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of his
career.His advance was a sudden surprise for Grant, and the manner in
which he gave battle was another.Grant harbored the notion that his
adversary would act on the defensive, and that there would be opportunity
to attack the Army of Northern Virginia only behind strong entrenchments.But in the Wilderness, Lee's veterans, the backbone of the South's
fighting strength, showed again their unquenchable spirit of
aggressiveness.They came forth to meet Grant's men on equal terms in the
thorny thickets.About noon, May 5th, the stillness was broken by the
rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery, which told that Warren had
met with resistance on the turnpike and that the battle had begun.Nearly
a mile were Ewell's men driven back, and then they came magnificently on
again, fighting furiously in the smoke-filled thickets with Warren's now
retreating troops.Sedgwick, coming to the support of Warren, renewed the
conflict.To the southward on the plank road, Getty's division, of the
Sixth Corps, hard pressed by the forces of A. P. Hill, was succored by
Hancock with the Second Corps, and together these commanders achieved what
seemed success.It was brief; Longstreet was close at hand to save the day
for the Confederates.TREES IN THE TRACK OF THE IRON STORM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Wilderness to the north of the Orange turnpike.Over ground like this,
where men had seldom trod before, ebbed and flowed the tide of trampling
thousands on May 5 and 6, 1864.Artillery, of which Grant had a
superabundance, was well-nigh useless, wreaking its impotent fury upon the
defenseless trees.Even the efficacy of musketry fire was hampered.Men
tripping and falling in the tangled underbrush arose bleeding from the
briars to struggle with an adversary whose every movement was impeded
also.The cold steel of the bayonet finished the work which rifles had
begun.In the terrible turmoil of death the hopes of both Grant and Lee
were doomed to disappointment.Lee,
disregarding his own safety, endeavored to rally the disordered ranks of
A. P. Hill, and could only be persuaded to retire by the pledge of
Longstreet that his advancing force would win the coveted victory.Falling
upon Hancock's flank, the fresh troops seemed about to crush the Second
Corps, as Jackson's men had crushed the Eleventh the previous year at
Chancellorsville.But now, as Jackson, at the critical moment, had fallen
by the fire of his own men, so Longstreet and his staff, galloping along
the plank road, were mistaken by their own soldiers for Federals and fired
upon.A minie-ball struck Longstreet in the shoulder, and he was carried
from the field, feebly waving his hat that his men might know that he was
not killed.With him departed from the field the life of the attack.[Illustration: A LOSS IN "EFFECTIVE STRENGTH"--WOUNDED AT FREDERICKSBURG

those uninhabited thickets.There many of them died alone, and some
perished in the horror of a forest fire on the night of May 5th.The
Federals lost many gallant officers, among them the veteran Wadsworth.The
Confederates lost Generals Jenkins and Jones, killed, and suffered a
staggering blow in the disabling of Longstreet.The series of battles of
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania campaigns were more costly to the Federals
than Antietam and Gettysburg combined.[Illustration: ONE OF GRANT'S FIELD-TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN 1864

excellent idea of the difficulties under which telegraphing was done at
the front or on the march.With a tent-fly for shelter and a hard-tack box
for a table, the resourceful operator mounted his "relay," tested his
wire, and brought the commanding general into direct communication with
separated brigades or divisions.The U. S. Military Telegraph Corps,
through its Superintendent of Construction, Dennis Doren, kept Meade and
both wings of his army in communication from the crossing of the Rapidan
in May, 1864, till the siege of Petersburg.Over this field-line Grant
received daily reports from four separate armies, numbering a quarter of a
million men, and replied with daily directions for their operations over
an area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square miles.Though every
corps of Meade's army moved daily, Doren kept them in touch with
headquarters.The field-line was built of seven twisted, rubber-coated
wires which were hastily strung on trees or fences.TELEGRAPHING FOR THE ARMIES

The man who established the Federal military telegraph system amid the
first horrors of war was to become one of the world's foremost advocates
of peace.As the right hand man of Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of
War, he came to Washington in '61, and was immediately put in charge of
the field work of reestablishing communication between the Capital and the
North, cut off by the Maryland mobs.A telegraph operator himself, he
inaugurated the system of cipher despatches for the War Department and
secured the trusted operators with whom the service was begun.A young man
of twenty-four at the time, he was one of the last to leave the
battlefield of Bull Run, and his duties of general superintendence over
the network of railroads and telegraph lines made him a witness of war's
cruelties on other fields until he with his chief left the government
service June 1, 1862.THE MILITARY FIELD TELEGRAPH

"No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph."Thus wrote
General Grant in his memoirs."The moment troops were in position to go
into camp, the men would put up their wires."Grant pays a glowing tribute
to "the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent
men."[Illustration: THE ARMY SAVING THE NAVY IN MAY, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration]

Here the army is saving the navy by a brilliant piece of engineering that
prevented the loss of a fleet worth $2,000,000.The Red River expedition
was one of the most humiliating ever undertaken by the Federals.Porter's
fleet, which had so boldly advanced above the falls at Alexandria, was
ordered back, only to find that the river was so low as to imprison twelve
vessels.Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Bailey, acting engineer of the Nineteenth
Corps, obtained permission to build a dam in order to make possible the
passage of the fleet.Begun on April 30, 1864, the work was finished on
the 8th of May, almost entirely by the soldiers, working incessantly day
and night, often up to their necks in water and under the broiling sun.Bailey succeeded in turning the whole current into one channel and the
squadron passed below to safety.Not often have inland lumbermen been the
means of saving a navy.[Illustration: COLONEL JOSEPH BAILEY IN 1864.THE MAN WHO SAVED THE FLEET.]The army engineers laughed at this wide-browed, unassuming man when he
suggested building a dam so as to release Admiral Porter's fleet
imprisoned by low water above the Falls at Alexandria at the close of the
futile Red River expedition in 1864.Bailey had been a lumberman in
Wisconsin and had there gained the practical experience which taught him
that the plan was feasible.He was Acting Chief Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps at this time, and obtained permission to go ahead and build his
dam.In the undertaking he had the approval and earnest support of Admiral
Porter, who refused to consider for a moment the abandonment of any of his
vessels even though the Red River expedition had been ordered to return
and General Banks was chafing at delay and sending messages to Porter that
his troops must be got in motion at once.Bailey pushed on with his work and in eleven days he succeeded in so
raising the water in the channel that all the Federal vessels were able to
pass down below the Falls."Words are inadequate," said Admiral Porter, in
his report, "to express the admiration I feel for the ability of Lieut.This is without doubt the best engineering feat ever
performed.... The highest honors the Government can bestow on Colonel
Bailey can never repay him for the service he has rendered the country."For this achievement Bailey was promoted to colonel, brevetted brigadier
general, voted the thanks of Congress, and presented with a sword and a
purse of $3,000 by the officers of Porter's fleet.He settled in Missouri
after the war and was a formidable enemy of the "Bushwhackers" till he was
shot by them on March 21, 1867.He was born at Salem, Ohio, April 28,
1827.[Illustration: READY FOR HER BAPTISM.COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This powerful gunboat, the _Lafayette_, though accompanying Admiral Porter
on the Red River expedition, was not one of those entrapped at Alexandria.Her heavy draft precluded her being taken above the Falls.Here we see her
lying above Vicksburg in the spring of 1863.She and her sister ship, the
_Choctaw_, were side-wheel steamers altered into casemate ironclads with
rams.The _Lafayette_ had the stronger armament, carrying two 11-inch
Dahlgrens forward, four 9-inch guns in the broadside, and two 24-pound
howitzers, with two 100-pound Parrott guns astern.She and the _Choctaw_
were the most important acquisitions to Porter's fleet toward the end of
1862.The _Lafayette_ was built and armed for heavy fighting.She got her
first taste of it on the night of April 16, 1863, when Porter took part of
his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries to support Grant's crossing of the
river in an advance on Vicksburg from below.The Lafayette, with a barge
and a transport lashed to her, held her course with difficulty through the
tornado of shot and shell which poured from the Confederate batteries on
the river front in Vicksburg as soon as the movement was discovered.The
_Lafayette_ stood up to this fiery christening and successfully ran the
gantlet, as did all the other vessels save one transport.She was
commanded during the Red River expedition by Lieutenant-Commander J. P.
Foster.[Illustration: FARRAGUT AT THE PINNACLE OF HIS FAME

the southward he was regarded as utterly foolhardy.All that was needed,
however, to make Fox's plan successful was the man with spirit enough to
undertake it and judgment sufficient to carry it out.Here on the deck of
the fine new sloop-of-war that had been assigned to him as flagship,
stands the man who had just accomplished a greater feat that made him a
world figure as famous as Nelson.The Confederacy had found its great
general among its own people, but the great admiral of the war, although
of Southern birth, had refused to fight against the flag for which, as a
boy in the War of 1812, he had seen men die.Full of the fighting spirit
of the old navy, he was able to achieve the first great victory that gave
new hope to the Federal cause.Percival Drayton was also a Southerner, a
South Carolinian, whose brothers and uncles were fighting for the South.[Illustration: "FAR BY GRAY MORGAN'S WALLS"--THE MOBILE BAY FORT, BATTERED
BY FARRAGUT'S GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]How formidable was Farragut's undertaking in forcing his way into Mobile
Bay is apparent from these photographs.For wooden vessels to pass Morgan
and Gaines, two of the strongest forts on the coast, was pronounced by
experts most foolhardy.Besides, the channel was planted with torpedoes
that might blow the ships to atoms, and within the bay was the Confederate
ram _Tennessee_, thought to be the most powerful ironclad ever put afloat.In the arrangements for the attack, Farragut's flagship, the _Hartford_,
was placed second, the _Brooklyn_ leading the line of battleships, which
were preceded by four monitors.At a quarter before six, on the morning of
August 5th, the fleet moved.Half an hour later it came within range of
Fort Morgan.The
monitor _Tecumseh_, eager to engage the Confederate ram _Tennessee_ behind
the line of torpedoes, ran straight ahead, struck a torpedo, and in a few
minutes went down with most of the crew.As the monitor sank, the
_Brooklyn_ recoiled.Farragut signaled: "What's the trouble?""Torpedoes,"
was the answer."Go ahead, Captain
Drayton.Finding that the smoke from the guns obstructed the
view from the deck, Farragut ascended to the rigging of the main mast,
where he was in great danger of being struck and of falling to the deck.The captain accordingly ordered a quartermaster to tie him in the shrouds.The _Hartford_, under a full head of steam, rushed over the torpedo ground
far in advance of the fleet.The Confederate
ram, invulnerable to the broadsides of the Union guns, steamed alone for
the ships, while the ramparts of the two forts were crowded with
spectators of the coming conflict.The ironclad monster made straight for
the flagship, attempting to ram it and paying no attention to the fire or
the ramming of the other vessels.Its first effort was unsuccessful, but a
second came near proving fatal.It then became a target for the whole
Union fleet; finally its rudder-chain was shot away and it became
unmanageable; in a few minutes it raised the white flag.No wonder
Americans call Farragut the greatest of naval commanders.[Illustration: WHERE BROADSIDES STRUCK]

she steamed in line to the attack of Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay on the
morning of August 5, 1864.Every man was at his station thinking his own
thoughts in the suspense of that moment.On the quarterdeck stood Captain
Percival Drayton and his staff.Near them was the chief-quartermaster,
John H. Knowles, ready to hoist the signals that would convey Farragut's
orders to the fleet.The admiral himself was in the port main shrouds
twenty-five feet above the deck.All was silence aboard till the
"Hartford" was in easy range of the fort.Then the great broadsides of the
old ship began to take their part in the awful cannonade.During the early
part of the action Captain Drayton, fearing that some damage to the
rigging might pitch Farragut overboard, sent Knowles on his famous
mission."I went up," said the old sailor, "with a piece of lead line and
made it fast to one of the forward shrouds, and then took it around the
admiral to the after shroud, making it fast there.The admiral said,
'Never mind, I'm all right,' but I went ahead and obeyed orders."Later
Farragut, undoing the lashing with his own hands, climbed higher still.[Illustration: QUARTERMASTER KNOWLES]

amazing courage and skill; the rapidity and accuracy of their fire was
rarely equalled in the war.In the terrible conflict the "Hartford" was
struck twenty times, the "Brooklyn" thirty, the "Octorora" seventeen, the
"Metacomet" eleven, the "Lackawanna" five, the "Ossipee" four, the
"Monongahela" five, the "Kennebec" two, and the "Galena" seven.Of the
monitors the "Chickasaw" was struck three times, the "Manhattan" nine, and
the "Winnebago" nineteen.The total loss in the Federal fleet was 52
killed and 170 wounded, while on the Confederate gunboats 12 were killed
and 20 wounded.The night after the battle the "Metacomet" was turned into
a hospital ship and the wounded of both sides were taken to Pensacola.The
pilot of the captured "Tennessee" guided the Federal ship through the
torpedoes, and as she was leaving Pensacola on her return trip Midshipman
Carter of the "Tennessee," who also was on the "Metacomet," called out
from the wharf: "Don't attempt to fire No.2 gun (of the "Tennessee"), as
there is a shell jammed in the bore, and the gun will burst and kill some
one."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE--THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD RAM
"TENNESSEE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mobile Bay, on the morning of August 5, 1864, was the arena of more
conspicuous heroism than marked any naval battle-ground of the entire war.Among all the daring deeds of that day stands out superlatively the
gallant manner in which Admiral Franklin Buchanan, C. S. N., fought his
vessel, the "Tennessee.""You shall not have it to say when you leave this
vessel that you were not near enough to the enemy, for I will meet them,
and then you can fight them alongside of their own ships; and if I fall,
lay me on one side and go on with the fight."Thus Buchanan addressed his
men, and then, taking his station in the pilot-house, he took his vessel
into action.The Federal fleet carried more power for destruction than the
combined English, French, and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and yet
Buchanan made good his boast that he would fight alongside.No sooner had
Farragut crossed the torpedoes than Buchanan matched that deed, running
through the entire line of Federal vessels, braving their broadsides, and
coming to close quarters with most of them.Then the "Tennessee" ran under
the guns of Fort Morgan for a breathing space.In half an hour she was
steaming up the bay to fight the entire squadron single-handed.Such
boldness was scarce believable, for Buchanan had now not alone wooden
ships to contend with, as when in the "Merrimac" he had dismayed the
Federals in Hampton Roads.Three powerful monitors were to oppose him at
point-blank range.For nearly an hour the gunners in the "Tennessee"
fought, breathing powder-smoke amid an atmosphere superheated to 120
degrees.Buchanan was serving a gun himself when he was wounded and
carried to the surgeon's table below.Captain Johnston fought on for
another twenty minutes, and then the "Tennessee," with her rudder and
engines useless and unable to fire a gun, was surrendered, after a
reluctant consent had been wrung from Buchanan, as he lay on the operating
table.[Illustration]

  _Copyright, 1901, by Perrien-Keydel Co.,
  Detroit, Mich., U. S. A._]




THE BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

    But to Spotsylvania history will accord the palm, I am sure, for
    having furnished an unexampled muzzle-to-muzzle fire; the longest roll
    of incessant, unbroken musketry; the most splendid exhibition of
    individual heroism and personal daring by large numbers, who, standing
    in the freshly spilt blood of their fellows, faced for so long a
    period and at so short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded the
    decrees of death.It was
    exhibited by both armies, and in that hand-to-hand struggle for the
    possession of the breastworks it seemed almost universal.It would be
    commonplace truism to say that such examples will not be lost to the
    Republic.--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of the
    Civil War."_


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities on the 6th of May in the
Wilderness, Grant determined to move his army to Spotsylvania Court House,
and to start the wagon trains on the afternoon of the 7th.Grant's object
was, by a flank move, to get between Lee and Richmond.Lee foresaw Grant's
purpose and also moved his cavalry, under Stuart, across the opponent's
path.As an illustration of the exact science of war we see the two great
military leaders racing for position at Spotsylvania Court House.It was
revealed later that Lee had already made preparations on this field a year
before, in anticipation of its being a possible battle-ground.Apprised of the movement of the Federal trains, Lee, with his usual
sagacious foresight, surmised their destination.He therefore ordered
General R. H. Anderson, now in command of Longstreet's corps, to march to
Spotsylvania Court House at three o'clock on the morning of the 8th.But
the smoke and flames from the burning forests that surrounded Anderson's
camp in the Wilderness made the position untenable, and the march was
begun at eleven o'clock on the night of the 7th.This early start proved
of inestimable value to the Confederates.Anderson's right, in the
Wilderness, rested opposite Hancock's left, and the Confederates secured a
more direct line of march to Spotsylvania, several miles shorter than that
of the Federals.The same night General Ewell at the extreme Confederate
left was ordered to follow Anderson at daylight, if he found no large
force in his front.This order was followed out, there being no opposing
troops, and the corps took the longest route of any of Lee's troops.General Ewell found the march exhausting and distressing on account of the
intense heat and dust and smoke from the burning forests.The Federal move toward Spotsylvania Court House was begun after dark on
the 7th.Warren's corps, in the lead, took the Brock road behind Hancock's
position and was followed by Sedgwick, who marched by way of
Chancellorsville.Burnside came next, but he was halted to guard the
trains.Hancock, covering the move, did not start the head of his command
until some time after daylight.When Warren reached Todd's Tavern he found
the Union cavalry under Merritt in conflict with Fitzhugh Lee's division
of Stuart's cavalry.Warren sent Robinson's division ahead; it drove
Fitzhugh Lee back, and, advancing rapidly, met the head of Anderson's
troops.The leading brigades came to the assistance of the cavalry; Warren
was finally repulsed and began entrenching.The Confederates gained
Spotsylvania Court House.Throughout the day there was continual skirmishing between the troops, as
the Northerners attempted to break the line of the Confederates.Every advance of the blue was repulsed.Lee again
blocked the way of Grant's move.The Federal loss during the day had been
about thirteen hundred, while the Confederates lost fewer men than their
opponents.The work of both was now the construction of entrenchments, which
consisted of earthworks sloping to either side, with logs as a parapet,
and between these works and the opposing army were constructed what are
known as abatis, felled trees, with the branches cut off, the sharp ends
projecting toward the approaching forces.Lee's entrenchments were of such character as to increase the efficiency
of his force.They were formed in the shape of a huge V with the apex
flattened, forming a salient angle against the center of the Federal line.The Confederate lines were facing north, northwest, and northeast, the
corps commanded by Anderson on the left, Ewell in the center, and Early on
the right, the latter temporarily replacing A. P. Hill, who was ill.The
Federals confronting them were Burnside on the left, Sedgwick and Warren
in the center, and Hancock on the right.The day of the 9th was spent in placing the lines of troops, with no
fighting except skirmishing and some sharp-shooting.While placing some
field-pieces, General Sedgwick was hit by a sharpshooter's bullet and
instantly killed.He was a man of high character, a most competent
commander, of fearless courage, loved and lamented by the army.General
Horatio G. Wright succeeded to the command of the Sixth Corps.Early on the morning of the 10th, the Confederates discovered that Hancock
had crossed the Po River in front of his position of the day before and
was threatening their rear.Grant had suspected that Lee was about to move
north toward Fredericksburg, and Hancock had been ordered to make a
reconnaissance with a view to attacking and turning the Confederate left.But difficulties stood in the way of Hancock's performance, and before he
had accomplished much, Meade directed him to send two of his divisions to
assist Warren in making an attack on the Southern lines.The Second Corps
started to recross the Po.Before all were over Early made a vigorous
assault on the rear division, which did not escape without heavy loss.In
this engagement the corps lost the first gun in its most honorable career,
a misfortune deeply lamented by every man in the corps, since up to this
moment it had long been the only one in the entire army which could make
the proud claim of never having lost a gun or a color.But the great event of the 10th was the direct assault upon the
Confederate front.Meade had arranged for Hancock to take charge of this,
and the appointed hour was five in the afternoon.But Warren reported
earlier that the opportunity was most favorable, and he was ordered to
start at once.Wearing his full uniform, the leader of the Fifth Corps
advanced at a quarter to four with the greater portion of his troops.The
progress of the valiant Northerners was one of the greatest difficulty,
owing to the dense wood of low cedar-trees through which they had to make
their way.Longstreet's corps behind their entrenchments acknowledged the
advance with very heavy artillery and musket fire.But Warren's troops did
not falter or pause until some had reached the abatis and others the very
crest of the parapet.A few, indeed, were actually killed inside the
works.All, however, who survived the terrible ordeal were finally driven
back with heavy loss.General James C. Rice was mortally wounded.To the left of Warren, General Wright had observed what he believed to be
a vulnerable spot in the Confederate entrenchments.Behind this particular
place was stationed Doles' brigade of Georgia regiments, and Colonel Emory
Upton was ordered to charge Doles with a column of twelve regiments in
four lines.The ceasing of the Federal artillery at six o'clock was the
signal for the charge, and twenty minutes later, as Upton tells us, "at
command, the lines rose, moved noiselessly to the edge of the wood, and
then, with a wild cheer and faces averted, rushed for the works.Through a
terrible front and flank fire the column advanced quickly, gaining the
parapet.Here occurred a deadly hand-to-hand conflict.The enemy, sitting
in their pits with pieces upright, loaded, and with bayonets fixed ready
to impale the first who should leap over, absolutely refused to yield the
ground.The first of our men who tried to surmount the works fell, pierced
through the head by musket-balls.Others, seeing the fate of their
comrades, held their pieces at arm's length and fired downward, while
others, poising their pieces vertically, hurled them down upon their
enemy, pinning them to the ground.... The struggle lasted but a few
seconds.Numbers prevailed, and like a resistless wave, the column poured
over the works, quickly putting _hors de combat_ those who resisted and
sending to the rear those who surrendered.Pressing forward and expanding
to the right and left, the second line of entrenchments, its line of
battle, and a battery fell into our hands.The column of assault had
accomplished its task."The Confederate line had been shattered and an opening made for expected
support.General Mott, on the left, did
not bring his division forward as had been planned and as General Wright
had ordered.The Confederates were reenforced, and Upton could do no more
than hold the captured entrenchments until ordered to retire.He brought
twelve hundred prisoners and several stands of colors back to the Union
lines; but over a thousand of his own men were killed or wounded.For
gallantry displayed in this charge, Colonel Upton was made
brigadier-general.The losses to the Union army in this engagement at Spotsylvania were over
four thousand.The loss to the Confederates was probably two thousand.The two giant antagonists took a
breathing spell.It was on the morning of this date that Grant penned the
sentence, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,"
to his chief of staff, General Halleck.During this time Sheridan, who had brought the cavalry up to a state of
great efficiency, was making an expedition to the vicinity of Richmond.He
had said that if he were permitted to operate independently of the army he
would draw Stuart after him.Grant at once gave the order, and Sheridan
made a detour around Lee's army, engaging and defeating the Confederate
cavalry, which he greatly outnumbered, on the 11th of May, at Yellow
Tavern, where General Stuart, the brilliant commander of the Confederate
cavalry, was mortally wounded.Grant carefully went over the ground and decided upon another attack on
the 12th.About four hundred yards of clear ground lay in front of the
sharp angle, or salient, of Lee's lines.After the battle this point was
known as the "Bloody Angle," and also as "Hell's Hole."Here Hancock was
ordered to make an attack at daybreak on the 12th.Lee had been expecting
a move on the part of Grant.On the evening of the 10th he sent to Ewell
this message: "It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line
to-night.... Perhaps Grant will make a night attack, as it was a favorite
amusement of his at Vicksburg."Through rain and mud Hancock's force was gotten into position within a few
hundred yards of the Confederate breastworks.He was now between Burnside
and Wright.At the first approach of dawn the four divisions of the Second
Corps, under Birney, Mott, Barlow, and Gibbon (in reserve) moved
noiselessly to the designated point of attack.Without a shot being fired
they reached the Confederate entrenchments, and struck with fury and
impetuosity a mortal blow at the point where least expected, on the
salient, held by General Edward Johnson of Ewell's corps.The movement of
the Federals was so swift and the surprise so complete, that the
Confederates could make practically no resistance, and were forced to
surrender.The artillery had been withdrawn from the earthworks occupied by Johnson's
troops on the previous night, but developments had led to an order to
have it returned early in the morning.It was approaching as the attack
was made.Before the artillerymen could escape or turn the guns upon the
Federals, every cannon had been captured.General Johnson with almost his
whole division, numbering about three thousand, and General Steuart, were
captured, between twenty and thirty colors, and several thousand stands of
arms were taken.Hancock had already distinguished himself as a leader of
his soldiers, and from his magnificent appearance, noble bearing, and
courage had been called "Hancock the Superb," but this was the most
brilliant of his military achievements.Pressing onward across the first defensive line of the Confederates,
Hancock's men advanced against the second series of trenches, nearly half
a mile beyond.As the Federals pushed through the muddy fields they lost
all formation.The Southerners
were prepared for the attack.A volley poured into the throng of blue, and
General Gordon with his reserve division rushed forward, fighting
desperately to drive the Northerners back.As they did so General Lee rode
up, evidently intending to go forward with Gordon.His horse was seized by
one of the soldiers, and for the second time in the campaign the cry arose
from the ranks, "Lee to the rear!"The beloved commander was led back from
the range of fire, while the men, under the inspiration of his example,
rushed forward in a charge that drove the Federals back until they had
reached the outer line of works.Here they fought stubbornly at deadly
range.Neither side was able to force the other back.But Gordon was not
able to cope with the entire attack.Wright and Warren both sent some of
their divisions to reenforce Hancock, and Lee sent all the assistance
possible to the troops struggling so desperately to restore his line at
the salient.Many vivid and picturesque descriptions of this fighting at the angle have
been written, some by eye-witnesses, others by able historians, but no
printed page, no cold type can convey to the mind the realities of that
terrible conflict.The whole engagement was
practically a hand-to-hand contest.The dead lay beneath the feet of the
living, three and four layers deep.This hitherto quiet spot of earth was
devastated and covered with the slain, weltering in their own blood,
mangled and shattered into scarcely a semblance of human form.Dying men
were crushed by horses and many, buried beneath the mire and mud, still
lived.Some artillery was posted on high ground not far from the apex of
the salient, and an incessant fire was poured into the Confederate works
over the Union lines, while other guns kept up an enfilade of canister
along the west of the salient.The contest from the right of the Sixth to the left of the Second Corps
was kept up throughout the day along the whole line.Repeatedly the
trenches had to be cleared of the dead.An oak tree twenty-two inches in
diameter was cut down by musket-balls.Men leaped upon the breastworks,
firing until shot down.The battle of the "angle" is said to have been the most awful in duration
and intensity in modern times.Battle-line after battle-line, bravely
obeying orders, was annihilated.The entrenchments were shivered and
shattered, trunks of trees carved into split brooms.Sometimes the
contestants came so close together that their muskets met, muzzle to
muzzle, and their flags almost intertwined with each other as they waved
in the breeze.As they fought with the desperation of madmen, the living
would stand on the bodies of the dead to reach over the breastworks with
their weapons of slaughter.Lee hurled his army with unparalleled vigor
against his opponent five times during the day, but each time was
repulsed.Until three o'clock the next morning the slaughter continued,
when the Confederates sank back into their second line of entrenchments,
leaving their opponents where they had stood in the morning.All the
fighting on the 12th was not done at the "Bloody Angle."Burnside on the
left of Hancock engaged Early's troops and was defeated, while on the
other side of the salient Wright succeeded in driving Anderson back.The question has naturally arisen why that "salient" was regarded of such
vital importance as to induce the two chief commanders to force their
armies into such a hand-to-hand contest that must inevitably result in
unparalleled and wholesale slaughter.It was manifest, however, that Grant
had shown generalship in finding the weak point in Lee's line for attack.It was imperative that he hold the gain made by his troops.Lee could ill
afford the loss resistance would entail, but he could not withdraw his
army during the day without disaster.The men on both sides seemed to comprehend the gravity of the situation,
that it was a battle to the death for that little point of entrenchment.Without urging by officers, and sometimes without officers, they fell into
line and fought and bled and died in myriads as though inspired by some
unseen power.Here men rushed to their doom with shouts of courage and
eagerness.The pity of it all was manifested by the shocking scene on that
battlefield the next day.Piles of dead lay around the "Bloody Angle," a
veritable "Hell's Hole" on both sides of the entrenchments, four layers
deep in places, shattered and torn by bullets and hoofs and clubbed
muskets, while beneath the layers of dead, it is said, there could be seen
quivering limbs of those who still lived.General Grant was deeply moved at the terrible loss of life.When he
expressed his regret for the heavy sacrifice of men to General Meade, the
latter replied, "General, we can't do these little tricks without heavy
losses."The total loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing
at Spotsylvania was nearly eighteen thousand.The Confederate losses have
never been positively known, but from the best available sources of
information the number has been placed at not less than nine thousand men.Lee's loss in high officers was very severe, the killed including General
Daniel and General Perrin, while Generals Walker, Ramseur, R. D. Johnston,
and McGowan were severely wounded.In addition to the loss of these
important commanders, Lee was further crippled in efficient commanders by
the capture of Generals Edward Johnson and Steuart.The Union loss in high
officers was light, excepting General Sedgwick on the 9th.General Webb
was wounded, and Colonel <DW53>, of the Second Corps, was killed.Lee's forces had been handled with such consummate skill as to make them
count one almost for two, and there was the spirit of devotion for Lee
among his soldiers which was indeed practically hero-worship.All in all,
he had an army, though shattered and worn, that was almost unconquerable.Grant found that ordinary methods of war, even such as he had experienced
in the West, were not applicable to the Army of Northern Virginia.The
only hope for the Union army was a long-drawn-out process, and with larger
numbers, better kept, and more often relieved, Grant's army would
ultimately make that of Lee's succumb, from sheer exhaustion and
disintegration.The battle was not terminated on the 12th.During the next five days there
was a continuous movement of the Union corps to the east which was met by
a corresponding readjustment of the Confederate lines.After various
maneuvers, Hancock was ordered to the point where the battle was fought on
the 12th, and on the 18th and 19th, the last effort was made to break the
lines of the Confederates.Ewell, however, drove the Federals back and the
next day he had a severe engagement with the Union left wing, while
endeavoring to find out something of Grant's plans.Twelve days of active effort were thus spent in skirmishing, fighting, and
countermarching.In the last two engagements the Union losses were nearly
two thousand, which are included in those before stated.It was decided to
abandon the attempt to dislodge Lee from his entrenchments, and to move
to the North Anna River.On the 20th of May the march was resumed.The men
had suffered great hardships from hunger, exposure, and incessant action,
and many would fall asleep on the line of march.On the day after the start, Hancock crossed the Mattapony River at one
point and Warren at another.Hancock was ordered to take position on the
right bank and, if practicable, to attack the Confederates wherever found.By the 22d, Wright and Burnside came up and the march proceeded.But the
vigilant Lee had again detected the plans of his adversary.Meade's army had barely started in its purpose to turn the Confederates'
flank when the Southern forces were on the way to block the army of the
North.As on the march from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, Lee's troops
took the shorter route, along main roads, and reached the North Anna ahead
of the Federals.Warren's corps was the first of Meade's army to arrive at
the north bank of the river, which it did on the afternoon of May 23d.Lee
was already on the south bank, but Warren crossed without opposition.No
sooner had he gotten over, however, than he was attacked by the
Confederates and a severe but undecisive engagement followed.The next
morning (the 24th) Hancock and Wright put their troops across at places
some miles apart, and before these two wings of the army could be joined,
Lee made a brilliant stroke by marching in between them, forming a wedge
whose point rested on the bank, opposite the Union center, under Burnside,
which had not yet crossed the river.The Army of the Potomac was now in three badly separated parts.Burnside
could not get over in sufficient strength to reenforce the wings, and all
attempts by the latter to aid him in so doing met with considerable
disaster.The loss in these engagements approximated two thousand on each
side.On the 25th, Sheridan and his cavalry rejoined the army.They had been
gone since the 9th and their raid was most successful.Besides the
decisive victory over the Confederate cavalry at Yellow Tavern, they had
destroyed several depots of supplies, four trains of cars, and many miles
of railroad track.Nearly four hundred Federal prisoners on their way to
Richmond had been rescued from their captors.The dashing cavalrymen had
even carried the first line of work around Richmond, and had made a detour
down the James to communicate with General Butler.Grant was highly
satisfied with Sheridan's performance.It had been of the greatest
assistance to him, as it had drawn off the whole of the Confederate
cavalry, and made the guarding of the wagon trains an easy matter.But here, on the banks of the North Anna, Grant had been completely
checkmated by Lee.He realized this and decided on a new move, although he
still clung to his idea of turning the Confederate right.The Federal
wings were withdrawn to the north side of the river during the night of
May 26th and the whole set in motion for the Pamunkey River at
Hanovertown.Two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's corps were
in advance.Lee lost no time in pursuing his great antagonist, but for the
first time the latter was able to hold his lead.Along the Totopotomoy, on
the afternoon of May 28th, infantry and cavalry of both armies met in a
severe engagement in which the strong position of Lee's troops again
foiled Grant's purpose.The Union would have to try at some other point,
and on the 31st Sheridan's cavalry took possession of Cold Harbor.This
was to be the next battle-ground.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1863--GRANT'S CHANGING EXPRESSIONS]

Although secure in his fame as the conqueror of Vicksburg, Grant still has
the greater part of his destiny to fulfil as he faces the camera.Before
him lie the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the slow investment
of Petersburg.This series forms a particularly interesting study in
expression.At the left hand, the face looks almost amused.In the next
the expression is graver, the mouth close set.The third picture looks
plainly obstinate, and in the last the stern fighter might have been
declaring, as in the following spring: "I propose to fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer."The eyes, first unveiled fully in this
fourth view, are the unmistakable index to Grant's stern inflexibility,
once his decision was made.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1864--AFTER THE STRAIN OF THE WILDERNESS
CAMPAIGN]

Here is a furrowed brow above eyes worn by pain.In the pictures of the
previous year the forehead is more smooth, the expression grave yet
confident.Here the expression is that of a man who has won, but won at a
bitter cost.It is the memory of the 50,000 men whom he left in the
Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor that has lined this brow, and
closed still tighter this inflexible mouth.Again, as in the series above,
the eyes are not revealed until the last picture.Then again flashes the
determination of a hero.The great general's biographers say that Grant
was a man of sympathy and infinite pity.It was the more difficult for
him, spurred on to the duty by grim necessity, to order forward the lines
in blue that withered, again and again, before the Confederate fire, but
each time weakened the attenuated line which confronted them.[Illustration: MEADE AND SEDGWICK--BEFORE THE ADVANCE THAT BROUGHT

John Sedgwick, commanding the Sixth Army Corps.He wears his familiar
round hat and is smiling.He was a great tease; evidently the performances
of the civilian who had brought his new-fangled photographic apparatus
into camp suggested a joke.A couple of months later, on the 9th of May,
Sedgwick again was jesting--before Spotsylvania Court House.McMahon of
his staff had begged him to avoid passing some artillery exposed to the
Confederate fire, to which Sedgwick had playfully replied, "McMahon, I
would like to know who commands this corps, you or I?"Then he ordered
some infantry before him to shift toward the right.Their movement drew
the fire of the Confederates.The lines were close together; the situation
tense.A sharpshooter's bullet whistled--Sedgwick fell.He was taken to
Meade's headquarters.The Army of the Potomac had lost another corps
commander, and the Union a brilliant and courageous soldier.[Illustration: SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

WHERE GRANT WANTED TO "FIGHT IT OUT"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]For miles around this quaint old village-pump surged the lines of two vast
contending armies, May 8-12, 1864.In this picture of only a few months
later, the inhabitants have returned to their accustomed quiet, although
the reverberations of battle have hardly died away.But on May 7th
Generals Grant and Meade, with their staffs, had started toward the little
courthouse.As they passed along the Brock Road in the rear of Hancock's
lines, the men broke into loud hurrahs.They saw that the movement was
still to be southward.But chance had caused Lee to choose the same
objective.Misinterpreting Grant's movement as a retreat upon
Fredericksburg, he sent Longstreet's corps, now commanded by Anderson, to
Spotsylvania.Chance again, in the form of a forest fire, drove Anderson
to make, on the night of May 7th, the march from the Wilderness that he
had been ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.On that day, while
Warren was contending with the forces of Anderson, Lee's whole army was
entrenching on a ridge around Spotsylvania Court House."Accident," says
Grant, "often decides the fate of battle."But this "accident" was one of
Lee's master moves.[Illustration: THE APEX OF THE BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]McCool's house, within the "Bloody Angle."The photographs were taken in
1864, shortly after the struggle of Spotsylvania Court House, and show the
old dwelling as it was on May 12th, when the fighting was at flood tide
all round it; and below, the Confederate entrenchments near that
blood-drenched spot.At a point in these Confederate lines in advance of
the McCool house, the entrenchments had been thrown forward like the
salient of a fort, and the wedge-shaped space within them was destined to
become renowned as the "Bloody Angle."The position was defended by the
famous "Stonewall Division" of the Confederates under command of General
Edward Johnson.It was near the scene of Upton's gallant charge on the
10th.Here at daybreak on May 12th the divisions of the intrepid Barlow
and Birney, sent forward by Hancock, stole a march upon the unsuspecting
Confederates.Leaping over the breastworks the Federals were upon them and
the first of the terrific hand-to-hand conflicts that marked the day
began.It ended in victory for Hancock's men, into whose hands fell 20
cannon, 30 standards and 4,000 prisoners, "the best division in the
Confederate army."[Illustration: CONFEDERATE ENTRENCHMENTS NEAR "BLOODY ANGLE"]

Flushed with success, the Federals pressed on to Lee's second line of
works, where Wilcox's division of the Confederates held them until
reenforcements sent by Lee from Hill and Anderson drove them back.On the
Federal side the Sixth Corps, with Upton's brigade in the advance, was
hurried forward to hold the advantage gained.But Lee himself was on the
scene, and the men of the gallant Gordon's division, pausing long enough
to seize and turn his horse, with shouts of "General Lee in the rear,"
hurtled forward into the conflict.In five separate charges by the
Confederates the fighting came to close quarters.With bayonets, clubbed
muskets, swords and pistols, men fought within two feet of one another on
either side of the entrenchments at "Bloody Angle" till night at last left
it in possession of the Federals.None of the fighting near Spotsylvania
Court House was inglorious.On the 10th, after a day of strengthening
positions on both sides, young Colonel Emory Upton of the 121st New York,
led a storming party of twelve regiments into the strongest of the
Confederate entrenchments.For his bravery Grant made him a
brigadier-general on the field.[Illustration: UNION ARTILLERY MASSING FOR THE ADVANCE THAT EWELL'S ATTACK
DELAYED THAT SAME AFTERNOON

BEVERLY HOUSE, MAY 18, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The artillery massing in the meadow gives to this view the interest of an
impending tragedy.In the foreground the officers, servants, and orderlies
of the headquarters mess camp are waiting for the command to strike their
tents, pack the wagons, and move on.But at the very time this photograph
was taken they should have been miles away.Grant had issued orders the
day before that should have set these troops in motion.However, the
Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These are some of the men for whom waiting women wept--the ones who never
came back.They belonged to Ewell's Corps, who attacked the Federal lines
so gallantly on May 18th.There may be some who will turn from this
picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

Tyler's division to put under ground the men they slew in the sharp battle
of May 18th, and here they are near Mrs.Allsop's barn digging the trench
to hide the dreadful work of bullet and shot and shell.No feeling of
bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]


[Illustration: THE REDOUBT THAT LEE LET GO

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This redoubt covered Taylor's Bridge, but its flanks were swept by
artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

ONE OF THE GRIM JOKES OF WAR AS PLAYED AT CHESTERFIELD BRIDGE, NORTH ANNA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The sign posted by the local authorities at Taylor's bridge, where the
Telegraph Road crosses the North Anna, was "Walk your horses."The wooden
structure was referred to by the military as Chesterfield bridge.Here
Hancock's Corps arrived toward evening of May 23d, and the Confederate
entrenchments, showing in the foreground, were seized by the old "Berry
Brigade."In the heat of the charge the Ninety-third New York carried
their colors to the middle of the bridge, driving off the Confederates
before they could destroy it.When the Federals began crossing next day
they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

terrible Wilderness campaign.The Sanitary Commission is visiting the
field hospital established near the Rappahannock River, a mile or so from
the heights, where lay at the same time the wounded from these terrific
conflicts.Although the work of this Commission was only supplementary
after 1862, they continued to supply many delicacies, and luxuries such as
crutches, which did not form part of the regular medical corps
paraphernalia.The effect of their work can be seen here, and also the
appearance of men after the shock of gunshot wounds.All injuries during
the war practically fell under three headings: incised and punctured
wounds, comprising saber cuts, bayonet stabs, and sword thrusts;
miscellaneous, from falls, blows from blunt weapons, and various
accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

COPYRIGHT 1911 PATRIOT PUB.This photograph of May 30, 1864, shows the Federal cavalry in actual
operation of a most important function--the "screening" of the army's
movements.The troopers are guarding the evacuation of Port Royal on the
Rappahannock, May 30, 1864.After the reverse to the Union arms at
Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

24th.Thus was completed the passage to the south of the stream of the two
wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The End of the Gray Line at Cold Harbor.Here at the extreme left of the
Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

[Illustration: WHERE TEN THOUSAND FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The battle of Cold Harbor on June 3d was the third tremendous engagement
of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Grant's assault at Cold Harbor was marked by the gallantry of General
Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the
concentrated artillery of the Confederates; they took the position and
held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

South including even New Orleans in times of peace.Here landed supplies
that kept an army numbering, with fighting force and supernumeraries,
nearly one hundred and twenty thousand well-supplied, well-fed,
well-contented, and well-munitioned men in the field.This was the
marvelous base--safe from attack, secure from molestation.It was meals

infinite relief that Grant saw the advance of the Army of the Potomac
reach this point on June 14th.His last flanking movement was an extremely
hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted
at Dalton.Sherman's cavalry forces under Stoneman and Garrard were not
yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The strong works in the pictures, commanding the railroad bridge over the
Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

speaks of the peculiarly depressing effect that the weather had upon his
troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also
General Wagner.[Illustration: FEDERAL ENTRENCHMENTS AT THE FOOT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN

took part in the operations about Marietta and against Kenesaw Mountain in
June and July.The
battery did not go into this campaign without previous experience.It had
already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

until he is actually farther from Atlanta than Sherman's right flank.Who
will reach the Chattahoochee first?There, if anywhere, Johnston must make
his stand; he must hold the fords and ferries, and the fortifications
that, with the wisdom of a far-seeing commander, he has for a long time
been preparing.The rustic work in the photograph, which embowers the
tents of the commanding general and his staff, is the sort of thing that
Civil War soldiers had learned to throw up within an hour after pitching
camp.[Illustration: PALISADES AND _CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE_ GUARDING ATLANTA

keypoints in the Confederate defense, the fort at the head of Marietta
Street, toward which the Federal lines were advancing from the northwest.The old Potter house in the background, once a quiet, handsome country
seat, is now surrounded by bristling fortifications, palisades, and double
lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A Federal picket post on the lines before Atlanta.This picture was taken
shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.It was Sherman's experienced railroad wreckers that finally drove Hood out
of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

Jonesboro and cut them off from returning to Atlanta.This was Hood's last
effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows
the Georgia Central Railroad east of the town.REPRESENTATIVE SOLDIERS FROM A DOZEN STATES

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At
Gettysburg, Colonel Cross commanded a brigade, which included the Fifth
New Hampshire, and was killed at the head of it near Devil's Den, on July
2, 1863.LEADERS IN SECURING VOLUNTEERS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

years of age when he made the brilliant Valley campaign of the summer of
1864, which was halted only by the superior forces of Sheridan.A West
Point graduate and a veteran of the Mexican War, Early became, after the
death of Jackson, one of Lee's most efficient subordinates.He was alert,
aggressive, resourceful.His very eccentricities, perhaps, made him all
the more successful as a commander of troops in the field."Old Jube's"
caustic wit and austere ways made him a terror to stragglers, and who

it was still an unfinished structure, betraying its incompleteness to
every beholder.This picture shows the derrick on the dome.It is a view
of the east front of the building and was taken on July 11, 1863.Washington society had not been wholly free from occasional "war scares"
since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

such an attack as Early might be expected to make.Not only were these
guns hard to move to points of danger, but in the summer of '64 there were
no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN

reason why Early did not make his approach to the capital from the

the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

INSIDE FORT TOTTEN--THREE SHIFTING SCENES IN A BIG-GUN DRILL

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

while Fort Sedgwick, which was no less active in reply, was known to the
Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the
Confederate line, is notable as the point in front of which General John

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911 PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WATERFRONT AT SAVANNAH, 1865

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Savannah was better protected by nature from attack by land or water than
any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

he ordered the garrison at Johnsonville, on the Tennessee, eighty miles

garrison at this same Johnsonville that, a month earlier, had been
frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

the two lines, separated by only fifty yards, sallies and counter-sallies
were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the

used by both besiegers and besieged along the lines south of the
Appomattox.Those shown in this picture were in front of the entrenchments
near Elliott's salient and show how effectually it was protected from any
attempt to storm the works by rushing tactics on the part of the Federal
infantry.Not far from here lies the excavation of the Crater.[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON, C. S.To this gallant young Georgia officer, just turned thirty-three at the
time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,

We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

THE PROFESSIONS.If what are called the liberal professions could speak, they would
all utter the one cry, “we are overstocked;” and echo would reply
“overstocked.” This has long been a subject of complaint, and yet nobody
seems inclined to mend the matter by making any sacrifice on his own
part--just as in a crowd, to use a familiar illustration, the man who is
loudest in exclaiming “dear me, what pressing and jostling people do keep
here!” never thinks of lightening the pressure by withdrawing his own
person from the mass.There is, however, an advantage to be derived from
the utterance and reiteration of the complaint, if not by those already
in the press, at least by those who are still happily clear of it.There are many “vanities and vexations of spirit” under the sun, but this
evil of professional redundancy seems to be one of very great magnitude.It involves not merely an outlay of much precious time and substance to
no purpose, but in most cases unfits those who constitute the “excess”
from applying themselves afterwards to other pursuits.Such persons are
the primary sufferers; but the community at large participates in the
loss.It cannot but be interesting to inquire to what this tendency may be
owing, and what remedy it might be useful to apply to the evil.Now, it
strikes me that the great cause is the exclusive attention which people
pay to the great prizes, and their total inconsideration of the number of
blanks which accompany them.Life itself has been compared to a lottery;
but in some departments the scheme may be so particularly bad, that it is
nothing short of absolute gambling to purchase a share in it.A few arrive at great eminence, and these few excite the
envy and admiration of all beholders; but they are only a few compared
with the number of those who linger in the shade, and, however anxious to
enjoy the sport, never once get a rap at the ball.Again, parents are apt to look upon the mere name of a profession as a
provision for their children.They calculate all the expenses of general
education, professional education, and then of admission to “liberty to
practise;” and finding all these items amount to a tolerably large sum,
they conceive they have bestowed an ample portion on the son who has cost
them “thus much monies.” But unfortunately they soon learn by experience
that the elevation of a profession, great as it is, does not always
possess that homely recommendation of causing the “pot to boil,” and that
the individual for whom this costly provision has been made, cannot be so
soon left to shift for himself.Here then is another cause of this evil,
namely, that people do not adequately and fairly calculate the whole cost.Of our liberal professions, the army is the only one that yields a
certain income as the produce of the purchase money, But in these “piping
times of peace,” a private soldier in the ranks might as well attempt to
verify the old song, and

    “Spend half a crown out of sixpence a-day,”

as an ensign to pay mess-money and band-money, and all other regulation
monies, keep himself in dress coat and epaulettes, and all the other et
ceteras, upon his mere pay.To live in any
comfort in the army, a subaltern should have an income from some other
source, equal at least in amount to that which he receives through the
hands of the paymaster.The army is, in fact, an expensive profession,
and of all others the least agreeable to one who is prevented, by
circumscribed means, from doing as his brother officers do.Yet the
mistake of venturing to meet all these difficulties is not unfrequently
admitted, with what vain expectation it is needless to inquire.The usual
result is such as one would anticipate, namely, that the rash adventurer,
after incurring debts, or putting his friends to unlooked-for charges, is
obliged after a short time to sell out, and bid farewell for ever to the
unprofitable profession of arms.It would be painful to dwell upon the situation of those who enter other
professions without being duly prepared to wait their turn of employment.It is recognised as a poignantly applicable truth in the profession of
the bar, that “many are called but few are chosen;” but with very few and
rare exceptions indeed, the necessity of _biding_ the time is certain.In the legal and medical professions there is no fixed income, however
small, insured to the adventurer; and unless his circle of friends and
connections be very wide and serviceable indeed, he should make up his
mind for a procrastinated return and a late harvest.But how many from
day to day, and from year to year, do launch their bark upon the ocean,
without any such prudent foresight!The result therefore is, that vast
proportion of disastrous voyages and shipwrecks of which we hear so
constantly.Such is the admitted evil--it is granted on all sides.The question
is, what is to be done?--what is the remedy?Now, the remedy for an
overstocked profession very evidently is, that people should forbear to
enter it.I am no Malthusian on the subject of population: I desire no
unnatural checks upon the increase and multiplication of her Majesty’s
subjects; but I should like to drain off a surplus from certain
situations, and turn off the in-flowing stream into more profitable
channels.I would advise parents, then, to leave the choice of a liberal
profession to those who are able to live without one.Such parties can
afford to wait for advancement, however long it may be in coming, or to
bear up against disappointment, if such should be their lot.With such
it is a safe speculation, and they may be left to indulge in it, if they
think proper.But it will be asked, what is to
be done with the multitudes who would be diverted from the professions,
if this advice were acted upon?I answer, that the money unprofitably
spent upon their education, and in fees of admission to these expensive
pursuits, would insure them a “good location” and a certain provision
for life in Canada, or some of the colonies; and that any honourable
occupation which would yield a competency ought to be preferred to
“professions” which, however “liberal,” hold out to the many but a very
doubtful prospect of that result.It is much to be regretted that there is a prevalent notion among
certain of my countrymen that “trade” is not a “genteel” thing, and
that it must be eschewed by those who have any pretensions to fashion.This unfortunate, and I must say unsound state of opinion, contributes
also, I fear, in no small degree, to that professional redundancy of
which we have been speaking.The supposed absolute necessity of a high
classical education is a natural concomitant of this opinion.All our
schools therefore are eminently classical.The University follows, as a
matter of course, and then the University leads to a liberal profession,
as surely as one step of a ladder conducts to another.Thus the evil is
nourished at the very root.Now, I would take the liberty of advising
those parents who may concur with me in the main point of over-supply in
the professions, to begin at the beginning, and in the education of their
children, to exchange this superabundance of Greek and Latin for the less
elegant but more useful accomplishment of “ciphering.” I am disposed to
concur with that facetious but shrewd fellow, Mr Samuel Slick, upon the
inestimable advantages of that too much neglected art--neglected, I mean,
in our country here, Ireland.He has demonstrated that they do every
thing by it in the States, and that without it they could do nothing.With the most profound respect to my countrymen, then, I would earnestly
recommend them to cultivate it.But it may perhaps be said that there is
no encouragement to mercantile pursuits in Ireland, and that if there
were, there would be no necessity for me to recommend “ciphering” and
its virtues to the people.To this I answer, that merchandize offers
its prizes to the ingenious and venturous much rather than to those who
wait for a “highway” to be made for them.If people were resolved to
live by trade, I think they would contrive to do so--many more, at least,
than at present operate successfully in that department.If more of
education, and more of mind, were turned in that direction, new sources
of profitable industry, at present unthought of, would probably discover
themselves.Much might be said on this subject, but I shall not enter
further into the speculation, quite satisfied if I have thrown out a hint
which may be found capable of improvement by others.The rearing of geese might be more an object of attention to our small
farmers and labourers in the vicinity of bogs and mountain tracts than it
is.The general season for the consumption of fat geese is from Michaelmas to
Christmas, and the high prices paid for them in the English markets--to
which they can be so rapidly conveyed from many parts of Ireland--appear
to offer sufficient temptation to the speculator who has the capital and
accommodation necessary for fattening them.A well-organized system of feeding this hardy and nutritious species of
poultry, in favourable localities, would give a considerable impulse to
the rearing of them, and consequently promote the comforts of many poor
Irish families, who under existing circumstances do not find it worth
while to rear them except in very small numbers.I am led to offer a few suggestions on this subject from having
ascertained that in the Fens of Lincolnshire, notwithstanding a great
decrease there in the breeding of geese from extensive drainage, one
individual, Mr Clarke of Boston, fattens every year, between Michaelmas
and Christmas, the prodigious number of seven thousand geese, and that
another dealer at Spalding prepares for the poultry butcher nearly as
many: these they purchase in lots from the farmers’ wives.Perhaps a few details of the Lincolnshire practice may be acceptable to
some of the readers of this Journal:--

The farmers in the Fens keep breeding stocks proportioned to the extent
of suitable land which they can command; and in order to insure the
fertility of the eggs, they allow one gander to three geese, which is a
higher proportion of males than is deemed necessary elsewhere.The number
of goslings in each brood averages about ten, which, allowing for all
casualties, is a considerable produce.There have been extraordinary instances of individual fecundity, on
which, however, it would be as absurd for any goose-breeder to calculate,
as it is proverbially unwise to reckon chickens before they are hatched;
and this fruitfulness is only attainable by constant feeding with
stimulating food through the preceding winter.A goose has been known to lay seventy eggs within twelve months,
twenty-six in the spring, before the time of incubation, and (after
bringing out seventeen goslings) the remainder by the end of the year.The white variety is preferred to the grey or party-, as the
birds of this colour feed more kindly, and their feathers are worth three
shillings a stone more than the others: the quality of the land, however,
on which the breeding stock is to be maintained, decides this matter,
generally strong land being necessary for the support of the white or
larger kind.Under all circumstances a white gander is preferred, in
order to have a large progeny.It has been remarked, but I know not if
with reason, that ganders are more frequently white than the females.To state all the particulars of hatching and rearing would be
superfluous, and mere repetition of what is contained in the various
works on poultry.I shall merely state some of the peculiarities of the
practice in the county of Lincoln.When the young geese are brought up at different periods by the great
dealers, they are put into pens together, according to their age, size,
and condition, and fed on steamed potatoes and ground oats, in the ratio
of one measure of oats to three of potatoes.By unremitting care as to
cleanliness, pure water, and constant feeding, these geese are fattened
in about three weeks, at an average cost of one penny per day each.The _cramming_ system, either by the fingers or the forcing pump,
described by French writers, with the accompanying barbarities of
blinding, nailing the feet to the floor, or confinement in perforated
casks or earthen pots (as is said to be the case sometimes in Poland),
are happily unknown in Lincolnshire, and I may add throughout England,
with one exception--the nailing of the feet to boards.The unequivocal
proofs of this may occasionally, but very rarely, be seen in the geese
brought into the London markets: these, however, may possibly be imported
ones, though I fear they are not so.The Lincolnshire dealers do not give any of those rich greasy pellets
of barley meal and hot liquor, which always spoil the flavour, to their
geese, as they well know that oats is the best feeding for them; barley,
besides being more expensive, renders the flesh loose and insipid, and
rather _chickeny_ in flavour.Every point of economy on this subject is matter of great moment, on the
vast scale pursued by Mr Clarke, who pays seven hundred pounds a-year
for the mere conveyance of his birds to the London market; a fact which
gives a tolerable notion of the great extent of capital employed in this
business, the extent of which is scarcely conceivable by my agricultural
countrymen.Little cost, however, is incurred by those who breed the geese, as the
stock are left to provide for themselves, except in the laying season,
and in feeding the goslings until they are old enough to eat grass or
feed on the stubbles.I have no doubt, however, that the cramp would be
less frequently experienced, if solid food were added to the grass, when
the geese are turned out to graze, although Mr Clarke attributes the
cramp, as well as gout and fever, to too close confinement alone.This
opinion does not correspond with my far more limited observation, which
leads me to believe that the cramp attacks goslings most frequently when
they are at large, and left to shift for themselves on green food alone,
and that of the poorest kind.I should think it good economy to give
them, and the old stagers too, all spare garden vegetables, for loss of
condition is prejudicial to them as well as to other animals.Mr Cobbett
used to fatten his young geese, from June to October, on Swedish turnips,
carrots, white cabbages, or lettuces, with some corn.Swedish turnips no doubt will answer very well, but not so well as
farinaceous potatoes, when immediate profit is the object.The experience
of such an extensive dealer as Mr Clarke is worth volumes of theory
and conjecture as to the mode of feeding, and he decides in favour of
potatoes and oats.The treatment for cramp and fever in Lincolnshire is bleeding--I know not
if it be hazarded in gout--but as it is not successful in the cases of
cramp in one instance out of twenty, it may be pronounced inefficacious.I have had occasion lately to remark in this Journal on the general
disinclination in England to the barbarous custom of plucking geese
alive.In Lincolnshire, however, they do so with the breeding stock three
times in the year, beginning at midsummer, and repeating the operation
twice afterwards, at intervals of six weeks between the operations.The practice is defended on the plea, that if the feathers be matured,
the geese are better for it, while it is of course admitted that the
birds must be injured more or less--according to the handling by the
pluckers--if the feathers be not ripe.But as birds do not moult three
times in the year, I do not understand how it should be correctly said
that the feathers _can_ be ripe on these three occasions.How does nature
suggest the propriety of stripping the feathers so often?Where great
numbers are kept, the loss by allowing the feathers to drop on the ground
would be serious, and on this account alone can even one stripping be
justified.In proof of the general opinion that the goose is extremely long-lived,
we have many recorded facts; among them the following:--“In 1824 there
was a goose living in the possession of Mr Hewson of Glenham, near
Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which was then upwards of a century old.It
had been throughout that term in the constant possession of Mr Hewson’s
forefathers and himself, and on quitting his farm he would not suffer
it to be sold with his other stock, but made a present of it to the
in-coming tenant, that the venerable fowl might terminate its career on
the spot where its useful life had been spent such a length of days.”

The taste which has long prevailed among gourmands for the liver of a
goose, and has led to the enormous cruelties exercised in order to cause
its enlargement by rendering the bird diseased in that organ through high
and forced feeding in a warm temperature and close confinement, is well
known; but I doubt if many are aware of the influence of _charcoal_ in
producing an unnatural state of the liver.I had read of charcoal being put into a trough of water to sweeten it for
geese when cooped up; but from a passage in a recent work by Liebig it
would appear that the charcoal acts not as a sweetener of the water, but
in another way on the constitution of the goose.I am tempted to give the extract from its novelty:--“The production of
flesh and fat may be artificially increased: all domestic animals, for
example, contain much fat.We give food to animals which increases the
activity of certain organs, and is itself capable of being transformed
into fat.We add to the quantity of food, or we lessen the progress
of respiration and perspiration by preventing motion.The conditions
necessary to effect this purpose in birds are different from those in
quadrupeds; and it is well known that charcoal powder produces such an
excessive growth in the liver of a goose as at length causes the death of
the animal.”

We are much inferior to the English in the art of preparing poultry for
the market; and this is the more to be regretted in the instance of
geese, especially as we can supply potatoes--which I have shown to be
the chief material of their fattening food--at half their cost in many
parts of England.This advantage alone ought to render the friends of our
agricultural poor earnest in promoting the rearing and fattening of geese
in localities favourable for the purpose.The encouragement of our native manufactures is now a general topic of
conversation and interest, and we hope the present excitement of the
public mind on this subject will be productive of permanent good.We also
hope that the encouragement proposed to be given to articles of Irish
manufacture will be extended to the productions of the head as well as to
those of the hands; that the manufacturer of Irish wit and humour will be
deemed worthy of support as well as those of silks, woollens, or felts;
and, that Irishmen shall venture to estimate the value of Irish produce
for themselves, without waiting as heretofore till they get “the London
stamp” upon them, as our play-going people of old times used to do in the
case of the eminent Irish actors.We are indeed greatly inclined to believe that our Irish manufactures
are rising in estimation in England, from the fact which has come to
our knowledge that many thousands of our Belfast hams are sold annually
at the other side of the water as genuine Yorkshire, and also that many
of those Belfast hams with the Yorkshire stamp find their way back into
“Ould Ireland,” and are bought as English by those who would despise
them as Irish.Now, we should like our countrymen not to be gulled in
this way, but depend upon their own judgment in the matter of hams, and
in like manner in the matter of articles of Irish literary manufacture,
without waiting for the London stamp to be put on them.The necessity
for such discrimination and confidence in their own judgment exists
equally in hams and literature.Thus certain English editors approve so
highly of our articles in the Irish Penny Journal, that they copy them
by wholesale, not only without acknowledgment, but actually do us the
favour to father them as their own!As an example of this patronage, we
may refer to a recent number of the Court Gazette, in which its editor
has been entertaining his aristocratic readers with a little piece of
_badinage_ from our Journal, expressly written for us, and entitled “A
short chapter on Bustles,” but which he gives as written for the said
Court Gazette!Now, this is really very considerate and complimentary,
and we of course feel grateful.But, better again, we find our able and
kind friend the editor of the _Monitor_ and _Irishman_, presenting, no
doubt inadvertently, this very article to his Irish readers a few weeks
ago--not even as an Irish article that had got the London stamp upon it,
but as actually one of true British manufacture--the produce of the Court
Gazette.Now, in perfect good humour, we ask our friend, as such we have reason to
consider him, could he not as well have copied this article from our own
Journal, and given us the credit of it--and would it not be worthy of the
consistency and patriotism of the _Irishman_, who writes so ably in the
cause of Irish manufactures, to extend his support, as far as might be
compatible with truth and honesty, to the native literature of Ireland?*       *       *       *       *

again, do not, I pray you, forget that I treated you politely when you

There is no saying more degrading than this: "It is better to be the
tail of a lion than the head of a dog."It is a responsibility to think
and act for yourself.Most people hate responsibility; therefore they
join something and become the tail of some lion.They say, "My party
can act for me--my church can do my thinking.It is enough for me to
pay taxes and obey the lion to which I belong, without troubling myself
about the right, the wrong, or the why or the wherefore."While the Preachers Talked the People Slept

The fact is, the old ideas became a little monotonous to the people.The
fall of man, the scheme of redemption and irresistible grace, began
to have a familiar sound.The preachers told the old stories while the
congregations slept.Some of the ministers became tired of these stories
themselves.The five points grew dull, and they felt that nothing short
of irresistible grace could bear this endless repetition.The outside
world was full of progress, and in every direction men advanced, while
the church, anchored to a creed, idly rotted at the shore.Christianity no Friend to Progress

Christianity has always opposed every forward movement of the human
race.Across the highway of progress it has always been building
breastworks of bibles, tracts, commentaries, prayer-books, creeds,
dogmas and platforms, and at every advance the Christians have gathered
together behind these heaps of rubbish and shot the poisoned arrows of
malice at the soldiers of freedom.You may be laughed at in this world for insisting that God put Adam into
a deep sleep and made a woman out of one of his ribs, but you will be
crowned and glorified in the next.You will also have the pleasure of
hearing the gentlemen howl there, who laughed at you here.While you
will not be permitted to take any revenge, you will be allowed to
smilingly express your entire acquiescence in the will of God.The one was lost, and the other has not
been found.The Real Eden is Beyond

Nations and individuals fail and die, and make room for higher forms.The intellectual horizon of the world widens as the centuries pass.Ideals grow grander and purer; the difference between justice and mercy
becomes less and less; liberty enlarges, and love intensifies as the
years sweep on.The ages of force and fear, of cruelty and wrong, are
behind us and the real Eden is beyond.It is said that a desire for
knowledge lost us the Eden of the past; but whether that is true or not,
it will certainly give us the Eden of the future.Party Names Belittle Men

Let us forget that we are Baptists, Methodists, Catholics,
Presbyterians, or Free-thinkers, and remember only that we are men and
women.After all, man and woman are the highest possible titles.All
other names belittle us, and show that we have, to a certain extent,
given up our individuality.A FEW PLAIN QUESTIONS




507.On which of the six days was he
created?Is it possible that God would make a successful
rival?He must have known that Adam and Eve would fall.He knew what
a snake with a "spotted, dappled skin" could do with an inexperienced
woman.He knew that if the serpent
got into the garden, Adam and Eve would sin, that he would have to drive
them out, that afterwards the world would be destroyed, and that he
himself would die upon the cross.Must We Believe Fables to be Good and True?Must we, in order to be
good, gentle and loving in our lives, believe that the creation of woman
was a second thought?That Jehovah really endeavored to induce Adam to
take one of the lower animals as an helpmeet for him?After all, is it
not possible to live honest and courageous lives without believing these
fables?Why was not the serpent kept out of the garden?Why did not the Lord God
take him by the tail and snap his head off?Why did he not put Adam
and Eve on their guard about this serpent?They, of course, were not
acquainted in the neighborhood, and knew nothing about the serpent's
reputation.Questions About the Ark

How was the ark kept clean?We know how it was ventilated; but what
was done with the filth?How were some
portions of the ark heated for animals from the tropics, and others
kept cool for the polar bears?How did the animals get back to their
respective countries?Some had to creep back about six thousand miles,
and they could only go a few feet a day.Some of the creeping things
must have started for the ark just as soon as they were made, and kept
up a steady jog for sixteen hundred years.Think of a couple of the
slowest snails leaving a point opposite the ark and starting for the
plains of Shinar, a distance of twelve thousand miles.Going at the rate
rate of a mile a month, it would take them a thousand years.Polar bears must have gone several thousand miles, and
so sudden a change in climate must have been exceedingly trying upon
their health.Of course, all the polar
bears did not go.It could be confounded only by the
destruction of memory.Did God destroy the memory of mankind at
that time, and if so, how?Did he paralyze that portion of the brain
presiding over the organs of articulation, so that they could not speak
the words, although they remembered them clearly, or did he so touch
the brain that they could not hear?Will some theologian, versed in
the machinery of the miraculous, tell us in what way God confounded the
language of mankind?Would God Kill a Man for Making Ointment?Can we believe that the real God, if there is one, ever ordered a man
to be killed simply for making hair oil, or ointment?We are told in
the thirtieth chapter of Exodus, that the Lord commanded Moses to take
myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, cassia, and olive oil, and make a
holy ointment for the purpose of anointing the tabernacle, tables,
candlesticks and other utensils, as well as Aaron and his sons; saying,
at the same time, that whosoever compounded any like it, or whoever put
any of it on a stranger, should be put to death.In the same chapter,
the Lord furnishes Moses with a recipe for making a perfume, saying,
that whoever should make any which smelled like it, should be cut off
from his people.This, to me, sounds so unreasonable that I cannot
believe it.Some Christians say that the fountains of the great deep were broken up.Will they be kind enough to tell us what the fountains of the great deep
are?Others say that God had vast stores of water in the center of the
earth that he used on the occasion of the flood.How did these waters
happen to run up hill?Would a Real God Uphold Slavery?Must we believe that God called some of his children the money of
others?Can we believe that God made lashes upon the naked back, a
legal tender for labor performed?Must we regard the auction block as an
altar?Were the
stealers and whippers of babes and women the justified children of God?Will some minister, who now believes in religious liberty, and
eloquently denounces the intolerance of Catholicism, explain these
things; will he tell us why he worships an intolerant God?Is a god who
will burn a soul forever in another world, better than a christian who
burns the body for a few hours in this?Do the angels all discuss questions on the same side?Are all the
investigators in perdition?Will the penitent thief, winged and crowned,
laugh at the honest folks in hell?Will the agony of the damned increase
or decrease the happiness of God?Will there be, in the universe, an
eternal _auto da fe_?Why should a believer in God hate an atheist?Surely the atheist has
not injured God, and surely he is human, capable of joy and pain, and
entitled to all the rights of man.Would it not be far better to treat
this atheist, at least, as well as he treats us?ORIENT PEARLS AS RANDOM STRUNG

I do not believe that Christians are as bad as their creeds.The highest crime against a creed is to change it.A believer is a bird in a cage, a free-thinker is an eagle parting the
clouds with tireless wing.All that is good in our civilization is the result of commerce, climate,
soil, geographical position.The heretics have not thought and suffered and died in vain.Every
heretic has been, and is, a ray of light.No man ever seriously attempted to reform a Church without being cast
out and hunted down by the hounds of hypocrisy.After all, the poorest bargain that a human being can make, is to give
his individuality for what is called respectability.On every hand are the enemies of individuality and mental freedom.Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.There can be nothing more utterly subversive of all that is really
valuable than the suppression of honest thought.No man, worthy of the form he bears, will at the command of Church or
State solemnly repeat a creed his reason scorns.Although we live in what is called a free government,--and politically
we are free,--there is but little religious liberty in America.According to orthodox logic, God having furnished us with imperfect
minds, has a right to demand a perfect result.Nearly all people stand in great horror of annihilation, and yet to give
up your individuality is to annihilate yourself.When women reason, and babes sit in the lap of philosophy, the victory
of reason over the shadowy host of darkness will be complete.Of all the religions that have been produced by the egotism, the malice,
the ignorance and ambition of man, Presbyterianism is the most hideous.And what man who really thinks can help repeating the words of Ennius:
"If there are gods they certainly pay no attention to the affairs of
man."Events, like the pendulum of a clock have swung forward and backward,
but after all, man, like the hands, has gone steadily on.In spite of Church and dogma, there have been millions and millions of
men and women true to the loftiest and most generous promptings of the
human heart.I was taught to hate Catholicism with every drop of my blood, it is only
justice to say, that in all essential particulars it is precisely the
same as every other religion.Wherever brave blood has been shed, the sword of the Church has been
wet.On every chain has been the sign of the cross.The altar and throne
have leaned against and supported each other.We have all been taught by the Church that nothing is so well calculated
to excite the ire of the Deity as to express a doubt as to his
existence, and that to deny it is an unpardonable sin.Universal obedience is universal stagnation; disobedience is one of the
conditions of progress.Select any age of the world and tell me what
would have been the effect of implicit obedience.We have no national religion, and no national God; but every citizen
is allowed to have a religion and a God of his own, or to reject all
religions and deny the existence of all gods.Whatever may be the truth upon any subject has nothing to do with our
right to investigate that subject, and express any opinion we may form.All that I ask, is the same right I freely accord to all others.Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his
intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.In this
sense, every church is a cemetery and every creed an epitaph.Think of reading the 109th Psalm to a heathen who has a Bible of his own
in which is found this passage: "Blessed is the man and beloved of all
the gods, who is afraid of no man, and of whom no man is afraid."The trouble with most people is, they bow to what is called authority;
they have a certain reverence for the old because it is old.They think
a man is better for being dead, especially if he has been dead a long
time.We should all remember that to be like other people is to be unlike
ourselves, and that nothing can be more detestable in character than
servile imitation.The great trouble with imitation is, that we are apt
to ape those who are in reality far below us.Suppose the Church had had absolute control of the human mind at any
time, would not the words liberty and progress have been blotted from
human speech?In defiance of advice, the world has advanced.Over every fortress of tyranny has waved, and still waves, the banner of
the Church.The Church has won no victories for the rights of man.We have advanced in spite of religious zeal, ignorance, and opposition.Luther labored to reform the Church--Voltaire, to reform men.There have been, and still are, too many men who own themselves--too
much thought, too much knowledge for the Church to grasp again the
sword of power.For the Eg-lon of superstition
Science has a message from Truth.It is a blessed thing that in every age some one has had individuality
enough and courage enough to stand by his own convictions,--some one
who had the grandeur to say his say."The Church says the earth is flat; but I have seen its shadow on the
moon, and I have more confidence even in a shadow than in the Church.""On the prow of his ship were disobedience, defiance, scorn, and
success.INGERSOLL'S ORATION AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE

     A Tribute to Ebon C. Ingersoll, by his Brother
     Robert--The Record of a Generous Life Runs
     Like a  Vine Around the Memory of our
     Dead,   and   Every   Sweet,   Unselfish
     Act is Now a Perfumed Flower.Dear Friends: I am going to do that which the dead oft promised he would
do for me.The loved and loving brother, husband, father, friend, died where
manhood's morning almost touches noon, and while the shadows still were
falling toward the west.He had not passed on life's highway the stone that marks the highest
point; but, being weary for a moment, he lay down by the wayside, and,
using his burden for a pillow, fell into that dreamless sleep that
kisses down his eyelids still.While yet in love with life and raptured
with the world, he passed to silence and pathetic dust.Yet, after all, it may be best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour
of all the voyage, while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash
against the unseen rock, and in an instant hear the billows roar above a
sunken ship For whether in mid sea or '<DW41> the breakers of the farther
shore, a wreck at last must mark the end of each and all.And every
life, no matter if its every hour is rich with love and every moment
jeweled with a joy, will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep
and dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery and death.This brave and tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock; but
in the sunshine he was vine and flower.He was the friend of all heroic
souls.He climbed the heights, and left all superstitions far below,
while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of the grander day.He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form, and music touched to
tears.He sided with the weak, the poor, and wronged, and lovingly
gave alms.With loyal heart and with the purest hands he faithfully
discharged all public trusts.He was a worshiper of liberty, a friend of the oppressed.A thousand
times I have heard him quote these words: "For Justice all place a
temple, and all season, summer."He believed that happiness was the only
good, reason the only torch, justice the only worship, humanity the only
religion, and love the only priest.He added to the sum of human joy;
and were every one to whom he did some loving service to bring a blossom
to his grave, he would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of sweet
flowers.Life is a narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
eternities.We strive in vain to look beyond the heights.We cry aloud,
and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.From the voiceless
lips of the unreplying dead there comes no word; but in the night of
death hope sees a star and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.He who sleeps here, when dying, mistaking the approach of death for the
return of health, whispered with his latest breath, "I am better now."Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, of fears and tears, that
these dear words are true of all the countless dead.And now, to you, who have been chosen, from among the many men he loved,
to do the last sad office for the dead, we give his sacred dust.There was, there is, no gentler,
stronger, manlier man.INGERSOLL'S DREAM OF THE WAR

     The Following Words of Matchless Eloquence were
     Addressed by Col.Ingersoll to the Veteran
     Soldiers of Indianapolis.The past, as it were, rises before me like a dream.Again we are in the
great struggle for national life.We hear the sound of preparation--the
music of the boisterous drums--the silver voices of heroic bugles.We
see thousands of assemblages, and hear the appeals of orators; we see
the pale cheeks of women, and the flushed faces of men; and in those
assemblages we see all the dead whose dust we have covered with flowers.We are with them when they enlist in the
great army of freedom.Some are
walking for the last time in quiet, woody places with the maidens they
adore.We hear the whisperings and the sweet vows of eternal love as
they lingeringly part forever.Others are bending over cradles kissing
babes that are asleep.Some are parting with
mothers who hold them and press them to their hearts again and again,
and say nothing; and some are talking with wives, and endeavoring with
brave words spoken in the old tones to drive away the awful fear.We see the wife standing in the door with the babe in her
arms--standing in the sunlight sobbing--at the turn of the road a hand
waves--she answers by holding high in her loving hands the child.We see them all as they march proudly away under the flaunting flags,
keeping time to the wild music of war--marching down the streets of the
great cities--through the towns and across the prairies--down to the
fields of glory, and do and to die for the eternal right.We are by their side on all the gory
fields, in all the hospitals of pain--on all the weary marches.We stand
guard with them in the wild storm and under the quiet stars.We are with
them in ravines running with blood--in the furrows of old fields.We are
with them between contending hosts, unable to move, wild with thirst,
the life ebbing slowly away among the withered leaves.We see them
pierced by balls and torn with shells in the trenches of forts, and in
the whirlwind of the charge, where men become iron with nerves of steel.We are with them in the prisons of hatred and famine, but human speech
can never tell what they endured.We are at home when the news comes that they are dead.We see the maiden
in the shadow of her sorrow.We see the silvered head of the old man
bowed with the last grief.The past rises before us, and we see four millions of human beings
governed by the lash--we see them bound hand and foot--we hear the
strokes of cruel whips--we see the hounds tracking women through
tangled swamps.We see babes sold from the breasts of mothers.Four million bodies in chains--four million souls in fetters.All the
sacred relations of wife, mother, father and child trampled beneath the
brutal feet of might.All this was done under our own beautiful banner
of the free.We hear the roar and shriek of the bursting
shell.Instead of
slaves we see men and women and children.The wand of progress touches
the auction-block, the slave-pen, and the whipping-post, and we see
homes and firesides, and school-houses and books, and where all was want
and crime, and cruelty and fear, we see the faces of the free.They died for liberty--they died for us.They
are at rest, They sleep in the land they made free, under the flag
they rendered stainless, under the solemn pines, the sad hemlocks, the
tearful willows, the embracing vines.They sleep beneath the shadows of
the clouds, careless alike of sunshine or storm, each in the window-less
palace of rest.Earth may run red with other wars--they are at peace.In
the midst of battle, in the roar of conflict, they found the serenity of
death.I have one sentiment for the soldiers living and dead--cheers for
the living and tears for the dead.It is not necessary to be a pig in order to raise one.A blow from a parent leaves a scar on the soul of the child.A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.Agriculture is the basis of all wealth.It is better to be a whole farmer than part of a mechanic.One good school-master is worth a thousand priests.Out in the intellectual sea there is room for every sail.An honest God is the noblest work of man.A King is a non-producing thief, sitting on a throne, surrounded by
vermin.Whiskey is the son of villainies, the father of all crimes, the mother
of all abominations, the devil's best friend, and God's worst enemy.An Orthodox Man is a gentleman petrified in his mind.Chicago is a marvel of energy, a miracle of nerva

The Pulpit is a pillory.Civilization is the Child of Forethought

Prejudice is the Child of Ignorance.I believe in the democracy of the fireside, in the republicanism of the
home.I believe in truth, in
investigation, in forethought.I believe in the gospel of education, of cheerfulness, of justice and
intelligence.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks
and pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to
obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of
Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow
had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result
that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the
attack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men
south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and
ammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote
encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at
Lacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met
with greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in
the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a
brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove
them from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the
border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as
well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used
in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of
ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two
were killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of
communications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the
same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on
Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and
volunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on
Odelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand
men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived
at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about
two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting
field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no
difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself
proved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force
at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by
means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three
days before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to
the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from
behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;
'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,
praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many
saints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the
fighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men
had been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement
lasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church
made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were
beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the
Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The
rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch
and rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were
serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many
wounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and
one officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable
force, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were
still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of
troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported
to be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,
where a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight
resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry
volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of
Royal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,
did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

     By William Wood.THE RAILWAY BUILDERS
     By Oscar D. Skelton.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

Water tanks are here very necessary, because the country has no fresh
water rivers, and the water for the cultivation of lands is that which
is collected during the rainfall.Some wealthy and influential natives
contrived to take possession of the tanks during the time the Company
sold lands, with a view of thus having power over their neighbours
and of forcing them to deliver up to them a large proportion of their
harvests.They had to do this if they wished to obtain water for
the cultivation of their fields, and were compelled thus to buy at
high price that which comes as a blessing from the Lord to all men,
plants, and animals in general.His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then
Governor of Ceylon, issued an order in June, 1687, on his visit to
this Commandement, that for these reasons no tanks should be private
property, but should be left for common use, the owners being paid
by those who require to water their fields as much as they could
prove to have spent on these tanks.I found that this good order
has not been carried out, because the family of Sangere Pulle alone
possesses at present three such tanks, one of which is the property
of Moddely Tamby.Before my departure to Colombo I had ordered that
it should be given over to the surrounding landowners, who at once
offered to pay the required amount, but I heard on my return that
the conveyance had not been made yet by that unbearably proud and
obstinate Bellale caste, they being encouraged by the way their patron
Moddely Tamby had been favoured in Colombo, and the Commandeur is
not even recognized and his orders are passed by.Your Honours must
therefore see that my instructions with regard to these tanks are
carried out, and that they are paid for by those interested, or that
they are otherwise confiscated, in compliance with the Instructions
of 1687 mentioned above, which Instructions may be found among the
papers in the Mallabaar language kept by the schoolmasters of the
parishes.Considering that many of the Instructions are preserved in
the native language only, they ought to be collected and translated
into our Dutch language.[69]

The public roads must be maintained at a certain breadth, and the
natives are obliged to keep them in order.But their meanness and
impudence is so great that they have gradually, year by year, extended
the fences along their lands on to these roads, thus encroaching
upon the high road.They see more and more that land is valuable on
account of the harvests, and therefore do not leave a foot of ground
uncultivated when the time of the rainy season is near.This is quite
different from formerly; so much so, that the lands are worth not
only thrice but about four or five times as much as formerly.This
may be seen when the lands are sold by public auction, and it may
be also considered whether the people of Jaffnapatam are really so
badly off as to find it necessary to agitate for an abatement of the
tithes.The Dessave must therefore see that these roads are extended
again to their original breadth and condition, punishing those who
may have encroached on the roads.[70]

The Company's elephant stalls have been allowed to fall into decay
like the churches, and they must be repaired as soon as possible,
which is also a matter within the province of the Dessave.[71]

Great expectations were cherished by some with regard to the thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Besoar stones, Carret, and tusks from the
elephants that died in the Company's stalls, but experience did
not justify these hopes.As these points have been dealt with in the
Compendium of November 26, 1693, by Commandeur Blom, I would here refer
to that document.I cannot add anything to what is stated there.[72]

The General Paresse is a ceremony which the Mudaliyars, Collectors,
Majoraals, Aratchchies, &c., have to perform twice a year on behalf
of the whole community, appearing together before the Commandeur in
the fort.This is an obligation to which they have been subject from
heathen times, partly to show their submission, partly to report on
the condition of the country, and partly to give them an opportunity
to make any request for the general welfare.As this Paresse tends
to the interest of the Company as Sovereign Power on the one hand
and to that of the inhabitants on the other hand, the custom must be
kept up.When the Commandeur is absent at the time of this Paresse
Your Honours could meet together and receive the chiefs.It is held
once during the northern and once during the southern monsoon, without
being bound to any special day, as circumstances may require it to be
held earlier or later.During my absence the day is to be fixed by the
Dessave, as land regent.Any proposal made by the native chiefs must
be carefully written down by the Secretary, so that it may be possible
to send a report of it to His Excellency the Governor and the Council
if it should be of importance.All transactions must be carefully
noted down and inserted in the journal, so that it may be referred to
whenever necessary.The practice introduced by the Onderkoopman William
de Ridder in Manaar of requiring the Pattangatyns from the opposite
coast to attend not twice but twelve times a year or once a month is
unreasonable, and the people have rightly complained thereof.De Ridder also appointed
a second Cannekappul, which seems quite unnecessary, considering the
small amount of work to be done there for the natives.Jeronimo could
be discharged and Gonsalvo retained, the latter having been specially
sent from Calpentyn by His Excellency Governor Thomas van Rhee and
being the senior in the service.Of how little consequence the work
at Manaar was considered by His Excellency Governor van Mydregt may
be seen from the fact that His Excellency ordered that no Opperhoofd
should be stationed there nor any accounts kept, but that the fort
should be commanded by an Ensign as chief of the military.A second
Cannekappul is therefore superfluous, and the Company could be saved
the extra expense.[73]

I could make reference to a large number of other matters, but it
would be tedious to read and remember them all.I will therefore now
leave in Your Honours' care the government of a Commandement from which
much profit may be derived for the Company, and where the inhabitants,
though deceitful, cunning, and difficult to rule, yet obey through
fear; as they are cowardly, and will do what is right more from fear of
punishment than from love of righteousness.I hope that Your Honours
may have a more peaceful time than I had, for you are well aware
how many difficulties, persecutions, and public slights I have had to
contend with, and how difficult my government was through these causes,
and through continual indisposition, especially of late.However,
Jaffnapatam has been blessed by God during that period, as may be seen
from what has been stated in this Memoir.I hope that Your Honours'
dilligence and experience may supplement the defects in this Memoir,
and, above all, that you will try to live and work together in harmony,
for in that way the Company will be served best.There are people who
will purposely cause dissension among the members of the Council,
with a view to further their own ends or that of some other party,
much to the injury of the person who permits them to do so.[74]

The Political Council consists at present of the following members:--


Ryklof de Bitter, Dessave, Opperkoopman.Abraham M. Biermans, Administrateur.Pieter Boscho, Onderkoopman, Store- and Thombo-keeper.Johannes van Groenevelde, Fiscaal.Pieter Bout, Cashier and Secretary.With a view to enable His Excellency the Governor and the Council to
alter or amplify this Memoir in compliance with the orders from Their
Excellencies at Batavia, cited at the commencement of this document,
I have purposely written on half of the pages only, so that final
instructions might be added, as mine are only provisional.In case
Your Honours should require any of the documents cited which are
not kept here at the Secretariate, they may be applied for from His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.Wishing Your
Honours God's blessing, and all prosperity in the administration of
this extensive Commandement,


I remain, Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
H. ZWAARDECROON.Jaffnapatam, January 1, 1697.A.--The above Instructions were ready for Your Honours when, on
January 31 last, the yacht "Bekenstyn" brought a letter from Colombo
dated January 18, in which we were informed of the arrival of our new
Governor, His Excellency Gerrit de Heere.By the same vessel an extract
was sent from a letter of the Supreme Government of India of October
19 last, in which my transfer to Mallabaar has been ordered.But,
much as I had wished to serve the Company on that coast, I could
not at once obey the order owing to a serious illness accompanied
by a fit, with which it pleased the Lord to afflict me on January
18.Although not yet quite recovered, I have preferred to undertake
the voyage to Mallabaar without putting it off for another six months,
trusting that God will help me duly to serve my superiors, although
the latter course seemed more advisable on account of my state of
health.As some matters have occurred and some questions have arisen
since the writing of my Memoir, I have to add here a few explanations.B.--Together with the above-mentioned letter from Colombo, of January
18, we also received a document signed by both Their Excellencies
Governors Thomas van Rhee and Gerrit de Heere, by which all trade
in Ceylon except that of cinnamon is made open and free to every
one.Since no extract from the letter from Batavia with regard to this
matter was enclosed, I have been in doubt as to how far the permission
spoken of in that document was to be extended.As I am setting down
here my doubt on this point, His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo will, I have no doubt, give further information
upon it.I suppose that the trade in elephants is excepted as well
as that in cinnamon, and that it is still prohibited to capture,
transport, or sell these animals otherwise than on behalf of the
Company, either directly or indirectly, as has been the usage so far.C.--I suppose there will be no necessity now to obtain the areca-nuts
as ordered in the Instructions from Colombo of March 23, 1695, but
that these nuts are included among the articles open to free trade,
so that they may be now brought from Jaffnapatam through the Wanni to
Tondy, Madura, and Coromandel, as well as to other places in Ceylon,
provided the payment of the usual Customs duty of the Alphandigo,
[69] which is 7 1/2 per cent.for export, and that it may also be
freely transported through the Passes on the borders of the Wanni, and
that no Customs duty is to be paid except when it is sent by sea.I
understand that the same will be the rule for cotton, pepper, &c.,
brought from the Wanni to be sent by sea.This will greatly increase
the Alphandigo, so that the conditions for the farming of these must
be altered for the future accordingly.If the Customs duty were also
charged at the Passes, the farming out of these would still increase,
but I do not think that it would benefit the Company very much, because
there are many opportunities for smuggling beyond these three Passes,
and the expenditure of keeping guards would be far too great.The
duty being recovered as Alphandigo, there is no chance of smuggling,
as the vessels have to be provided with proper passports.All vessels
from Jaffnapatam are inspected at the Waterfort, Hammenhiel and at
the redoubt Point Pedro.D.--In my opinion the concession of free trade will necessitate the
remission of the duty on the Jaffnapatam native and foreign cloths,
because otherwise Jaffnapatam would be too heavily taxed compared
with other places, as the duty is 20 and 25 per cent.I think both
the cloths made here and those imported from outside ought to be
taxed through the Alphandigo of 7 1/2 per cent.This would still more
increase the duty, and this must be borne in mind when these revenues
are farmed out next December, if His Excellency the Governor and the
Council approve of my advice.is far too
high, and it must be remembered that this was a duty imposed with a
view to prevent the weaving of cloths and to secure the monopoly of
the trade to the Company, and not in order to make a revenue out of
it.This project did not prove a success; but I will not enter into
details about it, as these may be found in the questions submitted
by me to the Council of Ceylon on January 22, 1695, and I have also
mentioned them in this Memoir under the heading of Rents.E.--It seems to me that henceforth the people of Jaffnapatam would,
as a result of this free trade, be no longer bound to deliver to the
Company the usual 24 casks of coconut oil yearly before they are
allowed to export their nuts.This rule was laid down in a letter
from Colombo of October 13, 1696, with a view to prevent Ceylon being
obliged to obtain coconut oil from outside.This duty was imposed
upon Jaffnapatam, because the trees in Galle and Matura had become
unfruitful from the Company's elephants having to be fed with the
leaves.The same explanation was not urged with regard to Negombo,
which is so much nearer to Colombo than Galle, Matura, or Jaffnapatam,
and it is a well-known fact that many of the ships from Jaffnapatam
and other places are sent with coconuts from Negombo to Coromandel
or Tondel, while the nuts from the lands of the owners there are held
back.I expect therefore that the new Governor His Excellency Gerrit
de Heere and the Council of Colombo will give us further instructions
with regard to this matter.More details may be found in this Memoir
under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--A letter was received from Colombo, bearing date March 4 last,
in which was enclosed a form of a passport which appears to have been
introduced there after the opening of the free trade, with orders to
introduce the same here.This has been done already during my presence
here and must be continued.G.--In the letter of the 9th instant we received various and important
instructions which must be carried out.An answer to this letter was
sent by us on the 22nd of the same month.One of these instructions is
to the effect that a new road should be cut for the elephants which are
to be sent from Colombo.Another requires the compilation of various
lists, one of which is to be a list of all lands belonging to the
Company or given away on behalf of it, with a statement showing by
whom, to whom, when, and why they were granted.I do not think this
order refers to Jaffnapatam, because all fields were sold during the
time of Commandeur Vosch and others.Only a few small pieces of land
were discovered during the compilation of the new Land Thombo, which
some of the natives had been cultivating.A few wild palmyra trees
have been found in the Province of Patchelepalle, but these and the
lands have been entered in the new Thombo.We cannot therefore very
well furnish such a list of lands as regards Jaffnapatam, because
the Company does not possess any, but if desired a copy of the new
Land Thombo (which will consist of several reams of imperial paper)
could be sent.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is
not a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,
and it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is
being compiled.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the
Company through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so
much has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also
was the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A
difficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is
to be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from
Galconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount
of 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the
orders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to
be employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity
in the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated
that the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,
while on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that
the amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or
elephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not
wish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had
been arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without
my knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His
Excellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,
and follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said
cheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques
of two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my
departure.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these
people for want of time.The merchants of Golconda have also requested
that, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an
advance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request
has been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for
about nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000
paras of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,
belonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as
I am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be
purchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for
nely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,
however, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must
be consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of
Negapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted
wherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they
may be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make
provision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great
concern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also
of the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will
only add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price
has been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's
pontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had
been obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost
above 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from
Kayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring
had not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away
by the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in
the nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent
the native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain
both by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive
on account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate
this matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your
Honours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by
the Council.In future such matters must always be brought before
the Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own
authority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry
much weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30
or 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also
be made a practice in future that these people are held responsible
for their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,
as they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the
changing of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in
future I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except
directly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the
value of the Pagodas.He must send them to the cashier in packets of
100 at a time, which must be sealed.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by
me to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other
members of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the
Supreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19
last year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as
the chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,
it will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide
whether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the
administration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,


I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. ZWAARDECROON.On board the yacht "Bekenstyn," in the harbour of
Manaar, March 29, 1697.SHORT NOTES by Gerrit de Heere, Governor of the Island of Ceylon,
    on the chief points raised in these Instructions of Commandeur
    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman
    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the
    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of
    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders
    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the
    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies
    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must
be also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof
de Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of
Batavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the
Instructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to
Mr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications
of all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be
sufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and
this would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally
and in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of
the Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the
Governor.de Bitter and the other members of
Council to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the
Company into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to
some Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that
they should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2 alias (elephants).The
distribution of these tributes is as follows:--


                                                        Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,

                                                                 ======

The accumulated arrears from the years 1680 to 1694, of which they
were discharged, amounted to 333 1/2 elephants.From that time up to
the present day the arrears have again accumulated to 86 3/4 alias,
namely:--


                                                   Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane                        57 1/2

                                                      ======
                     Total                            86 3/4


The result proves that all the honour and favours shown to these people
do not induce them to pay up their tribute; but on the contrary,
as has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on
increasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of
requesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would
be superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,
however, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious
terms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within
a year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,
I dismissed them.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
who owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused
by the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that
I would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I
agreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different
lands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them
to me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up
to the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties
to make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the
Company again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute
of 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this
than to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all
seen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a
bad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave
like boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I
see no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged
to do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon
as possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo
Poevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with
the orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be
allowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding
that he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale
must be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,
contained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,
Carnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,
and the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small
and consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,
however, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in
doing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the
tithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it
were paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by
supplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger
quantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,
as if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter
under the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which
will result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to
the effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip
Nellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe
the Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be
watched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which
the brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time
does not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by
officers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the
Company received from there a large number of elephants, besides the
tithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.The
two Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that
they do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the
inhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published
by Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,
any statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule
of the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed
to capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little
document, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the
hunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the
year 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be
found, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really
had to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate
this matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the
hunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the
capture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with
the orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should
be obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and
Mantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,
was doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an
average no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,
until in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of
Ponneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the
Lord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces
were granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don
Gaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which
could be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of
Ponneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as
their services should be required by the Company and as they had been
accustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;
because, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although
in the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44
animals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.:--

During the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,
so that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,
131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and
did not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even
prevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;
and, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been
granted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the
Company, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised
over the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of
gift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of
their authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For
these reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary
for the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant
Albert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,
has gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which
was done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the
capture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of
the Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,
because the hunt has been greatly neglected.Your Honour may allow
both the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our
authorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as
the rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a
year.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to
Fl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated
in the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by
bidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this
was really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove
of the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been
carried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests
of the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute
the public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the
Company has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,
no more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least
prejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,
as all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may
be found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions
arrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily
resolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was
left with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed
methods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one
but Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged
and pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year
for the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all
be transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on
account of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a
little earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that
all the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the
20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,
ready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year
the Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants
for the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of
cash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200
animals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The
practice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of
public auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss
to the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the
Company also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals
do not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of
ready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it
must be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that
are to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all
preparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,
or, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile
all the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be
left behind on account of contrary winds.As we have now cut a road,
by which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,
as was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips
from Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here
with great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former
plan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and
Colombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and
proving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or
15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is
always required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be
fetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16
animals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,
but which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,
No 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may
be employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must
see that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don
Diogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted
among those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is
known to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the
animals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when
they were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and
consider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning
with No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have
been made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they
must begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross
must be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,
especially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best
way of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the
King's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's
territory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining
these nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these
people fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the
necessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason
why these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of
elephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase
as he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their
cash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which
should be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner
informed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,
but also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,
and this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all
appearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,
and Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make
up for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before
what number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a
quantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the
usual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they
did not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of
the required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by
the first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at
any price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way
that it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that
the taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the
inhabitants asked for this to be done.It will be the duty of the
Dessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,
which were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is
brought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with
the work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old
and infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the
list, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age
are entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,
and the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according
to the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays
his share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as
a whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by
the old method.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to
serve, must be looked after, as this is the only practicable means
of continuing the necessary works.The idea of raising the fine for
non-attendance from 2 stivers, which they willingly pay, to 4 stivers
or one fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise
already for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two
parties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked
by mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances
of the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be
well to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,
with a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent
in the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on
by every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended
to see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are
collected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,
because such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old
and infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must
still deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No
objections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken
in our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not
seem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of
the Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well
if these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions
of 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every
three years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when
an attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various
castes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered
advisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the
Company made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could
be brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when
they die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily
done.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that
the appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of
the actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or
until another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does
not mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor
of the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the
Commandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without
his knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused
by the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order
that Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better
for you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,
nor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and
all other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate
to us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice
in debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The
Dessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take
care that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as
Lascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be
excused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers
and is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in
Colombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to
be supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of
another famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out
very well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although
it is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must
be remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who
have but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of
the Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they
are not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present
at the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because
it is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company
by every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why
the concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor
of India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been
executed, and we consider that on account of the long interval that
has elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer
the Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,
will be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most
profitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number
than 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they
paid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a
larger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity
of food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many
slaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias
could make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so
that there is some reason for the question whether the Company does
not run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this
Commandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered
from chicken-pox since the importation of slaves, which may endanger
whole Provinces, I think it will be well to prevent the importation of
slaves.As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the
opposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of
rice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The
danger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as
the rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the
extreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they
would kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore
I think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,
not only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's
territory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly
guard against a monopoly being made of this grain.This opportunity
is taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this
Commandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the
native trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by
Mr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,
that all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point
Pedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,
in order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This
matter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties
are raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the
delivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering
the large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that
this could be easily done; because, according to what is published from
time to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that
during the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of
5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled
and the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that
one cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from
5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670
nuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole
supply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do
not understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,
and why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for
good payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts
it will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the
kinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express
my opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,
I found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the
oil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per
marcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,
10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They
also delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council
were bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it
was absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,
the excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own
requirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not
discuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful
and energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary
correspondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave
is present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel
tools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended
here must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and
Palecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the
Supreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should
be purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large
demand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking
that the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of
than that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no
more than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was
by no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable
wood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons
at Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore
specially request that during the next northern monsoon the following
are sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary
building operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in
two kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,
three out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that
this timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the
supervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to
any inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such
a person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,
and the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under
the heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound
to deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as
a substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were
sent last January as promised to Your Honour.This must, however,
be economically used.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience
than of importance.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting
this duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the
other hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well
if it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers
would not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,
as that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of
cost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000
paras from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in
payment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that
any amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed
by Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.But as
another order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel
for 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way
that I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would
add some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my
doing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of
foreign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,
must be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth
(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20
per cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term
at the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated
in the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are
prospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in
future, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been
given here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further
comments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders
at the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon
reduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed
to the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders
from the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution
of 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;
because, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to
14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--


                                                     Guilders.[74]
    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8
    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0
    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0

    Ambelewanner                                     150.0.0
                                                  ===========
                                      Total       14,118.11.8


Herein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to
the weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for
the delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them
later on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue
to be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I
have seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the
Company will make any profit on it; especially if the people should
get into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash
issued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from
Batavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,
that Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of
by Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,
but I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,
and inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,
Your Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not
act prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13
guilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,
and no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be
employed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they
need be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their
being discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the
natives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which
would be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so
many other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his
large number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also
openly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid
the vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of
Christianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference
whether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of
Jaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,
for whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously
enlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their
instruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6
guilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the
instructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11
elephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced
to him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from
the Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but
that the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,
but with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of
the Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the
Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already
employed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is
best to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard
to the passports must be followed pending further orders.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the
Court of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins
of Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient
knowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse
the documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,
but in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time
(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation
of the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the
surveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,
but every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In
case of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas
Isaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties
there, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the
Political Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time
of the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work
at the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in
Colombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice
by the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have
been made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must
be observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think
that the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient
for the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but
will refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the
Seminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this
large school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays
for the services and every day to call the children to school and
to meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to
see that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some
steps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be
considered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only
confirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the
improvement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I
have heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the
decay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur
to prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the
Memoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly
worthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been
held or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these
sittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur
in Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for
Mallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my
arrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also
that the election of the double number of members for this College had
twice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo
without a single meeting being held.It seems to me incomprehensible,
and as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every
week without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the
Commandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this
order is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a
meeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,
namely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur
Biermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has
been built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will
quite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as
proposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial
meetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,
as is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been
built already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up
a special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the
errors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place
should be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being
erected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes
or passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the
Castle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole
row of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect
new buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special
orders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly
observed.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I
cannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard
to the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage
Causes, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of
Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over
the last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage
and the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,
10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large
building and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been
chiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for
now, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to
Fl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of
finding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied
from the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf
of the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be
observed.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,
1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this
country.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems
to be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other
rogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that
none but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24
fannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in
payment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or
anywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment
laid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule
is observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the
Company's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the
annexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions
are given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be
still observed.Further information or instructions may be obtained
from Colombo.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the
fortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead
of raising any points or curtains.But improvements may be made,
such as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the
outside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,
as I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever
the canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some
places even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points
of the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be
very dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would
not stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the
artillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards
could be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the
stones being crushed by the wheels.I noticed further that each canon
stands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of
the curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are
fired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great
difficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It
would be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled
up.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;
this was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with
muskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This
deficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about
half a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could
be easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at
present whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur
or that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered
the removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which
can be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the
soldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,
and I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,
which was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,
and the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and
they must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of
the canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different
platforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which
can be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small
and the materials are at hand.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well
as those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as
yet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope
of its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that
experiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the
work has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the
Commissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work
continued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he
had to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.The
chief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the
coral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to
be blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but
lower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to
take fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should
be obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season
when the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are
not engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number
of labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not
undertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but
as the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,
it may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or
4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of
completing the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the
water, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,
&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It
would be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both
the outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work
would be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,
this is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I
admit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,
but the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great
deal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would
be just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite
the fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great
necessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and
stone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and
the carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed
by a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest
in that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it
would have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I
do not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that
corner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,
moreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could
be broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could
come near without being observed.As these buildings have been only
newly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the
orders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to
oppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I
found the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide
as it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places
also it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it
four or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not
think the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony
soil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing
even that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be
to direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make
them useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat
be deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a
level with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always
stand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during
the dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This
proposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,
in fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long
as the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity
for a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will
dispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,
which I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection
of the harbour and the river of Kaits.The sand bank and the wall
damaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir
is undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part
of the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and
it would be well if the project of Mr.This is a
very necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances
permit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because
the old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the
water tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch
bricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because
there are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the
full garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44
men, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the
advanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this
fortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt
was not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It
has been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam
on the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of
the moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be
removed.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,
and my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The
pavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of
the galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir
of brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be
surrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view
to prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise
likely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,
as it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend
returning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and
ammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a
wise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of
experience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially
with regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to
which we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as
far as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that
no extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on
the other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by
being kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except
that from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present
rice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it
necessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver
their rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat
and ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,
to be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to
be feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to
the account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the
Company all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in
future to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in
emergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to
capture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,
while dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack
must never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia
it is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be
done here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In
future bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who
accepted it.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,
to say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these
orders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a
sufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair
the old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to
Colombo.The storing away of fuel is a
praiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little
kept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as
in other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,
in order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who
came here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left
at Manaar and appointed to that station.I therefore do not think it
necessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to
reduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that
if they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might
be sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We
are on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ
any new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict
discipline and continual military drill are very important points,
specially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans
are employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily
expenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be
observed.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found
to be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,
and may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified
officers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.Meantime
I authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is
indispensable.I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,
and also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,
and that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed
for this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into
readiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable
in the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,
but the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is
always wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground
and coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is
also necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance
of the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are
very strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also
think that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half
stone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present
for such people.These and other improvements are also recommended
to the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for
higher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this
on my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest
pay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have
to do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test
would do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the
number here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in
all places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who
receive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be
raised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no
increase will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the
intermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated
in Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always
to the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the
case of women without children the matter is not quite so important,
and I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a
native proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing
to place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no
more slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with
free people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,
but those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some
trade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It
is not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might
have undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case
very soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should
be paid to all that passes at Manaar.This has been confirmed again
by our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty
from the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done
by the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time
of the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be
awaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,
and in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether
it would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think
that this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously
recommend better supervision.It is unaccountable how so many of
these animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals
sent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,
only one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is
it to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large
number of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not
be looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants
kept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,
while two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than
120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,
although there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby
elephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as
has been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,
which would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,
but even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,
moreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then
a large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,
for I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others
who have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses
and in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must
be carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)
were absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the
way.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only
one cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They
are only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or
15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,
and it is very likely that those that are being transported get still
less, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How
little regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands
of Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,
when questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or
those who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and
inexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned
or even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's
interests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,
and fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the
death of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss
to the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were
held mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of
Mantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in
the stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have
more than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During
the dry season the animals must be distributed over the different
villages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be
taken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias
[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at
present, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should
be appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,
to supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,
and see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly
fed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by
buffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,
and in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise
the transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,
and he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies
for.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his
charge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to
the boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,
and he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them
to the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the
animals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see
that these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements
he could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is
all I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,
are mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the
sale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of
the Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard
to the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked
for pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be
made.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next
fishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard
to the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as
beacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with
the necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the
question as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account
of the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see
that it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure
that a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question
once more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may
be discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held
in the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His
blessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last
time, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account
of the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the
inhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks
about them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the
annexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw
about 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught
with nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly
good race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500
foals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be
large enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three
teams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four
horses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors
and courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible
alike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many
of which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost
useless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service
of the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle
horse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,
25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public
auction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,
as they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at
which the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,
but always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the
interest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further
recommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the
islands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,
where the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little
tamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this
stable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to
whom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is
moreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is
very unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island
Delft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now
found there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing
rapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of
two, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition
to the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed
to increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have
to derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,
but they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated
and must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of
water; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and
it would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and
Beschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;
Aripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks
are necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that
I would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit
the redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in
what way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the
different proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve
preference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,
as it would have to be two miles long.As to the other proposals,
such as that of making a fence of palmyra trees or thorns, or to
dig a moat, I think it would be labour in vain; but whatever is
done must be carried out without expense or trouble to the Company,
in compliance with the orders from the Supreme Government of India.The instructions with regard to the water tanks must be carried
out as far as possible.I agree with what is said here with regard to the public roads.That the elephant stalls and the churches should have been allowed
to fall into decay speaks badly for the way in which those concerned
have performed their duty; and it is a cause of dissatisfaction.The
orders for the stalls in Manaar must also be applied for here,
and repairs carried out as soon as possible.I have been informed
that there are many elephants scattered here and there far from each
other, while only one Vidana acts as chief overseer, so that he cannot
possibly attend to his duty properly.It has been observed that the
elephants should have more parias or men who provide their food.These
and other orders with regard to the animals should be carried out.No remarks are required with regard to this subject of thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Carret, and elephants' tusks.The General Paresse [80] has been held upon my orders on the last
of July.Three requests were made, two of which were so frivolous and
unimportant that I need not mention them here.The
third and more important one was that the duty on native cloth,
which at present is 25 per cent., might be reduced.It was agreed
that from the 31st December it would be only 20 per cent.I was in a
position to settle this matter at once, because orders had been already
received from Batavia that they could be reduced to 20 per cent.,
but no more.As shown in the annexed Memoir, the inhabitants are not
so badly off as they try to make us believe.The further instructions
in the annexed Memoir must be observed; and although I have verbally
ordered the Onderkoopman De Bitter to have the Pattangatyns appear
only twice instead of twelve times a year, as being an unbearable
inconvenience, the Dessave must see that this order is obeyed.He must
also make inquiries whether the work could be done by one Cannekappul,
and, if so, Jeronimus must be discharged.Conclusion.--The advice in this conclusion may be useful to Your
Honours.I confirm the list of members of the Political Council,
to whom the rule of this Commandement in the interest of the Company
is seriously recommended.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

1697.I shudder at this too corporeal auditor,
and turn towards another point of the compass where the haze is
unbroken.Why should I not indulge this remaining illusion, since I do
not take my approving choral paradise as a warrant for setting the press
to work again and making some thousand sheets of superior paper
unsaleable?I leave my manuscripts to a judgment outside my imagination,
but I will not ask to hear it, or request my friend to pronounce, before
I have been buried decently, what he really thinks of my parts, and to
state candidly whether my papers would be most usefully applied in
lighting the cheerful domestic fire.It is too probable that he will be
exasperated at the trouble I have given him of reading them; but the
consequent clearness and vivacity with which he could demonstrate to me
that the fault of my manuscripts, as of my one published work, is simply
flatness, and not that surpassing subtilty which is the preferable
ground of popular neglect--this verdict, however instructively
expressed, is a portion of earthly discipline of which I will not
beseech my friend to be the instrument.Other persons, I am aware, have
not the same cowardly shrinking from a candid opinion of their
performances, and are even importunately eager for it; but I have
convinced myself in numerous cases that such exposers of their own back
to the smiter were of too hopeful a disposition to believe in the
scourge, and really trusted in a pleasant anointing, an outpouring of
balm without any previous wounds.I am of a less trusting disposition,
and will only ask my friend to use his judgment in insuring me against
posthumous mistake.Thus I make myself a charter to write, and keep the pleasing, inspiring
illusion of being listened to, though I may sometimes write about
myself.What I have already said on this too familiar theme has been
meant only as a preface, to show that in noting the weaknesses of my
acquaintances I am conscious of my fellowship with them.That a
gratified sense of superiority is at the root of barbarous laughter may
be at least half the truth.But there is a loving laughter in which the
only recognised superiority is that of the ideal self, the God within,
holding the mirror and the scourge for our own pettiness as well as our
neighbours'.Most of us who have had decent parents would shrink from wishing that
our father and mother had been somebody else whom we never knew; yet it
is held no impiety, rather, a graceful mark of instruction, for a man to
wail that he was not the son of another age and another nation, of which
also he knows nothing except through the easy process of an imperfect
imagination and a flattering fancy.But the period thus looked back on with a purely admiring regret, as
perfect enough to suit a superior mind, is always a long way off; the
desirable contemporaries are hardly nearer than Leonardo da Vinci, most
likely they are the fellow-citizens of Pericles, or, best of all, of the
Aeolic lyrists whose sparse remains suggest a comfortable contrast with
our redundance.No impassioned personage wishes he had been born in the
age of Pitt, that his ardent youth might have eaten the dearest bread,
dressed itself with the longest coat-tails and the shortest waist, or
heard the loudest grumbling at the heaviest war-taxes; and it would be
really something original in polished verse if one of our young writers
declared he would gladly be turned eighty-five that he might have known
the joy and pride of being an Englishman when there were fewer reforms
and plenty of highwaymen, fewer discoveries and more faces pitted with
the small-pox, when laws were made to keep up the price of corn, and the
troublesome Irish were more miserable.Three-quarters of a century ago
is not a distance that lends much enchantment to the view.We are
familiar with the average men of that period, and are still consciously
encumbered with its bad contrivances and mistaken acts.The lords and
gentlemen painted by young Lawrence talked and wrote their nonsense in a
tongue we thoroughly understand; hence their times are not much
flattered, not much glorified by the yearnings of that modern sect of
Flagellants who make a ritual of lashing--not themselves but--all their
neighbours.To me, however, that paternal time, the time of my father's
youth, never seemed prosaic, for it came to my imagination first through
his memories, which made a wondrous perspective to my little daily world
of discovery.And for my part I can call no age absolutely unpoetic: how
should it be so, since there are always children to whom the acorns and
the swallow's eggs are a wonder, always those human passions and
fatalities through which Garrick as Hamlet in bob-wig and knee-breeches
moved his audience more than some have since done in velvet tunic and
plume?But every age since the golden may be made more or less prosaic
by minds that attend only to its vulgar and sordid elements, of which
there was always an abundance even in Greece and Italy, the favourite
realms of the retrospective optimists.To be quite fair towards the
ages, a little ugliness as well as beauty must be allowed to each of
them, a little implicit poetry even to those which echoed loudest with
servile, pompous, and trivial prose.Such impartiality is not in vogue at present.If we acknowledge our
obligation to the ancients, it is hardly to be done without some
flouting of our contemporaries, who with all their faults must be
allowed the merit of keeping the world habitable for the refined
eulogists of the blameless past.One wonders whether the remarkable
originators who first had the notion of digging wells, or of churning
for butter, and who were certainly very useful to their own time as well
as ours, were left quite free from invidious comparison with
predecessors who let the water and the milk alone, or whether some
rhetorical nomad, as he stretched himself on the grass with a good
appetite for contemporary butter, became loud on the virtue of ancestors
who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow; nay, whether in a high
flight of imaginative self-sacrifice (after swallowing the butter) he
even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of
a generation more _naive_ than his own.I have often had the fool's hectic of wishing about the unalterable, but
with me that useless exercise has turned chiefly on the conception of a
different self, and not, as it usually does in literature, on the
advantage of having been born in a different age, and more especially in
one where life is imagined to have been altogether majestic and
graceful.With my present abilities, external proportions, and generally
small provision for ecstatic enjoyment, where is the ground for
confidence that I should have had a preferable career in such an epoch
of society?An age in which every department has its awkward-squad seems
in my mind's eye to suit me better.I might have wandered by the Strymon
under Philip and Alexander without throwing any new light on method or
organising the sum of human knowledge; on the other hand, I might have
objected to Aristotle as too much of a systematiser, and have preferred
the freedom of a little self-contradiction as offering more chances of
truth.I gather, too, from the undeniable testimony of his disciple
Theophrastus that there were bores, ill-bred persons, and detractors
even in Athens, of species remarkably corresponding to the English, and
not yet made endurable by being classic; and altogether, with my present
fastidious nostril, I feel that I am the better off for possessing
Athenian life solely as an inodorous fragment of antiquity.As to
Sappho's Mitylene, while I am convinced that the Lesbian capital held
some plain men of middle stature and slow conversational powers, the
addition of myself to their number, though clad in the majestic folds of
the himation and without cravat, would hardly have made a sensation
among the accomplished fair ones who were so precise in adjusting their
own drapery about their delicate ankles.Whereas by being another sort
of person in the present age I might have given it some needful
theoretic clue; or I might have poured forth poetic strains which would
have anticipated theory and seemed a voice from "the prophetic soul of
the wide world dreaming of things to come;" or I might have been one of
those benignant lovely souls who, without astonishing the public and
posterity, make a happy difference in the lives close around them, and
in this way lift the average of earthly joy: in some form or other I
might have been so filled from the store of universal existence that I
should have been freed from that empty wishing which is like a child's
cry to be inside a golden cloud, its imagination being too ignorant to
figure the lining of dimness and damp.On the whole, though there is some rash boasting about enlightenment,
and an occasional insistance on an originality which is that of the
present year's corn-crop, we seem too much disposed to indulge, and to
call by complimentary names, a greater charity for other portions of the
human race than for our contemporaries.All reverence and gratitude for
the worthy Dead on whose labours we have entered, all care for the
future generations whose lot we are preparing; but some affection and
fairness for those who are doing the actual work of the world, some
attempt to regard them with the same freedom from ill-temper, whether on
private or public grounds, as we may hope will be felt by those who will
call us ancient!Otherwise, the looking before and after, which is our
grand human privilege, is in danger of turning to a sort of
other-worldliness, breeding a more illogical indifference or bitterness
than was ever bred by the ascetic's contemplation of heaven.Except on
the ground of a primitive golden age and continuous degeneracy, I see no
rational footing for scorning the whole present population of the globe,
unless I scorn every previous generation from whom they have inherited
their diseases of mind and body, and by consequence scorn my own scorn,
which is equally an inheritance of mixed ideas and feelings concocted
for me in the boiling caldron of this universally contemptible life, and
so on--scorning to infinity.This may represent some actual states of
mind, for it is a narrow prejudice of mathematicians to suppose that
ways of thinking are to be driven out of the field by being reduced to
an absurdity.The Absurd is taken as an excellent juicy thistle by many
constitutions.Reflections of this sort have gradually determined me not to grumble at
the age in which I happen to have been born--a natural tendency
certainly older than Hesiod.Many ancient beautiful things are lost,
many ugly modern things have arisen; but invert the proposition and it
is equally true.I at least am a modern with some interest in advocating
tolerance, and notwithstanding an inborn beguilement which carries my
affection and regret continually into an imagined past, I am aware that
I must lose all sense of moral proportion unless I keep alive a stronger
attachment to what is near, and a power of admiring what I best know and
understand.Hence this question of wishing to be rid of one's
contemporaries associates itself with my filial feeling, and calls up
the thought that I might as justifiably wish that I had had other
parents than those whose loving tones are my earliest memory, and whose
last parting first taught me the meaning of death.I feel bound to quell
such a wish as blasphemy.Besides, there are other reasons why I am contented that my father was a
country parson, born much about the same time as Scott and Wordsworth;
notwithstanding certain qualms I have felt at the fact that the property
on which I am living was saved out of tithe before the period of
commutation, and without the provisional transfiguration into a modus.It has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of
excellent ham that, from a too tenable point of view, I was breakfasting
on a small squealing black pig which, more than half a century ago, was
the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise
acknowledged by the grudging farmer or dairyman who parted with him.One
enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward, and
such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham; but
since I have nevertheless eaten it, the chief effect has been to
moderate the severity of my radicalism (which was not part of my
paternal inheritance) and to raise the assuaging reflection, that if the
pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my
historical point of view, they would have seen themselves and the rector
in a light that would have made tithe voluntary.Notwithstanding such
drawbacks I am rather fond of the mental furniture I got by having a
father who was well acquainted with all ranks of his neighbours, and am
thankful that he was not one of those aristocratic clergymen who could
not have sat down to a meal with any family in the parish except my
lord's--still more that he was not an earl or a marquis.A chief
misfortune of high birth is that it usually shuts a man out from the
large sympathetic knowledge of human experience which comes from contact
with various classes on their own level, and in my father's time that
entail of social ignorance had not been disturbed as we see it now.To
look always from overhead at the crowd of one's fellow-men must be in
many ways incapacitating, even with the best will and intelligence.The
serious blunders it must lead to in the effort to manage them for their
good, one may see clearly by the mistaken ways people take of flattering
and enticing those whose associations are unlike their own.Hence I have
always thought that the most fortunate Britons are those whose
experience has given them a practical share in many aspects of the
national lot, who have lived long among the mixed commonalty, roughing
it with them under difficulties, knowing how their food tastes to them,
and getting acquainted with their notions and motives not by inference
from traditional types in literature or from philosophical theories, but
from daily fellowship and observation.Of course such experience is apt
to get antiquated, and my father might find himself much at a loss
amongst a mixed rural population of the present day; but he knew very
well what could be wisely expected from the miners, the weavers, the
field-labourers, and farmers of his own time--yes, and from the
aristocracy, for he had been brought up in close contact with them and
had been companion to a young nobleman who was deaf and dumb."A
clergyman, lad," he used to say to me, "should feel in himself a bit of
every class;" and this theory had a felicitous agreement with his
inclination and practice, which certainly answered in making him beloved
by his parishioners.They grumbled at their obligations towards him; but
what then?It was natural to grumble at any demand for payment, tithe
included, but also natural for a rector to desire his tithe and look
well after the levying.A Christian pastor who did not mind about his
money was not an ideal prevalent among the rural minds of fat central
England, and might have seemed to introduce a dangerous laxity of
supposition about Christian laymen who happened to be creditors.My
father was none the less beloved because he was understood to be of a
saving disposition, and how could he save without getting his tithe?The
sight of him was not unwelcome at any door, and he was remarkable among
the clergy of his district for having no lasting feud with rich or poor
in his parish.I profited by his popularity, and for months after my
mother's death, when I was a little fellow of nine, I was taken care of
first at one homestead and then at another; a variety which I enjoyed
much more than my stay at the Hall, where there was a tutor.Afterwards
for several years I was my father's constant companion in his outdoor
business, riding by his side on my little pony and listening to the
lengthy dialogues he held with Darby or Joan, the one on the road or in
the fields, the other outside or inside her door.In my earliest
remembrance of him his hair was already grey, for I was his youngest as
well as his only surviving child; and it seemed to me that advanced age
was appropriate to a father, as indeed in all respects I considered him
a parent so much to my honour, that the mention of my relationship to
him was likely to secure me regard among those to whom I was otherwise a
stranger--my father's stories from his life including so many names of
distant persons that my imagination placed no limit to his
acquaintanceship.He was a pithy talker, and his sermons bore marks of
his own composition.It is true, they must have been already old when I
began to listen to them, and they were no more than a year's supply, so
that they recurred as regularly as the Collects.But though this system
has been much ridiculed, I am prepared to defend it as equally sound
with that of a liturgy; and even if my researches had shown me that some
of my father's yearly sermons had been copied out from the works of
elder divines, this would only have been another proof of his good
judgment.One may prefer fresh eggs though laid by a fowl of the meanest
understanding, but why fresh sermons?Nor can I be sorry, though myself given to meditative if not active
innovation, that my father was a Tory who had not exactly a dislike to
innovators and dissenters, but a slight opinion of them as persons of
ill-founded self-confidence; whence my young ears gathered many details
concerning those who might perhaps have called themselves the more
advanced thinkers in our nearest market-town, tending to convince me
that their characters were quite as mixed as those of the thinkers
behind them.This circumstance of my rearing has at least delivered me
from certain mistakes of classification which I observe in many of my
superiors, who have apparently no affectionate memories of a goodness
mingled with what they now regard as outworn prejudices.Indeed, my
philosophical notions, such as they are, continually carry me back to
the time when the fitful gleams of a spring day used to show me my own
shadow as that of a small boy on a small pony, riding by the side of a
larger cob-mounted shadow over the breezy uplands which we used to
dignify with the name of hills, or along by-roads with broad grassy
borders and hedgerows reckless of utility, on our way to outlying
hamlets, whose groups of inhabitants were as distinctive to my
imagination as if they had belonged to different regions of the globe.From these we sometimes rode onward to the adjoining parish, where also
my father officiated, for he was a pluralist, but--I hasten to add--on
the smallest scale; for his one extra living was a poor vicarage, with
hardly fifty parishioners, and its church would have made a very shabby
barn, the grey worm-eaten wood of its pews and pulpit, with their doors
only half hanging on the hinges, being exactly the colour of a lean
mouse which I once observed as an interesting member of the scant
congregation, and conjectured to be the identical church mouse I had
heard referred to as an example of extreme poverty; for I was a
precocious boy, and often reasoned after the fashion of my elders,
arguing that "Jack and Jill" were real personages in our parish, and
that if I could identify "Jack" I should find on him the marks of a
broken crown.Sometimes when I am in a crowded London drawing-room (for I am a
town-bird now, acquainted with smoky eaves, and tasting Nature in the
parks) quick flights of memory take me back among my father's
parishioners while I am still conscious of elbowing men who wear the
same evening uniform as myself; and I presently begin to wonder what
varieties of history lie hidden under this monotony of aspect.Some of
them, perhaps, belong to families with many quarterings; but how many
"quarterings" of diverse contact with their fellow-countrymen enter into
their qualifications to be parliamentary leaders, professors of social
science, or journalistic guides of the popular mind?Not that I feel
myself a person made competent by experience; on the contrary, I argue
that since an observation of different ranks has still left me
practically a poor creature, what must be the condition of those who
object even to read about the life of other British classes than their
own?But of my elbowing neighbours with their crush hats, I usually
imagine that the most distinguished among them have probably had a far
more instructive journey into manhood than mine.Here, perhaps, is a
thought-worn physiognomy, seeming at the present moment to be classed as
a mere species of white cravat and swallow-tail, which may once, like
Faraday's, have shown itself in curiously dubious embryonic form leaning
against a cottage lintel in small corduroys, and hungrily eating a bit
of brown bread and bacon; _there_ is a pair of eyes, now too much
wearied by the gas-light of public assemblies, that once perhaps learned
to read their native England through the same alphabet as mine--not
within the boundaries of an ancestral park, never even being driven
through the county town five miles off, but--among the midland villages
and markets, along by the tree-studded hedgerows, and where the heavy
barges seem in the distance to float mysteriously among the rushes and
the feathered grass.Our vision, both real and ideal, has since then
been filled with far other scenes: among eternal snows and stupendous
sun-scorched monuments of departed empires; within the scent of the long
orange-groves; and where the temple of Neptune looks out over the
siren-haunted sea.But my eyes at least have kept their early
affectionate joy in our native landscape, which is one deep root of our
national life and language.And I often smile at my consciousness that certain conservative
prepossessions have mingled themselves for me with the influences of our
midland scenery, from the tops of the elms down to the buttercups and
the little wayside vetches.That part of my father's
prime to which he oftenest referred had fallen on the days when the
great wave of political enthusiasm and belief in a speedy regeneration
of all things had ebbed, and the supposed millennial initiative of
France was turning into a Napoleonic empire, the sway of an Attila with
a mouth speaking proud things in a jargon half revolutionary, half
Roman.Men were beginning to shrink timidly from the memory of their
own words and from the recognition of the fellowships they had formed
ten years before; and even reforming Englishmen for the most part were
willing to wait for the perfection of society, if only they could keep
their throats perfect and help to drive away the chief enemy of mankind
from our coasts.To my father's mind the noisy teachers of revolutionary
doctrine were, to speak mildly, a variable mixture of the fool and the
scoundrel; the welfare of the nation lay in a strong Government which
could maintain order; and I was accustomed to hear him utter the word
"Government" in a tone that charged it with awe, and made it part of my
effective religion, in contrast with the word "rebel," which seemed to
carry the stamp of evil in its syllables, and, lit by the fact that
Satan was the first rebel, made an argument dispensing with more
detailed inquiry.I gathered that our national troubles in the first two
decades of this century were not at all due to the mistakes of our
administrators; and that England, with its fine Church and Constitution,
would have been exceedingly well off if every British subject had been
thankful for what was provided, and had minded his own business--if,
for example, numerous Catholics of that period had been aware how very
modest they ought to be considering they were Irish.The times, I heard,
had often been bad; but I was constantly hearing of "bad times" as a
name for actual evenings and mornings when the godfathers who gave them
that name appeared to me remarkably comfortable.Altogether, my father's
England seemed to me lovable, laudable, full of good men, and having
good rulers, from Mr Pitt on to the Duke of Wellington, until he was for
emancipating the Catholics; and it was so far from prosaic to me that I
looked into it for a more exciting romance than such as I could find in
my own adventures, which consisted mainly in fancied crises calling for
the resolute wielding of domestic swords and firearms against unapparent
robbers, rioters, and invaders who, it seemed, in my father's prime had
more chance of being real.The morris-dancers had not then dwindled to a
ragged and almost vanished rout (owing the traditional name probably to
the historic fancy of our superannuated groom); also, the good old king
was alive and well, which made all the more difference because I had no
notion what he was and did--only understanding in general that if he had
been still on the throne he would have hindered everything that wise
persons thought undesirable.Certainly that elder England with its frankly saleable boroughs, so
cheap compared with the seats obtained under the reformed method, and
its boroughs kindly presented by noblemen desirous to encourage
gratitude; its prisons with a miscellaneous company of felons and
maniacs and without any supply of water; its bloated, idle charities;
its non-resident, jovial clergy; its militia-balloting; and above all,
its blank ignorance of what we, its posterity, should be thinking of
it,--has great differences from the England of to-day.Is there any country which shows at once as much
stability and as much susceptibility to change as ours?Our national
life is like that scenery which I early learned to love, not subject to
great convulsions, but easily showing more or less delicate (sometimes
melancholy) effects from minor changes.Hence our midland plains have
never lost their familiar expression and conservative spirit for me;
yet at every other mile, since I first looked on them, some sign of
world-wide change, some new direction of human labour has wrought itself
into what one may call the speech of the landscape--in contrast with
those grander and vaster regions of the earth which keep an indifferent
aspect in the presence of men's toil and devices.What does it signify
that a lilliputian train passes over a viaduct amidst the abysses of the
Apennines, or that a caravan laden with a nation's offerings creeps
across the unresting sameness of the desert, or that a petty cloud of
steam sweeps for an instant over the face of an Egyptian colossus
immovably submitting to its slow burial beneath the sand?But our
woodlands and pastures, our hedge-parted corn-fields and meadows, our
bits of high common where we used to plant the windmills, our quiet
little rivers here and there fit to turn a mill-wheel, our villages
along the old coach-roads, are all easily alterable lineaments that seem
to make the face of our Motherland sympathetic with the laborious lives
of her children.She does not take their ploughs and waggons
contemptuously, but rather makes every hovel and every sheepfold, every
railed bridge or fallen tree-trunk an agreeably noticeable incident; not
a mere speck in the midst of unmeasured vastness, but a piece of our
social history in pictorial writing.Our rural tracts--where no Babel-chimney scales the heavens--are without
mighty objects to fill the soul with the sense of an outer world
unconquerably aloof from our efforts.The wastes are playgrounds (and
let us try to keep them such for the children's children who will
inherit no other sort of demesne); the grasses and reeds nod to each
other over the river, but we have cut a canal close by; the very heights
laugh with corn in August or lift the plough-team against the sky in
September.Then comes a crowd of burly navvies with pickaxes and
barrows, and while hardly a wrinkle is made in the fading mother's face
or a new curve of health in the blooming girl's, the hills are cut
through or the breaches between them spanned, we choose our level and
the white steam-pennon flies along it.But because our land shows this readiness to be changed, all signs of
permanence upon it raise a tender attachment instead of awe: some of us,
at least, love the scanty relics of our forests, and are thankful if a
bush is left of the old hedgerow.A crumbling bit of wall where the
delicate ivy-leaved toad-flax hangs its light branches, or a bit of grey
thatch with patches of dark moss on its shoulder and a troop of
grass-stems on its ridge, is a thing to visit.And then the tiled roof
of cottage and homestead, of the long cow-shed where generations of the
milky mothers have stood patiently, of the broad-shouldered barns where
the old-fashioned flail once made resonant music, while the watch-dog
barked at the timidly venturesome fowls making pecking raids on the
outflying grain--the roofs that have looked out from among the elms and
walnut-trees, or beside the yearly group of hay and corn stacks, or
below the square stone steeple, gathering their grey or ochre-tinted
lichens and their olive-green mosses under all ministries,--let us
praise the sober harmonies they give to our landscape, helping to unite
us pleasantly with the elder generations who tilled the soil for us
before we were born, and paid heavier and heavier taxes, with much
grumbling, but without that deepest root of corruption--the
self-indulgent despair which cuts down and consumes and never plants.Perhaps this England of my affections is half
visionary--a dream in which things are connected according to my
well-fed, lazy mood, and not at all by the multitudinous links of
graver, sadder fact, such as belong everywhere to the story of human
labour.Well, well, the illusions that began for us when we were less
acquainted with evil have not lost their value when we discern them to
be illusions.They feed the ideal Better, and in loving them still, we
strengthen the precious habit of loving something not visibly, tangibly
existent, but a spiritual product of our visible tangible selves.I cherish my childish loves--the memory of that warm little nest where
my affections were fledged.Since then I have learned to care for
foreign countries, for literatures foreign and ancient, for the life of
Continental towns dozing round old cathedrals, for the life of London,
half sleepless with eager thought and strife, with indigestion or with
hunger; and now my consciousness is chiefly of the busy, anxious
metropolitan sort.My system responds sensitively to the London
weather-signs, political, social, literary; and my bachelor's hearth is
imbedded where by much craning of head and neck I can catch sight of a
sycamore in the Square garden: I belong to the "Nation of London."There have been many voluntary exiles in the world, and probably in the
very first exodus of the patriarchal Aryans--for I am determined not to
fetch my examples from races whose talk is of uncles and no
fathers--some of those who sallied forth went for the sake of a loved
companionship, when they would willingly have kept sight of the familiar
plains, and of the hills to which they had first lifted up their eyes.HOW WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCH.The serene and beneficent goddess Truth, like other deities whose
disposition has been too hastily inferred from that of the men who have
invoked them, can hardly be well pleased with much of the worship paid
to her even in this milder age, when the stake and the rack have ceased
to form part of her ritual.Some cruelties still pass for service done
in her honour: no thumb-screw is used, no iron boot, no scorching of
flesh; but plenty of controversial bruising, laceration, and even
lifelong maiming.Less than formerly; but so long as this sort of
truth-worship has the sanction of a public that can often understand
nothing in a controversy except personal sarcasm or slanderous ridicule,
it is likely to continue.The sufferings of its victims are often as
little regarded as those of the sacrificial pig offered in old time,
with what we now regard as a sad miscalculation of effects.One such victim is my old acquaintance Merman.Twenty years ago Merman was a young man of promise, a conveyancer with a
practice which had certainly budded, but, like Aaron's rod, seemed not
destined to proceed further in that marvellous activity.Meanwhile he
occupied himself in miscellaneous periodical writing and in a
multifarious study of moral and physical science.What chiefly attracted
him in all subjects were the vexed questions which have the advantage of
not admitting the decisive proof or disproof that renders many ingenious
arguments superannuated.Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition: he
put all his doubts, queries, and paradoxes deferentially, contended
without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the
personality of Homer, expressed himself civilly though firmly on the
origin of language, and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such
subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the so-called elementary
substances, his own total scepticism concerning Manetho's chronology, or
even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the
outbreak of revolutionary tendencies.Such flexibility was naturally
much helped by his amiable feeling towards woman, whose nervous system,
he was convinced, would not bear the continuous strain of difficult
topics; and also by his willingness to contribute a song whenever the
same desultory charmer proposed music.Indeed his tastes were domestic
enough to beguile him into marriage when his resources were still very
moderate and partly uncertain.His friends wished that so ingenious and
agreeable a fellow might have more prosperity than they ventured to hope
for him, their chief regret on his account being that he did not
concentrate his talent and leave off forming opinions on at least
half-a-dozen of the subjects over which he scattered his attention,
especially now that he had married a "nice little woman" (the generic
name for acquaintances' wives when they are not markedly disagreeable).He could not, they observed, want all his various knowledge and Laputan
ideas for his periodical writing which brought him most of his bread,
and he would do well to use his talents in getting a speciality that
would fit him for a post.Perhaps these well-disposed persons were a
little rash in presuming that fitness for a post would be the surest
ground for getting it; and on the whole, in now looking back on their
wishes for Merman, their chief satisfaction must be that those wishes
did not contribute to the actual result.For in an evil hour Merman did concentrate himself.He had for many
years taken into his interest the comparative history of the ancient
civilisations, but it had not preoccupied him so as to narrow his
generous attention to everything else.One sleepless night, however (his
wife has more than once narrated to me the details of an event memorable
to her as the beginning of sorrows), after spending some hours over the
epoch-making work of Grampus, a new idea seized him with regard to the
possible connection of certain symbolic monuments common to widely
scattered races.The night was cold, and the
sudden withdrawal of warmth made his wife first dream of a snowball,
and then cry--

"What is the matter, Proteus?"That fellow Grampus, whose book is cried up as a
revelation, is all wrong about the Magicodumbras and the Zuzumotzis, and
I have got hold of the right clue.""It signifies this, Julia, that if I am right I shall set the world
right; I shall regenerate history; I shall win the mind of Europe to a
new view of social origins; I shall bruise the head of many
superstitions.""Oh no, dear, don't go too far into things.What are the Madicojumbras and Zuzitotzums?I never heard
you talk of them before.What use can it be troubling yourself about
such things?""That is the way, Julia--that is the way wives alienate their husbands,
and make any hearth pleasanter to him than his own!""What _do_ you mean, Proteus?""Why, if a woman will not try to understand her husband's ideas, or at
least to believe that they are of more value than she can understand--if
she is to join anybody who happens to be against him, and suppose he is
a fool because others contradict him--there is an end of our happiness."Oh no, Proteus, dear.I do believe what you say is right That is my
only guide.I am sure I never have any opinions in any other way: I mean
about subjects.Of course there are many little things that would tease
you, that you like me to judge of for myself.I know I said once that I
did not want you to sing 'Oh ruddier than the cherry,' because it was
not in your voice.But I cannot remember ever differing from you about
_subjects_.I never in my life thought any one cleverer than you."Julia Merman was really a "nice little woman," not one of the stately
Dians sometimes spoken of in those terms.Her black _silhouette_ had a
very infantine aspect, but she had discernment and wisdom enough to act
on the strong hint of that memorable conversation, never again giving
her husband the slightest ground for suspecting that she thought
treasonably of his ideas in relation to the Magicodumbras and
Zuzumotzis, or in the least relaxed her faith in his infallibility
because Europe was not also convinced of it.It was well for her that
she did not increase her troubles in this way; but to do her justice,
what she was chiefly anxious about was to avoid increasing her husband's
troubles.In the first development and
writing out of his scheme, Merman had a more intense kind of
intellectual pleasure than he had ever known before.His face became
more radiant, his general view of human prospects more cheerful.Foreseeing that truth as presented by himself would win the recognition
of his contemporaries, he excused with much liberality their rather
rough treatment of other theorists whose basis was less perfect.His own
periodical criticisms had never before been so amiable: he was sorry for
that unlucky majority whom the spirit of the age, or some other
prompting more definite and local, compelled to write without any
particular ideas.The possession of an original theory which has not yet
been assailed must certainly sweeten the temper of a man who is not
beforehand ill-natured.And Merman was the reverse of ill-natured.But the hour of publication came; and to half-a-dozen persons, described
as the learned world of two hemispheres, it became known that Grampus
was attacked.This might have been a small matter; for who or what on
earth that is good for anything is not assailed by ignorance, stupidity,
or malice--and sometimes even by just objection?But on examination it
appeared that the attack might possibly be held damaging, unless the
ignorance of the author were well exposed and his pretended facts shown
to be chimeras of that remarkably hideous kind begotten by imperfect
learning on the more feminine element of original incapacity.Grampus
himself did not immediately cut open the volume which Merman had been
careful to send him, not without a very lively and shifting conception
of the possible effects which the explosive gift might produce on the
too eminent scholar--effects that must certainly have set in on the
third day from the despatch of the parcel.But in point of fact Grampus
knew nothing of the book until his friend Lord Narwhal sent him an
American newspaper containing a spirited article by the well-known
Professor Sperm N. Whale which was rather equivocal in its bearing, the
passages quoted from Merman being of rather a telling sort, and the
paragraphs which seemed to blow defiance being unaccountably feeble,
coming from so distinguished a Cetacean.Then, by another post, arrived
letters from Butzkopf and Dugong, both men whose signatures were
familiar to the Teutonic world in the _Selten-erscheinende
Monat-schrift_ or Hayrick for the insertion of Split Hairs, asking their
Master whether he meant to take up the combat, because, in the contrary
case, both were ready.Thus America and Germany were roused, though England was still drowsy,
and it seemed time now for Grampus to find Merman's book under the heap
and cut it open.For his own part he was perfectly at ease about his
system; but this is a world in which the truth requires defence, and
specious falsehood must be met with exposure.Grampus having once looked
through the book, no longer wanted any urging to write the most crushing
of replies.This, and nothing less than this, was due from him to the
cause of sound inquiry; and the punishment would cost him little pains.In three weeks from that time the palpitating Merman saw his book
announced in the programme of the leading Review.No need for Grampus to
put his signature.Who else had his vast yet microscopic knowledge, who
else his power of epithet?This article in which Merman was pilloried
and as good as mutilated--for he was shown to have neither ear nor nose
for the subtleties of philological and archaeological study--was much
read and more talked of, not because of any interest in the system of
Grampus, or any precise conception of the danger attending lax views of
the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, but because the sharp epigrams with
which the victim was lacerated, and the soaring fountains of acrid mud
which were shot upward and poured over the fresh wounds, were found
amusing in recital.A favourite passage was one in which a certain kind
of sciolist was described as a creature of the Walrus kind, having a
phantasmal resemblance to higher animals when seen by ignorant minds in
the twilight, dabbling or hobbling in first one element and then the
other, without parts or organs suited to either, in fact one of Nature's
impostors who could not be said to have any artful pretences, since a
congenital incompetence to all precision of aim and movement made their
every action a pretence--just as a being born in doeskin gloves would
necessarily pass a judgment on surfaces, but we all know what his
judgment would be worth.In drawing-room circles, and for the immediate
hour, this ingenious comparison was as damaging as the showing up of
Merman's mistakes and the mere smattering of linguistic and historical
knowledge which he had presumed to be a sufficient basis for theorising;
but the more learned cited his blunders aside to each other and laughed
the laugh of the initiated.In fact, Merman's was a remarkable case of
sudden notoriety.In London drums and clubs he was spoken of abundantly
as one who had written ridiculously about the Magicodumbras and
Zuzumotzis: the leaders of conversation, whether Christians, Jews,
infidels, or of any other confession except the confession of ignorance,
pronouncing him shallow and indiscreet if not presumptuous and absurd.He was heard of at Warsaw, and even Paris took knowledge of him.M.
Cachalot had not read either Grampus or Merman, but he heard of their
dispute in time to insert a paragraph upon it in his brilliant work,
_L'orient au point de vue actuel_, in which he was dispassionate enough
to speak of Grampus as possessing a _coup d'oeil presque francais_ in
matters of historical interpretation, and of Merman as nevertheless an
objector _qui merite d'etre connu_.M. Porpesse, also, availing himself
of M. Cachalot's knowledge, reproduced it in an article with certain
additions, which it is only fair to distinguish as his own, implying
that the vigorous English of Grampus was not always as correct as a
Frenchman could desire, while Merman's objections were more sophistical
than solid.Presently, indeed, there appeared an able _extrait_ of
Grampus's article in the valuable _Rapporteur scientifique et
historique_, and Merman's mistakes were thus brought under the notice of
certain Frenchmen who are among the masters of those who know on
oriental subjects.In a word, Merman, though not extensively read, was
extensively read about.Perhaps nobody, except his wife, for a
moment reflected on that.An amused society considered that he was
severely punished, but did not take the trouble to imagine his
sensations; indeed this would have been a difficulty for persons less
sensitive and excitable than Merman himself.Perhaps that popular
comparison of the Walrus had truth enough to bite and blister on
thorough application, even if exultant ignorance had not applauded it.But it is well known that the walrus, though not in the least a
malignant animal, if allowed to display its remarkably plain person and
blundering performances at ease in any element it chooses, becomes
desperately savage and musters alarming auxiliaries when attacked or
hurt.In this characteristic, at least, Merman resembled the walrus.And
now he concentrated himself with a vengeance.That his counter-theory
was fundamentally the right one he had a genuine conviction, whatever
collateral mistakes he might have committed; and his bread would not
cease to be bitter to him until he had convinced his contemporaries that
Grampus had used his minute learning as a dust-cloud to hide
sophistical evasions--that, in fact, minute learning was an obstacle to
clear-sighted judgment, more especially with regard to the Magicodumbras
and Zuzumotzis, and that the best preparation in this matter was a wide
survey of history and a diversified observation of men.Still, Merman
was resolved to muster all the learning within his reach, and he
wandered day and night through many wildernesses of German print, he
tried compendious methods of learning oriental tongues, and, so to
speak, getting at the marrow of languages independently of the bones,
for the chance of finding details to corroborate his own views, or
possibly even to detect Grampus in some oversight or textual tampering.All other work was neglected: rare clients were sent away and amazed
editors found this maniac indifferent to his chance of getting
book-parcels from them.It was many months before Merman had satisfied
himself that he was strong enough to face round upon his adversary.But
at last he had prepared sixty condensed pages of eager argument which
seemed to him worthy to rank with the best models of controversial
writing.He had acknowledged his mistakes, but had restated his theory
so as to show that it was left intact in spite of them; and he had even
found cases in which Ziphius, Microps, Scrag Whale the explorer, and
other Cetaceans of unanswerable authority, were decidedly at issue with
Grampus.Especially a passage cited by this last from that greatest of
fossils Megalosaurus was demonstrated by Merman to be capable of three
different interpretations, all preferable to that chosen by Grampus, who
took the words in their most literal sense; for, 1 deg., the incomparable
Saurian, alike unequalled in close observation and far-glancing
comprehensiveness, might have meant those words ironically; 2 deg., _motzis_
was probably a false reading for _potzis_, in which case its bearing was
reversed; and 3 deg., it is known that in the age of the Saurians there
were conceptions about the _motzis_ which entirely remove it from the
category of things comprehensible in an age when Saurians run
ridiculously small: all which views were godfathered by names quite fit
to be ranked with that of Grampus.In fine, Merman wound up his
rejoinder by sincerely thanking the eminent adversary without whose
fierce assault he might not have undertaken a revision in the course of
which he had met with unexpected and striking confirmations of his own
fundamental views.Evidently Merman's anger was at white heat.The rejoinder being complete, all that remained was to find a suitable
medium for its publication.Distinguished mediums
would not lend themselves to contradictions of Grampus, or if they
would, Merman's article was too long and too abstruse, while he would
not consent to leave anything out of an article which had no
superfluities; for all this happened years ago when the world was at a
different stage.At last, however, he got his rejoinder printed, and not
on hard terms, since the medium, in every sense modest, did not ask him
to pay for its insertion.But if Merman expected to call out Grampus again, he was mistaken.Everybody felt it too absurd that Merman should undertake to correct
Grampus in matters of erudition, and an eminent man has something else
to do than to refute a petty objector twice over.What was essential had
been done: the public had been enabled to form a true judgment of
Merman's incapacity, the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis were but
subsidiary elements in Grampus's system, and Merman might now be dealt
with by younger members of the master's school.But he had at least the
satisfaction of finding that he had raised a discussion which would not
be let die.The followers of Grampus took it up with an ardour and
industry of research worthy of their exemplar.Butzkopf made it the
subject of an elaborate _Einleitung_ to his important work, _Die
Bedeutung des Aegyptischen Labyrinthes_; and Dugong, in a remarkable
address which he delivered to a learned society in Central Europe,
introduced Merman's theory with so much power of sarcasm that it became
a theme of more or less derisive allusion to men of many tongues.Merman
with his Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis was on the way to become a
proverb, being used illustratively by many able journalists who took
those names of questionable things to be Merman's own invention, "than
which," said one of the graver guides, "we can recall few more
melancholy examples of speculative aberration."Naturally the subject
passed into popular literature, and figured very commonly in advertised
programmes.The fluent Loligo, the formidable Shark, and a younger
member of his remarkable family known as S. Catulus, made a special
reputation by their numerous articles, eloquent, lively, or abusive, all
on the same theme, under titles ingeniously varied, alliterative,
sonorous, or boldly fanciful; such as, "Moments with Mr Merman," "Mr
Merman and the Magicodumbras," "Greenland Grampus and Proteus Merman,"
"Grampian Heights and their Climbers, or the New Excelsior."They tossed
him on short sentences; they swathed him in paragraphs of winding
imagery; they found him at once a mere plagiarist and a theoriser of
unexampled perversity, ridiculously wrong about _potzis_ and ignorant of
Pali; they hinted, indeed, at certain things which to their knowledge he
had silently brooded over in his boyhood, and seemed tolerably well
assured that this preposterous attempt to gainsay an incomparable
Cetacean of world-wide fame had its origin in a peculiar mixture of
bitterness and eccentricity which, rightly estimated and seen in its
definite proportions, would furnish the best key to his argumentation.All alike were sorry for Merman's lack of sound learning, but how could
their readers be sorry?Sound learning would not have been amusing; and
as it was, Merman was made to furnish these readers with amusement at no
expense of trouble on their part.Even burlesque writers looked into his
book to see where it could be made use of, and those who did not know
him were desirous of meeting him at dinner as one likely to feed their
comic vein.On the other hand, he made a serious figure in sermons under the name of
"Some" or "Others" who had attempted presumptuously to scale eminences
too high and arduous for human ability, and had given an example of
ignominious failure edifying to the humble Christian.All this might be very advantageous for able persons whose superfluous
fund of expression needed a paying investment, but the effect on Merman
himself was unhappily not so transient as the busy writing and speaking
of which he had become the occasion.His certainty that he was right
naturally got stronger in proportion as the spirit of resistance was
stimulated.The scorn and unfairness with which he felt himself to have
been treated by those really competent to appreciate his ideas had
galled him and made a chronic sore; and the exultant chorus of the
incompetent seemed a pouring of vinegar on his wound.His brain became a
registry of the foolish and ignorant objections made against him, and of
continually amplified answers to these objections.Unable to get his
answers printed, he had recourse to that more primitive mode of
publication, oral transmission or button-holding, now generally regarded
as a troublesome survival, and the once pleasant, flexible Merman was on
the way to be shunned as a bore.His interest in new acquaintances
turned chiefly on the possibility that they would care about the
Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis; that they would listen to his complaints
and exposures of unfairness, and not only accept copies of what he had
written on the subject, but send him appreciative letters in
acknowledgment.Repeated disappointment of such hopes tended to embitter
him, and not the less because after a while the fashion of mentioning
him died out, allusions to his theory were less understood, and people
could only pretend to remember it.And all the while Merman was
perfectly sure that his very opponents who had knowledge enough to be
capable judges were aware that his book, whatever errors of statement
they might detect in it, had served as a sort of divining rod, pointing
out hidden sources of historical interpretation; nay, his jealous
examination discerned in a new work by Grampus himself a certain
shifting of ground which--so poor Merman declared--was the sign of an
intention gradually to appropriate the views of the man he had attempted
to brand as an ignorant impostor.And the housekeeping?--the rent, food, and clothing, which
controversy can hardly supply unless it be of the kind that serves as a
recommendation to certain posts.Controversial pamphlets have been known
to earn large plums; but nothing of the sort could be expected from
unpractical heresies about the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis.Merman's reputation as a sober thinker, a safe writer, a
sound lawyer, was irretrievably injured: the distractions of controversy
had caused him to neglect useful editorial connections, and indeed his
dwindling care for miscellaneous subjects made his contributions too
dull to be desirable.Even if he could now have given a new turn to his
concentration, and applied his talents so as to be ready to show himself
an exceptionally qualified lawyer, he would only have been like an
architect in competition, too late with his superior plans; he would not
have had an opportunity of showing his qualification.The small capital which had filled up deficiencies of
income was almost exhausted, and Julia, in the effort to make supplies
equal to wants, had to use much ingenuity in diminishing the wants.The
brave and affectionate woman whose small outline, so unimpressive
against an illuminated background, held within it a good share of
feminine heroism, did her best to keep up the charm of home and soothe
her husband's excitement; parting with the best jewel among her wedding
presents in order to pay rent, without ever hinting to her husband that
this sad result had come of his undertaking to convince people who only
laughed at him.She was a resigned little creature, and reflected that
some husbands took to drinking and others to forgery: hers had only
taken to the Magicodumbras and Zuzumotzis, and was not unkind--only a
little more indifferent to her and the two children than she had ever
expected he would be, his mind being eaten up with "subjects," and
constantly a little angry, not with her, but with everybody else,
especially those who were celebrated.Merman felt himself ill-used by the world, and
thought very much worse of the world in consequence.The gall of his
adversaries' ink had been sucked into his system and ran in his blood.He was still in the prime of life, but his mind was aged by that eager
monotonous construction which comes of feverish excitement on a single
topic and uses up the intellectual strength.Merman had never been a rich man, but he was now conspicuously poor, and
in need of the friends who had power or interest which he believed they
could exert on his behalf.Their omitting or declining to give this help
could not seem to him so clearly as to them an inevitable consequence of
his having become impracticable, or at least of his passing for a man
whose views were not likely to be safe and sober.Each friend in turn
offended him, though unwillingly, and was suspected of wishing to shake
him off.It was not altogether so; but poor Merman's society had
undeniably ceased to be attractive, and it was difficult to help him.At
last the pressure of want urged him to try for a post far beneath his
earlier prospects, and he gained it.He holds it still, for he has no
vices, and his domestic life has kept up a sweetening current of motive
around and within him.Nevertheless, the bitter flavour mingling itself
with all topics, the premature weariness and withering, are irrevocably
there.It is as if he had gone through a disease which alters what we
call the constitution.He has long ceased to talk eagerly of the ideas
which possess him, or to attempt making proselytes.The dial has moved
onward, and he himself sees many of his former guesses in a new light.On the other hand, he has seen what he foreboded, that the main idea
which was at the root of his too rash theorising has been adopted by
Grampus and received with general respect, no reference being heard to
the ridiculous figure this important conception made when ushered in by
the incompetent "Others."Now and then, on rare occasions, when a sympathetic _tete-a-tete_ has
restored some of his old expansiveness, he will tell a companion in a
railway carriage, or other place of meeting favourable to
autobiographical confidences, what has been the course of things in his
particular case, as an example of the justice to be expected of the
world.The companion usually allows for the bitterness of a disappointed
man, and is secretly disinclined to believe that Grampus was to blame.A MAN SURPRISED AT HIS ORIGINALITY.Among the many acute sayings of La Rochefoucauld, there is hardly one
more acute than this: "La plus grande ambition n'en a pas la moindre
apparence lorsqu'elle se rencontre dans une impossibilite absolue
d'arriver ou elle aspire."Some of us might do well to use this hint in
our treatment of acquaintances and friends from whom we are expecting
gratitude because we are so very kind in thinking of them, inviting
them, and even listening to what they say--considering how insignificant
they must feel themselves to be.We are often fallaciously confident in
supposing that our friend's state of mind is appropriate to our moderate
estimate of his importance: almost as if we imagined the humble mollusc
(so useful as an illustration) to have a sense of his own exceeding
softness and low place in the scale of being.Your mollusc, on the
contrary, is inwardly objecting to every other grade of solid rather
than to himself.Accustomed to observe what we think an unwarrantable
conceit exhibiting itself in ridiculous pretensions and forwardness to
play the lion's part, in obvious self-complacency and loud
peremptoriness, we are not on the alert to detect the egoistic claims of
a more exorbitant kind often hidden under an apparent neutrality or an
acquiescence in being put out of the question.Thoughts of this kind occurred to me yesterday when I saw the name of
Lentulus in the obituary.The majority of his acquaintances, I imagine,
have always thought of him as a man justly unpretending and as nobody's
rival; but some of them have perhaps been struck with surprise at his
reserve in praising the works of his contemporaries, and have now and
then felt themselves in need of a key to his remarks on men of celebrity
in various departments.He was a man of fair position, deriving his
income from a business in which he did nothing, at leisure to frequent
clubs and at ease in giving dinners; well-looking, polite, and generally
acceptable in society as a part of what we may call its bread-crumb--the
neutral basis needful for the plums and spice.Why, then, did he speak
of the modern Maro or the modern Flaccus with a peculiarity in his tone
of assent to other people's praise which might almost have led you to
suppose that the eminent poet had borrowed money of him and showed an
indisposition to repay?He had no criticism to offer, no sign of
objection more specific than a slight cough, a scarcely perceptible
pause before assenting, and an air of self-control in his utterance--as
if certain considerations had determined him not to inform against the
so-called poet, who to his knowledge was a mere versifier.If you had
questioned him closely, he would perhaps have confessed that he did
think something better might be done in the way of Eclogues and
Georgics, or of Odes and Epodes, and that to his mind poetry was
something very different from what had hitherto been known under that
name.For my own part, being of a superstitious nature, given readily to
imagine alarming causes, I immediately, on first getting these mystic
hints from Lentulus, concluded that he held a number of entirely
original poems, or at the very least a revolutionary treatise on
poetics, in that melancholy manuscript state to which works excelling
all that is ever printed are necessarily condemned; and I was long timid
in speaking of the poets when he was present.For what might not
Lentulus have done, or be profoundly aware of, that would make my
ignorant impressions ridiculous?One cannot well be sure of the negative
in such a case, except through certain positives that bear witness to
it; and those witnesses are not always to be got hold of.But time
wearing on, I perceived that the attitude of Lentulus towards the
philosophers was essentially the same as his attitude towards the poets;
nay, there was something so much more decided in his mode of closing his
mouth after brief speech on the former, there was such an air of rapt
consciousness in his private hints as to his conviction that all
thinking hitherto had been an elaborate mistake, and as to his own
power of conceiving a sound basis for a lasting superstructure, that I
began to believe less in the poetical stores, and to infer that the line
of Lentulus lay rather in the rational criticism of our beliefs and in
systematic construction.In this case I did not figure to myself the
existence of formidable manuscripts ready for the press; for great
thinkers are known to carry their theories growing within their minds
long before committing them to paper, and the ideas which made a new
passion for them when their locks were jet or auburn, remain perilously
unwritten, an inwardly developing condition of their successive selves,
until the locks are grey or scanty.I only meditated improvingly on the
way in which a man of exceptional faculties, and even carrying within
him some of that fierce refiner's fire which is to purge away the dross
of human error, may move about in society totally unrecognised, regarded
as a person whose opinion is superfluous, and only rising into a power
in emergencies of threatened black-balling.Imagine a Descartes or a
Locke being recognised for nothing more than a good fellow and a
perfect gentleman--what a painful view does such a picture suggest of
impenetrable dulness in the society around them!I would at all times rather be reduced to a cheaper estimate of a
particular person, if by that means I can get a more cheerful view of my
fellow-men generally; and I confess that in a certain curiosity which
led me to cultivate Lentulus's acquaintance, my hope leaned to the
discovery that he was a less remarkable man than he had seemed to imply.It would have been a grief to discover that he was bitter or malicious,
but by finding him to be neither a mighty poet, nor a revolutionary
poetical critic, nor an epoch-making philosopher, my admiration for the
poets and thinkers whom he rated so low would recover all its buoyancy,
and I should not be left to trust to that very suspicious sort of merit
which constitutes an exception in the history of mankind, and recommends
itself as the total abolitionist of all previous claims on our
confidence.You are not greatly surprised at the infirm logic of the
coachman who would persuade you to engage him by insisting that any
other would be sure to rob you in the matter of hay and corn, thus
demanding a difficult belief in him as the sole exception from the
frailties of his calling; but it is rather astonishing that the
wholesale decriers of mankind and its performances should be even more
unwary in their reasoning than the coachman, since each of them not
merely confides in your regarding himself as an exception, but overlooks
the almost certain fact that you are wondering whether he inwardly
excepts _you_.Now, conscious of entertaining some common opinions which
seemed to fall under the mildly intimated but sweeping ban of Lentulus,
my self-complacency was a little concerned.Hence I deliberately attempted to draw out Lentulus in private dialogue,
for it is the reverse of injury to a man to offer him that hearing which
he seems to have found nowhere else.And for whatever purposes silence
may be equal to gold, it cannot be safely taken as an indication of
specific ideas.I sought to know why Lentulus was more than indifferent
to the poets, and what was that new poetry which he had either written
or, as to its principles, distinctly conceived.But I presently found
that he knew very little of any particular poet, and had a general
notion of poetry as the use of artificial language to express unreal
sentiments: he instanced "The Giaour," "Lalla Rookh," "The Pleasures of
Hope," and "Ruin seize thee, ruthless King;" adding, "and plenty more."On my observing that he probably preferred a larger, simpler style, he
emphatically assented."Have you not," said I, "written something of
that order?""No; but I often compose as I go along.I see how things
might be written as fine as Ossian, only with true ideas.The world has
no notion what poetry will be."It was impossible to disprove this, and I am always glad to believe that
the poverty of our imagination is no measure of the world's resources.Our posterity will no doubt get fuel in ways that we are unable to
devise for them.But what this conversation persuaded me of was, that
the birth with which the mind of Lentulus was pregnant could not be
poetry, though I did not question that he composed as he went along, and
that the exercise was accompanied with a great sense of power.This is a
frequent experience in dreams, and much of our waking experience is but
a dream in the daylight.Nay, for what I saw, the compositions might be
fairly classed as Ossianic.But I was satisfied that Lentulus could not
disturb my grateful admiration for the poets of all ages by eclipsing
them, or by putting them under a new electric light of criticism.Still, he had himself thrown the chief emphasis of his protest and his
consciousness of corrective illumination on the philosophic thinking of
our race; and his tone in assuring me that everything which had been
done in that way was wrong--that Plato, Robert Owen, and Dr Tuffle who
wrote in the 'Regulator,' were all equally mistaken--gave my
superstitious nature a thrill of anxiety.After what had passed about
the poets, it did not seem likely that Lentulus had all systems by
heart; but who could say he had not seized that thread which may
somewhere hang out loosely from the web of things and be the clue of
unravelment?We need not go far to learn that a prophet is not made by
erudition.Lentulus at least had not the bias of a school; and if it
turned out that he was in agreement with any celebrated thinker,
ancient or modern, the agreement would have the value of an undesigned
coincidence not due to forgotten reading.It was therefore with renewed
curiosity that I engaged him on this large subject--the universal
erroneousness of thinking up to the period when Lentulus began that
process.And here I found him more copious than on the theme of poetry.He admitted that he did contemplate writing down his thoughts, but his
difficulty was their abundance.Apparently he was like the woodcutter
entering the thick forest and saying, "Where shall I begin?"The same
obstacle appeared in a minor degree to cling about his verbal
exposition, and accounted perhaps for his rather helter-skelter choice
of remarks bearing on the number of unaddressed letters sent to the
post-office; on what logic really is, as tending to support the buoyancy
of human mediums and mahogany tables; on the probability of all miracles
under all religions when explained by hidden laws, and my
unreasonableness in supposing that their profuse occurrence at half a
guinea an hour in recent times was anything more than a coincidence; on
the haphazard way in which marriages are determined--showing the
baselessness of social and moral schemes; and on his expectation that he
should offend the scientific world when he told them what he thought of
electricity as an agent.No man's appearance could be graver or more gentleman-like than that of
Lentulus as we walked along the Mall while he delivered these
observations, understood by himself to have a regenerative bearing on
human society.His wristbands and black gloves, his hat and nicely
clipped hair, his laudable moderation in beard, and his evident
discrimination in choosing his tailor, all seemed to excuse the
prevalent estimate of him as a man untainted with heterodoxy, and likely
to be so unencumbered with opinions that he would always be useful as an
assenting and admiring listener.Men of science seeing him at their
lectures doubtless flattered themselves that he came to learn from them;
the philosophic ornaments of our time, expounding some of their luminous
ideas in the social circle, took the meditative gaze of Lentulus for one
of surprise not unmixed with a just reverence at such close reasoning
towards so novel a conclusion; and those who are called men of the
world considered him a good fellow who might be asked to vote for a
friend of their own and would have no troublesome notions to make him
unaccommodating.You perceive how very much they were all mistaken,
except in qualifying him as a good fellow.This Lentulus certainly was, in the sense of being free from envy,
hatred, and malice; and such freedom was all the more remarkable an
indication of native benignity, because of his gaseous, illimitably
expansive conceit.Yes, conceit; for that his enormous and contentedly
ignorant confidence in his own rambling thoughts was usually clad in a
decent silence, is no reason why it should be less strictly called by
the name directly implying a complacent self-estimate unwarranted by
performance.Nay, the total privacy in which he enjoyed his
consciousness of inspiration was the very condition of its undisturbed
placid nourishment and gigantic growth.Your audibly arrogant man
exposes himself to tests: in attempting to make an impression on others
he may possibly (not always) be made to feel his own lack of
definiteness; and the demand for definiteness is to all of us a needful
check on vague depreciation of what others do, and vague ecstatic trust
in our own superior ability.But Lentulus was at once so unreceptive,
and so little gifted with the power of displaying his miscellaneous
deficiency of information, that there was really nothing to hinder his
astonishment at the spontaneous crop of ideas which his mind secretly
yielded.If it occurred to him that there were more meanings than one
for the word "motive," since it sometimes meant the end aimed at and
sometimes the feeling that prompted the aiming, and that the word
"cause" was also of changeable import, he was naturally struck with the
truth of his own perception, and was convinced that if this vein were
well followed out much might be made of it.Men were evidently in the
wrong about cause and effect, else why was society in the confused state
we behold?And as to motive, Lentulus felt that when he came to write
down his views he should look deeply into this kind of subject and show
up thereby the anomalies of our social institutions; meanwhile the
various aspects of "motive" and "cause" flitted about among the motley
crowd of ideas which he regarded as original, and pregnant with
reformative efficacy.For his unaffected goodwill made him regard all
his insight as only valuable because it tended towards reform.The respectable man had got into his illusory maze of discoveries by
letting go that clue of conformity in his thinking which he had kept
fast hold of in his tailoring and manners.He regarded heterodoxy as a
power in itself, and took his inacquaintance with doctrines for a
creative dissidence.But his epitaph needs not to be a melancholy one.His benevolent disposition was more effective for good than his silent
presumption for harm.He might have been mischievous but for the lack of
words: instead of being astonished at his inspirations in private, he
might have clad his addled originalities, disjointed commonplaces, blind
denials, and balloon-like conclusions, in that mighty sort of language
which would have made a new Koran for a knot of followers.I mean no
disrespect to the ancient Koran, but one would not desire the roc to lay
more eggs and give us a whole wing-flapping brood to soar and make
twilight.Peace be with Lentulus, for he has left us in peace.Blessed is the man
who, having nothing to say, abstains from giving us wordy evidence of
the fact--from calling on us to look through a heap of millet-seed in
order to be sure that there is no pearl in it.V.


A TOO DEFERENTIAL MAN.A little unpremeditated insincerity must be indulged under the stress of
social intercourse.The talk even of an honest man must often represent
merely his wish to be inoffensive or agreeable rather than his genuine
opinion or feeling on the matter in hand.His thought, if uttered, might
be wounding; or he has not the ability to utter it with exactness and
snatches at a loose paraphrase; or he has really no genuine thought on
the question and is driven to fill up the vacancy by borrowing the
remarks in vogue.These are the winds and currents we have all to steer
amongst, and they are often too strong for our truthfulness or our wit.Let us not bear too hardly on each other for this common incidental
frailty, or think that we rise superior to it by dropping all
considerateness and deference.But there are studious, deliberate forms of insincerity which it is fair
to be impatient with: Hinze's, for example.From his name you might
suppose him to be German: in fact, his family is Alsatian, but has been
settled in England for more than one generation.He is the superlatively
deferential man, and walks about with murmured wonder at the wisdom and
discernment of everybody who talks to him.He cultivates the low-toned
_tete-a-tete,_ keeping his hat carefully in his hand and often stroking
it, while he smiles with downcast eyes, as if to relieve his feelings
under the pressure of the remarkable conversation which it is his honour
to enjoy at the present moment.I confess to some rage on hearing him
yesterday talking to Felicia, who is certainly a clever woman, and,
without any unusual desire to show her cleverness, occasionally says
something of her own or makes an allusion which is not quite common.Still, it must happen to her as to every one else to speak of many
subjects on which the best things were said long ago, and in
conversation with a person who has been newly introduced those
well-worn themes naturally recur as a further development of salutations
and preliminary media of understanding, such as pipes, chocolate, or
mastic-chewing, which serve to confirm the impression that our new
acquaintance is on a civilised footing and has enough regard for
formulas to save us from shocking outbursts of individualism, to which
we are always exposed with the tamest bear or baboon.Considered purely
as a matter of information, it cannot any longer be important for us to
learn that a British subject included in the last census holds Shakspere
to be supreme in the presentation of character; still, it is as
admissible for any one to make this statement about himself as to rub
his hands and tell you that the air is brisk, if only he will let it
fall as a matter of course, with a parenthetic lightness, and not
announce his adhesion to a commonplace with an emphatic insistance, as
if it were a proof of singular insight.We mortals should chiefly like
to talk to each other out of goodwill and fellowship, not for the sake
of hearing revelations or being stimulated by witticisms; and I have
usually found that it is the rather dull person who appears to be
disgusted with his contemporaries because they are not always strikingly
original, and to satisfy whom the party at a country house should have
included the prophet Isaiah, Plato, Francis Bacon, and Voltaire.It is
always your heaviest bore who is astonished at the tameness of modern
celebrities: naturally; for a little of his company has reduced them to
a state of flaccid fatigue.It is right and meet that there should be an
abundant utterance of good sound commonplaces.Part of an agreeable
talker's charm is that he lets them fall continually with no more than
their due emphasis.Giving a pleasant voice to what we are all well
assured of, makes a sort of wholesome air for more special and dubious
remark to move in.Hence it seemed to me far from unbecoming in Felicia that in her first
dialogue with Hinze, previously quite a stranger to her, her
observations were those of an ordinarily refined and well-educated woman
on standard subjects, and might have been printed in a manual of polite
topics and creditable opinions.She had no desire to astonish a man of
whom she had heard nothing particular.It was all the more exasperating
to see and hear Hinze's reception of her well-bred conformities.Felicia's acquaintances know her as the suitable wife of a distinguished
man, a sensible, vivacious, kindly-disposed woman, helping her husband
with graceful apologies written and spoken, and making her receptions
agreeable to all comers.But you would have imagined that Hinze had been
prepared by general report to regard this introduction to her as an
opportunity comparable to an audience of the Delphic Sibyl.When she had
delivered herself on the changes in Italian travel, on the difficulty of
reading Ariosto in these busy times, on the want of equilibrium in
French political affairs, and on the pre-eminence of German music, he
would know what to think.Felicia was evidently embarrassed by his
reverent wonder, and, in dread lest she should seem to be playing the
oracle, became somewhat confused, stumbling on her answers rather than
choosing them.But this made no difference to Hinze's rapt attention and
subdued eagerness of inquiry.He continued to put large questions,
bending his head slightly that his eyes might be a little lifted in
awaiting her reply."What, may I ask, is your opinion as to the state of Art in England?""Oh," said Felicia, with a light deprecatory laugh, "I think it suffers
from two diseases--bad taste in the patrons and want of inspiration in
the artists.""That is true indeed," said Hinze, in an undertone of deep conviction."You have put your finger with strict accuracy on the causes of decline.To a cultivated taste like yours this must be particularly painful.""I did not say there was actual decline," said Felicia, with a touch of
_brusquerie_."I don't set myself up as the great personage whom nothing
can please.""That would be too severe a misfortune for others," says my
complimentary ape."You approve, perhaps, of Rosemary's 'Babes in the
Wood,' as something fresh and _naive_ in sculpture?"Or _will_ you permit me to tell him?"It would be an impertinence in me to praise a work of
his--to pronounce on its quality; and that I happen to like it can be of
no consequence to him."Here was an occasion for Hinze to smile down on his hat and stroke
it--Felicia's ignorance that her praise was inestimable being peculiarly
noteworthy to an observer of mankind.Presently he was quite sure that
her favourite author was Shakspere, and wished to know what she thought
of Hamlet's madness.When she had quoted Wilhelm Meister on this point,
and had afterwards testified that "Lear" was beyond adequate
presentation, that "Julius Caesar" was an effective acting play, and
that a poet may know a good deal about human nature while knowing little
of geography, Hinze appeared so impressed with the plenitude of these
revelations that he recapitulated them, weaving them together with
threads of compliment--"As you very justly observed;" and--"It is most
true, as you say;" and--"It were well if others noted what you have
remarked."Some listeners incautious in their epithets would have called Hinze an
"ass."For my part I would never insult that intelligent and
unpretending animal who no doubt brays with perfect simplicity and
substantial meaning to those acquainted with his idiom, and if he feigns
more submission than he feels, has weighty reasons for doing so--I would
never, I say, insult that historic and ill-appreciated animal, the ass,
by giving his name to a man whose continuous pretence is so shallow in
its motive, so unexcused by any sharp appetite as this of Hinze's.But perhaps you would say that his adulatory manner was originally
adopted under strong promptings of self-interest, and that his absurdly
over-acted deference to persons from whom he expects no patronage is the
unreflecting persistence of habit--just as those who live with the deaf
will shout to everybody else.And you might indeed imagine that in talking to Tulpian, who has
considerable interest at his disposal, Hinze had a desired appointment
in his mind.Tulpian is appealed to on innumerable subjects, and if he
is unwilling to express himself on any one of them, says so with
instructive copiousness: he is much listened to, and his utterances are
registered and reported with more or less exactitude.But I think he
has no other listener who comports himself as Hinze does--who,
figuratively speaking, carries about a small spoon ready to pick up any
dusty crumb of opinion that the eloquent man may have let drop.Tulpian,
with reverence be it said, has some rather absurd notions, such as a
mind of large discourse often finds room for: they slip about among his
higher conceptions and multitudinous acquirements like disreputable
characters at a national celebration in some vast cathedral, where to
the ardent soul all is glorified by rainbow light and grand
associations: any vulgar detective knows them for what they are.But
Hinze is especially fervid in his desire to hear Tulpian dilate on his
crotchets, and is rather troublesome to bystanders in asking them
whether they have read the various fugitive writings in which these
crotchets have been published.If an expert is explaining some matter on
which you desire to know the evidence, Hinze teases you with Tulpian's
guesses, and asks the expert what he thinks of them.In general, Hinze delights in the citation of opinions, and would
hardly remark that the sun shone without an air of respectful appeal or
fervid adhesion.The 'Iliad,' one sees, would impress him little if it
were not for what Mr Fugleman has lately said about it; and if you
mention an image or sentiment in Chaucer he seems not to heed the
bearing of your reference, but immediately tells you that Mr Hautboy,
too, regards Chaucer as a poet of the first order, and he is delighted
to find that two such judges as you and Hautboy are at one.What is the reason of all this subdued ecstasy, moving about, hat in
hand, with well-dressed hair and attitudes of unimpeachable correctness?Some persons conscious of sagacity decide at once that Hinze knows what
he is about in flattering Tulpian, and has a carefully appraised end to
serve though they may not see it They are misled by the common mistake
of supposing that men's behaviour, whether habitual or occasional, is
chiefly determined by a distinctly conceived motive, a definite object
to be gained or a definite evil to be avoided.The truth is, that, the
primitive wants of nature once tolerably satisfied, the majority of
mankind, even in a civilised life full of solicitations, are with
difficulty aroused to the distinct conception of an object towards which
they will direct their actions with careful adaptation, and it is yet
rarer to find one who can persist in the systematic pursuit of such an
end.Few lives are shaped, few characters formed, by the contemplation
of definite consequences seen from a distance and made the goal of
continuous effort or the beacon of a constantly avoided danger: such
control by foresight, such vivid picturing and practical logic are the
distinction of exceptionally strong natures; but society is chiefly made
up of human beings whose daily acts are all performed either in
unreflecting obedience to custom and routine or from immediate
promptings of thought or feeling to execute an immediate purpose.They
pay their poor-rates, give their vote in affairs political or parochial,
wear a certain amount of starch, hinder boys from tormenting the
helpless, and spend money on tedious observances called pleasures,
without mentally adjusting these practices to their own well-understood
interest or to the general, ultimate welfare of the human race; and when
they fall into ungraceful compliment, excessive smiling or other
luckless efforts of complaisant behaviour, these are but the tricks or
habits gradually formed under the successive promptings of a wish to be
agreeable, stimulated day by day without any widening resources for
gratifying the wish.It does not in the least follow that they are
seeking by studied hypocrisy to get something for themselves.And so
with Hinze's deferential bearing, complimentary parentheses, and
worshipful tones, which seem to some like the over-acting of a part in a
comedy.He expects no appointment or other appreciable gain through
Tulpian's favour; he has no doubleness towards Felicia; there is no
sneering or backbiting obverse to his ecstatic admiration.He is very
well off in the world, and cherishes no unsatisfied ambition that could
feed design and direct flattery.As you perceive, he has had the
education and other advantages of a gentleman without being conscious of
marked result, such as a decided preference for any particular ideas or
functions: his mind is furnished as hotels are, with everything for
occasional and transient use.But one cannot be an Englishman and
gentleman in general: it is in the nature of things that one must have
an individuality, though it may be of an often-repeated type.As Hinze
in growing to maturity had grown into a particular form and expression
of person, so he necessarily gathered a manner and frame of speech which
made him additionally recognisable.His nature is not tuned to the pitch
of a genuine direct admiration, only to an attitudinising deference
which does not fatigue itself with the formation of real judgments.All
human achievement must be wrought down to this spoon-meat--this mixture
of other persons' washy opinions and his own flux of reverence for what
is third-hand, before Hinze can find a relish for it.He has no more leading characteristic than the desire to stand well with
those who are justly distinguished; he has no base admirations, and you
may know by his entire presentation of himself, from the management of
his hat to the angle at which he keeps his right foot, that he aspires
to correctness.Desiring to behave becomingly and also to make a figure
in dialogue, he is only like the bad artist whose picture is a failure.We may pity these ill-gifted strivers, but not pretend that their works
are pleasant to behold.A man is bound to know something of his own
weight and muscular dexterity, and the puny athlete is called foolish
before he is seen to be thrown.Hinze has not the stuff in him to be at
once agreeably conversational and sincere, and he has got himself up to
be at all events agreeably conversational.Notwithstanding this
deliberateness of intention in his talk he is unconscious of falsity,
for he has not enough of deep and lasting impression to find a contrast
or diversity between his words and his thoughts.He is not fairly to be
called a hypocrite, but I have already confessed to the more
exasperation at his make-believe reverence, because it has no deep
hunger to excuse it.Its primary meaning, the proportion and mode in which
qualities are mingled, is much neglected in popular speech, yet even
here the word often carries a reference to an habitual state or general
tendency of the organism in distinction from what are held to be
specific virtues and vices.As people confess to bad memory without
expecting to sink in mental reputation, so we hear a man declared to
have a bad temper and yet glorified as the possessor of every high
quality.When he errs or in any way commits himself, his temper is
accused, not his character, and it is understood that but for a brutal
bearish mood he is kindness itself.If he kicks small animals, swears
violently at a servant who mistakes orders, or is grossly rude to his
wife, it is remarked apologetically that these things mean nothing--they
are all temper.Certainly there is a limit to this form of apology, and the forgery of a
bill, or the ordering of goods without any prospect of paying for them,
has never been set down to an unfortunate habit of sulkiness or of
irascibility.But on the whole there is a peculiar exercise of
indulgence towards the manifestations of bad temper which tends to
encourage them, so that we are in danger of having among us a number of
virtuous persons who conduct themselves detestably, just as we have
hysterical patients who, with sound organs, are apparently labouring
under many sorts of organic disease.Let it be admitted, however, that a
man may be "a good fellow" and yet have a bad temper, so bad that we
recognise his merits with reluctance, and are inclined to resent his
occasionally amiable behaviour as an unfair demand on our admiration.He is by turns insolent,
quarrelsome, repulsively haughty to innocent people who approach him
with respect, neglectful of his friends, angry in face of legitimate
demands, procrastinating in the fulfilment of such demands, prompted to
rude words and harsh looks by a moody disgust with his fellow-men in
general--and yet, as everybody will assure you, the soul of honour, a
steadfast friend, a defender of the oppressed, an affectionate-hearted
creature.Pity that, after a certain experience of his moods, his
intimacy becomes insupportable!A man who uses his balmorals to tread on
your toes with much frequency and an unmistakeable emphasis may prove a
fast friend in adversity, but meanwhile your adversity has not arrived
and your toes are tender.The daily sneer or growl at your remarks is
not to be made amends for by a possible eulogy or defence of your
understanding against depredators who may not present themselves, and on
an occasion which may never arise.I cannot submit to a chronic state of
blue and green bruise as a form of insurance against an accident.Touchwood's bad temper is of the contradicting pugnacious sort.He is
the honourable gentleman in opposition, whatever proposal or proposition
may be broached, and when others join him he secretly damns their
superfluous agreement, quickly discovering that his way of stating the
case is not exactly theirs.An invitation or any sign of expectation
throws him into an attitude of refusal.Ask his concurrence in a
benevolent measure: he will not decline to give it, because he has a
real sympathy with good aims; but he complies resentfully, though where
he is let alone he will do much more than any one would have thought of
asking for.No man would shrink with greater sensitiveness from the
imputation of not paying his debts, yet when a bill is sent in with any
promptitude he is inclined to make the tradesman wait for the money he
is in such a hurry to get.One sees that this antagonistic temper must
be much relieved by finding a particular object, and that its worst
moments must be those where the mood is that of vague resistance, there
being nothing specific to oppose.Touchwood is never so little engaging
as when he comes down to breakfast with a cloud on his brow, after
parting from you the night before with an affectionate effusiveness at
the end of a confidential conversation which has assured you of mutual
understanding.Impossible that you can have committed any offence.If
mice have disturbed him, that is not your fault; but, nevertheless, your
cheerful greeting had better not convey any reference to the weather,
else it will be met by a sneer which, taking you unawares, may give you
a crushing sense that you make a poor figure with your cheerfulness,
which was not asked for.Some daring person perhaps introduces another
topic, and uses the delicate flattery of appealing to Touchwood for his
opinion, the topic being included in his favourite studies.An
indistinct muttering, with a look at the carving-knife in reply, teaches
that daring person how ill he has chosen a market for his deference.If
Touchwood's behaviour affects you very closely you had better break your
leg in the course of the day: his bad temper will then vanish at once;
he will take a painful journey on your behalf; he will sit up with you
night after night; he will do all the work of your department so as to
save you from any loss in consequence of your accident; he will be even
uniformly tender to you till you are well on your legs again, when he
will some fine morning insult you without provocation, and make you wish
that his generous goodness to you had not closed your lips against
retort.It is not always necessary that a friend should break his leg for
Touchwood to feel compunction and endeavour to make amends for his
bearishness or insolence.He becomes spontaneously conscious that he has
misbehaved, and he is not only ashamed of himself, but has the better
prompting to try and heal any wound he has inflicted.Unhappily the
habit of being offensive "without meaning it" leads usually to a way of
making amends which the injured person cannot but regard as a being
amiable without meaning it.The kindnesses, the complimentary
indications or assurances, are apt to appear in the light of a penance
adjusted to the foregoing lapses, and by the very contrast they offer
call up a keener memory of the wrong they atone for.They are not a
spontaneous prompting of goodwill, but an elaborate compensation.And,
in fact, Dion's atoning friendliness has a ring of artificiality.Because he formerly disguised his good feeling towards you he now
expresses more than he quite feels.Having made you
extremely uncomfortable last week he has absolutely diminished his
power of making you happy to-day: he struggles against this result by
excessive effort, but he has taught you to observe his fitfulness rather
than to be warmed by his episodic show of regard.I suspect that many persons who have an uncertain, incalculable temper
flatter themselves that it enhances their fascination; but perhaps they
are under the prior mistake of exaggerating the charm which they suppose
to be thus strengthened; in any case they will do well not to trust in
the attractions of caprice and moodiness for a long continuance or for
close intercourse.A pretty woman may fan the flame of distant adorers
by harassing them, but if she lets one of them make her his wife, the
point of view from which he will look at her poutings and tossings and
mysterious inability to be pleased will be seriously altered.And if
slavery to a pretty woman, which seems among the least conditional forms
of abject service, will not bear too great a strain from her bad temper
even though her beauty remain the same, it is clear that a man whose
claims lie in his high character or high performances had need impress
us very constantly with his peculiar value and indispensableness, if he
is to test our patience by an uncertainty of temper which leaves us
absolutely without grounds for guessing how he will receive our persons
or humbly advanced opinions, or what line he will take on any but the
most momentous occasions.For it is among the repulsive effects of this bad temper, which is
supposed to be compatible with shining virtues, that it is apt to
determine a man's sudden adhesion to an opinion, whether on a personal
or impersonal matter, without leaving him time to consider his grounds.The adhesion is sudden and momentary, but it either forms a precedent
for his line of thought and action, or it is presently seen to have been
inconsistent with his true mind.This determination of partisanship by
temper has its worst effects in the career of the public man, who is
always in danger of getting so enthralled by his own words that he looks
into facts and questions not to get rectifying knowledge, but to get
evidence that will justify his actual attitude which was assumed under
an impulse dependent on something else than knowledge.There has been
plenty of insistance on the evil of swearing by the words of a master,
and having the judgment uniformly controlled by a "He said it;" but a
much worse woe to befall a man is to have every judgment controlled by
an "I said it"--to make a divinity of his own short-sightedness or
passion-led aberration and explain the world in its honour.There is
hardly a more pitiable degradation than this for a man of high gifts.Hence I cannot join with those who wish that Touchwood, being young
enough to enter on public life, should get elected for Parliament and
use his excellent abilities to serve his country in that conspicuous
manner.For hitherto, in the less momentous incidents of private life,
his capricious temper has only produced the minor evil of inconsistency,
and he is even greatly at ease in contradicting himself, provided he can
contradict you, and disappoint any smiling expectation you may have
shown that the impressions you are uttering are likely to meet with his
sympathy, considering that the day before he himself gave you the
example which your mind is following.He is at least free from those
fetters of self-justification which are the curse of parliamentary
speaking, and what I rather desire for him is that he should produce the
great book which he is generally pronounced capable of writing, and put
his best self imperturbably on record for the advantage of society;
because I should then have steady ground for bearing with his diurnal
incalculableness, and could fix my gratitude as by a strong staple to
that unvarying monumental service.Unhappily, Touchwood's great powers
have been only so far manifested as to be believed in, not demonstrated.Everybody rates them highly, and thinks that whatever he chose to do
would be done in a first-rate manner.Is it his love of disappointing
complacent expectancy which has gone so far as to keep up this
lamentable negation, and made him resolve not to write the comprehensive
work which he would have written if nobody had expected it of him?One can see that if Touchwood were to become a public man and take to
frequent speaking on platforms or from his seat in the House, it would
hardly be possible for him to maintain much integrity of opinion, or to
avoid courses of partisanship which a healthy public sentiment would
stamp with discredit.Say that he were endowed with the purest honesty,
it would inevitably be dragged captive by this mysterious, Protean bad
temper.There would be the fatal public necessity of justifying
oratorical Temper which had got on its legs in its bitter mood and made
insulting imputations, or of keeping up some decent show of consistency
with opinions vented out of Temper's contradictoriness.And words would
have to be followed up by acts of adhesion.Certainly if a bad-tempered man can be admirably virtuous, he must be so
under extreme difficulties.I doubt the possibility that a high order of
character can coexist with a temper like Touchwood's.For it is of the
nature of such temper to interrupt the formation of healthy mental
habits, which depend on a growing harmony between perception,
conviction, and impulse.There may be good feelings, good deeds--for a
human nature may pack endless varieties and blessed inconsistencies in
its windings--but it is essential to what is worthy to be called high
character, that it may be safely calculated on, and that its qualities
shall have taken the form of principles or laws habitually, if not
perfectly, obeyed.If a man frequently passes unjust judgments, takes up false attitudes,
intermits his acts of kindness with rude behaviour or cruel words, and
falls into the consequent vulgar error of supposing that he can make
amends by laboured agreeableness, I cannot consider such courses any the
less ugly because they are ascribed to "temper."Especially I object to
the assumption that his having a fundamentally good disposition is
either an apology or a compensation for his bad behaviour.If his temper
yesterday made him lash the horses, upset the curricle and cause a
breakage in my rib, I feel it no compensation that to-day he vows he
will drive me anywhere in the gentlest manner any day as long as he
lives.Yesterday was what it was, my rib is paining me, it is not a main
object of my life to be driven by Touchwood--and I have no confidence in
his lifelong gentleness.The utmost form of placability I am capable of
is to try and remember his better deeds already performed, and, mindful
of my own offences, to bear him no malice.If the bad-tempered man wants to apologise he had need to do it on a
large public scale, make some beneficent discovery, produce some
stimulating work of genius, invent some powerful process--prove himself
such a good to contemporary multitudes and future generations, as to
make the discomfort he causes his friends and acquaintances a vanishing
quality, a trifle even in their own estimate.The most arrant denier must admit that a man often furthers larger ends
than he is conscious of, and that while he is transacting his particular
affairs with the narrow pertinacity of a respectable ant, he subserves
an economy larger than any purpose of his own.Society is happily not
dependent for the growth of fellowship on the small minority already
endowed with comprehensive sympathy: any molecule of the body politic
working towards his own interest in an orderly way gets his
understanding more or less penetrated with the fact that his interest is
included in that of a large number.I have watched several political
molecules being educated in this way by the nature of things into a
faint feeling of fraternity.But at this moment I am thinking of Spike,
an elector who voted on the side of Progress though he was not inwardly
attached to it under that name.For abstractions are deities having many
specific names, local habitations, and forms of activity, and so get a
multitude of devout servants who care no more for them under their
highest titles than the celebrated person who, putting with forcible
brevity a view of human motives now much insisted on, asked what
Posterity had done for him that he should care for Posterity?To many
minds even among the ancients (thought by some to have been invariably
poetical) the goddess of wisdom was doubtless worshipped simply as the
patroness of spinning and weaving.Now spinning and weaving from a
manufacturing, wholesale point of view, was the chief form under which
Spike from early years had unconsciously been a devotee of Progress.He was a political molecule of the most gentleman-like appearance, not
less than six feet high, and showing the utmost nicety in the care of
his person and equipment.His umbrella was especially remarkable for its
neatness, though perhaps he swung it unduly in walking.His complexion
was fresh, his eyes small, bright, and twinkling.He was seen to great
advantage in a hat and greatcoat--garments frequently fatal to the
impressiveness of shorter figures; but when he was uncovered in the
drawing-room, it was impossible not to observe that his head shelved off
too rapidly from the eyebrows towards the crown, and that his length of
limb seemed to have used up his mind so as to cause an air of
abstraction from conversational topics.He appeared, indeed, to be
preoccupied with a sense of his exquisite cleanliness, clapped his hands
together and rubbed them frequently, straightened his back, and even
opened his mouth and closed it again with a slight snap, apparently for
no other purpose than the confirmation to himself of his own powers in
that line.These are innocent exercises, but they are not such as give
weight to a man's personality.Sometimes Spike's mind, emerging from its
preoccupation, burst forth in a remark delivered with smiling zest; as,
that he did like to see gravel walks well rolled, or that a lady should
always wear the best jewellery, or that a bride was a most interesting
object; but finding these ideas received rather coldly, he would relapse
into abstraction, draw up his back, wrinkle his brows longitudinally,
and seem to regard society, even including gravel walks, jewellery, and
brides, as essentially a poor affair.Indeed his habit of mind was
desponding, and he took melancholy views as to the possible extent of
human pleasure and the value of existence.Especially after he had made
his fortune in the cotton manufacture, and had thus attained the chief
object of his ambition--the object which had engaged his talent for
order and persevering application.For his easy leisure caused him much
_ennui_.He was abstemious, and had none of those temptations to sensual
excess which fill up a man's time first with indulgence and then with
the process of getting well from its effects.He had not, indeed,
exhausted the sources of knowledge, but here again his notions of human
pleasure were narrowed by his want of appetite; for though he seemed
rather surprised at the consideration that Alfred the Great was a
Catholic, or that apart from the Ten Commandments any conception of
moral conduct had occurred to mankind, he was not stimulated to further
inquiries on these remote matters.Yet he aspired to what he regarded as
intellectual society, willingly entertained beneficed clergymen, and
bought the books he heard spoken of, arranging them carefully on the
shelves of what he called his library, and occasionally sitting alone in
the same room with them.But some minds seem well glazed by nature
against the admission of knowledge, and Spike's was one of them.It was
not, however, entirely so with regard to politics.He had had a strong
opinion about the Reform Bill, and saw clearly that the large trading
towns ought to send members.Portraits of the Reform heroes hung framed
and glazed in his library: he prided himself on being a Liberal.In this
last particular, as well as in not giving benefactions and not making
loans without interest, he showed unquestionable firmness.On the Repeal
of the Corn Laws, again, he was thoroughly convinced.His mind was
expansive towards foreign markets, and his imagination could see that
the people from whom we took corn might be able to take the cotton goods
which they had hitherto dispensed with.On his conduct in these
political concerns, his wife, otherwise influential as a woman who
belonged to a family with a title in it, and who had condescended in
marrying him, could gain no hold: she had to blush a little at what was
called her husband's "radicalism"--an epithet which was a very unfair
impeachment of Spike, who never went to the root of anything.But he
understood his own trading affairs, and in this way became a genuine,
constant political element.If he had been born a little later he could
have been accepted as an eligible member of Parliament, and if he had
belonged to a high family he might have done for a member of the
Government.Perhaps his indifference to "views" would have passed for
administrative judiciousness, and he would have been so generally silent
that he must often have been silent in the right place.But this is
empty speculation: there is no warrant for saying what Spike would have
been and known so as to have made a calculable political element, if he
had not been educated by having to manage his trade.A small mind
trained to useful occupation for the satisfying of private need becomes
a representative of genuine class-needs.Spike objected to certain items
of legislation because they hampered his own trade, but his neighbours'
trade was hampered by the same causes; and though he would have been
simply selfish in a question of light or water between himself and a
fellow-townsman, his need for a change in legislation, being shared by
all his neighbours in trade, ceased to be simply selfish, and raised him
to a sense of common injury and common benefit.True, if the law could
have been changed for the benefit of his particular business, leaving
the cotton trade in general in a sorry condition while he prospered,
Spike might not have thought that result intolerably unjust; but the
nature of things did not allow of such a result being contemplated as
possible; it allowed of an enlarged market for Spike only through the
enlargement of his neighbours' market, and the Possible is always the
ultimate master of our efforts and desires.Spike was obliged to
contemplate a general benefit, and thus became public-spirited in spite
of himself.Or rather, the nature of things transmuted his active egoism
into a demand for a public benefit.Certainly if Spike had been born a
marquis he could not have had the same chance of being useful as a
political element.But he might have had the same appearance, have been
equally null in conversation, sceptical as to the reality of pleasure,
and destitute of historical knowledge; perhaps even dimly disliking
Jesuitism as a quality in Catholic minds, or regarding Bacon as the
inventor of physical science.The depths of middle-aged gentlemen's
ignorance will never be known, for want of public examinations in this
branch.THE WATCH-DOG OF KNOWLEDGE

Mordax is an admirable man, ardent in intellectual work,
public-spirited, affectionate, and able to find the right words in
conveying ingenious ideas or elevated feeling.Pity that to all these
graces he cannot add what would give them the utmost finish--the
occasional admission that he has been in the wrong, the occasional frank
welcome of a new idea as something not before present to his mind!But
no: Mordax's self-respect seems to be of that fiery quality which
demands that none but the monarchs of thought shall have an advantage
over him, and in the presence of contradiction or the threat of having
his notions corrected, he becomes astonishingly unscrupulous and cruel
for so kindly and conscientious a man."You are fond of attributing those fine qualities to Mordax," said
Acer, the other day, "but I have not much belief in virtues that are
always requiring to be asserted in spite of appearances against them.True fairness and goodwill show themselves precisely where his are
conspicuously absent.I mean, in recognising claims which the rest of
the world are not likely to stand up for.It does not need much love of
truth and justice in me to say that Aldebaran is a bright star, or Isaac
Newton the greatest of discoverers; nor much kindliness in me to want my
notes to be heard above the rest in a chorus of hallelujahs to one
already crowned.Does the man who has the
ear of the public use his advantage tenderly towards poor fellows who
may be hindered of their due if he treats their pretensions with scorn?That is my test of his justice and benevolence."My answer was, that his system of moral tests might be as delusive as
what ignorant people take to be tests of intellect and learning.If the
scholar or _savant_ cannot answer their haphazard questions on the
shortest notice, their belief in his capacity is shaken.But the
better-informed have given up the Johnsonian theory of mind as a pair of
legs able to walk east or west according to choice.Intellect is no
longer taken to be a ready-made dose of ability to attain eminence (or
mediocrity) in all departments; it is even admitted that application in
one line of study or practice has often a laming effect in other
directions, and that an intellectual quality or special facility which
is a furtherance in one medium of effort is a drag in another.We have
convinced ourselves by this time that a man may be a sage in celestial
physics and a poor creature in the purchase of seed-corn, or even in
theorising about the affections; that he may be a mere fumbler in
physiology and yet show a keen insight into human motives; that he may
seem the "poor Poll" of the company in conversation and yet write with
some humorous vigour.It is not true that a man's intellectual power is
like the strength of a timber beam, to be measured by its weakest point.Why should we any more apply that fallacious standard of what is called
consistency to a man's moral nature, and argue against the existence of
fine impulses or habits of feeling in relation to his actions
generally, because those better movements are absent in a class of cases
which act peculiarly on an irritable form of his egoism?The mistake
might be corrected by our taking notice that the ungenerous words or
acts which seem to us the most utterly incompatible with good
dispositions in the offender, are those which offend ourselves.All
other persons are able to draw a milder conclusion.Laniger, who has a
temper but no talent for repartee, having been run down in a fierce way
by Mordax, is inwardly persuaded that the highly-lauded man is a wolf at
heart: he is much tried by perceiving that his own friends seem to think
no worse of the reckless assailant than they did before; and Corvus, who
has lately been flattered by some kindness from Mordax, is unmindful
enough of Laniger's feeling to dwell on this instance of good-nature
with admiring gratitude.There is a fable that when the badger had been
stung all over by bees, a bear consoled him by a rhapsodic account of
how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey.The badger replied,
peevishly, "The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your
muzzle."The bear, it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of
altruism.But this difference of sensibility between Laniger and his friends only
mirrors in a faint way the difference between his own point of view and
that of the man who has injured him.If those neutral, perhaps even
affectionate persons, form no lively conception of what Laniger suffers,
how should Mordax have any such sympathetic imagination to check him in
what he persuades himself is a scourging administered by the qualified
man to the unqualified?Depend upon it, his conscience, though active
enough in some relations, has never given him a twinge because of his
polemical rudeness and even brutality.He would go from the room where
he has been tiring himself through the watches of the night in lifting
and turning a sick friend, and straightway write a reply or rejoinder in
which he mercilessly pilloried a Laniger who had supposed that he could
tell the world something else or more than had been sanctioned by the
eminent Mordax--and what was worse, had sometimes really done so.Does
this nullify the genuineness of motive which made him tender to his
suffering friend?It only proves that his arrogant egoism,
set on fire, sends up smoke and flame where just before there had been
the dews of fellowship and pity.He is angry and equips himself
accordingly--with a penknife to give the offender a _comprachico_
countenance, a mirror to show him the effect, and a pair of nailed boots
to give him his dismissal.All this to teach him who the Romans really
were, and to purge Inquiry of incompetent intrusion, so rendering an
important service to mankind.When a man is in a rage and wants to hurt another in consequence, he can
always regard himself as the civil arm of a spiritual power, and all the
more easily because there is real need to assert the righteous efficacy
of indignation.I for my part feel with the Lanigers, and should object
all the more to their or my being lacerated and dressed with salt, if
the administrator of such torture alleged as a motive his care for Truth
and posterity, and got himself pictured with a halo in consequence.In
transactions between fellow-men it is well to consider a little, in the
first place, what is fair and kind towards the person immediately
concerned, before we spit and roast him on behalf of the next century
but one.Wide-reaching motives, blessed and glorious as they are, and of
the highest sacramental virtue, have their dangers, like all else that
touches the mixed life of the earth.They are archangels with awful brow
and flaming sword, summoning and encouraging us to do the right and the
divinely heroic, and we feel a beneficent tremor in their presence; but
to learn what it is they thus summon us to do, we have to consider the
mortals we are elbowing, who are of our own stature and our own
appetites.I cannot feel sure how my voting will affect the condition of
Central Asia in the coming ages, but I have good reason to believe that
the future populations there will be none the worse off because I
abstain from conjectural vilification of my opponents during the present
parliamentary session, and I am very sure that I shall be less injurious
to my contemporaries.On the whole, and in the vast majority of
instances, the action by which we can do the best for future ages is of
the sort which has a certain beneficence and grace for contemporaries.A
sour father may reform prisons, but considered in his sourness he does
harm.The deed of Judas has been attributed to far-reaching views, and
the wish to hasten his Master's declaration of himself as the Messiah.Perhaps--I will not maintain the contrary--Judas represented his motive
in this way, and felt justified in his traitorous kiss; but my belief
that he deserved, metaphorically speaking, to be where Dante saw him, at
the bottom of the Malebolge, would not be the less strong because he was
not convinced that his action was detestable.I refuse to accept a man
who has the stomach for such treachery, as a hero impatient for the
redemption of mankind and for the beginning of a reign when the kisses
shall be those of peace and righteousness.All this is by the way, to show that my apology for Mordax was not
founded on his persuasion of superiority in his own motives, but on the
compatibility of unfair, equivocal, and even cruel actions with a nature
which, apart from special temptations, is kindly and generous; and also
to enforce the need of checks from a fellow-feeling with those whom our
acts immediately (not distantly) concern.Will any one be so hardy as to
maintain that an otherwise worthy man cannot be vain and arrogant?I
think most of us have some interest in arguing the contrary.And it is
of the nature of vanity and arrogance, if unchecked, to become cruel and
self-justifying.There are fierce beasts within: chain them, chain them,
and let them learn to cower before the creature with wider reason.This
is what one wishes for Mordax--that his heart and brain should restrain
the outleap of roar and talons.As to his unwillingness to admit that an idea which he has not
discovered is novel to him, one is surprised that quick intellect and
shrewd observation do not early gather reasons for being ashamed of a
mental trick which makes one among the comic parts of that various actor
Conceited Ignorance.I have a sort of valet and factotum, an excellent, respectable servant,
whose spelling is so unvitiated by non-phonetic superfluities that he
writes _night_ as _nit_.One day, looking over his accounts, I said to
him jocosely, "You are in the latest fashion with your spelling, Pummel:
most people spell "night" with a _gh_ between the _i_ and the _t_, but
the greatest scholars now spell it as you do.""So I suppose, sir,"
says Pummel; "I've see it with a _gh_, but I've noways give into that
myself."You would never catch Pummel in an interjection of surprise.I
have sometimes laid traps for his astonishment, but he has escaped them
all, either by a respectful neutrality, as of one who would not appear
to notice that his master had been taking too much wine, or else by that
strong persuasion of his all-knowingness which makes it simply
impossible for him to feel himself newly informed.If I tell him that
the world is spinning round and along like a top, and that he is
spinning with it, he says, "Yes, I've heard a deal of that in my time,
sir," and lifts the horizontal lines of his brow a little higher,
balancing his head from side to side as if it were too painfully full.Whether I tell him that they cook puppies in China, that there are ducks
with fur coats in Australia, or that in some parts of the world it is
the pink of politeness to put your tongue out on introduction to a
respectable stranger, Pummel replies, "So I suppose, sir," with an air
of resignation to hearing my poor version of well-known things, such as
elders use in listening to lively boys lately presented with an
anecdote book.His utmost concession is, that what you state is what he
would have supplied if you had given him _carte blanche_ instead of your
needless instruction, and in this sense his favourite answer is, "I
should say.""Pummel," I observed, a little irritated at not getting my coffee, "if
you were to carry your kettle and spirits of wine up a mountain of a
morning, your water would boil there sooner.""Or,
there are boiling springs in Iceland."That's
what I've been thinking, sir."I have taken to asking him hard questions, and as I expected, he never
admits his own inability to answer them without representing it as
common to the human race."What is the cause of the tides, Pummel?"Many gives their opinion, but if I
was to give mine, it 'ud be different."But while he is never surprised himself, he is constantly imagining
situations of surprise for others.His own consciousness is that of one
so thoroughly soaked in knowledge that further absorption is
impossible, but his neighbours appear to him to be in the state of
thirsty sponges which it is a charity to besprinkle.His great
interest in thinking of foreigners is that they must be surprised at
what they see in England, and especially at the beef.He is often
occupied with the surprise Adam must have felt at the sight of the
assembled animals--"for he was not like us, sir, used from a b'y to
Wombwell's shows."He is fond of discoursing to the lad who acts as
shoe-black and general subaltern, and I have overheard him saying to
that small upstart, with some severity, "Now don't you pretend to know,
because the more you pretend the more I see your ignirance"--a lucidity
on his part which has confirmed my impression that the thoroughly
self-satisfied person is the only one fully to appreciate the charm of
humility in others.Your diffident self-suspecting mortal is not very angry that others
should feel more comfortable about themselves, provided they are not
otherwise offensive: he is rather like the chilly person, glad to sit
next a warmer neighbour; or the timid, glad to have a courageous
fellow-traveller.It cheers him to observe the store of small comforts
that his fellow-creatures may find in their self-complacency, just as
one is pleased to see poor old souls soothed by the tobacco and snuff
for which one has neither nose nor stomach oneself.But your arrogant man will not tolerate a presumption which he sees to
be ill-founded.The service he regards society as most in need of is to
put down the conceit which is so particularly rife around him that he is
inclined to believe it the growing characteristic of the present age.In
the schools of Magna Graecia, or in the sixth century of our era, or
even under Kublai Khan, he finds a comparative freedom from that
presumption by which his contemporaries are stirring his able gall.The
way people will now flaunt notions which are not his without appearing
to mind that they are not his, strikes him as especially disgusting.It
might seem surprising to us that one strongly convinced of his own value
should prefer to exalt an age in which _he_ did not flourish, if it were
not for the reflection that the present age is the only one in which
anybody has appeared to undervalue him.A HALF-BREED

An early deep-seated love to which we become faithless has its unfailing
Nemesis, if only in that division of soul which narrows all newer joys
by the intrusion of regret and the established presentiment of change.I
refer not merely to the love of a person, but to the love of ideas,
practical beliefs, and social habits.And faithlessness here means not a
gradual conversion dependent on enlarged knowledge, but a yielding to
seductive circumstance; not a conviction that the original choice was a
mistake, but a subjection to incidents that flatter a growing desire.In
this sort of love it is the forsaker who has the melancholy lot; for an
abandoned belief may be more effectively vengeful than Dido.The child
of a wandering tribe caught young and trained to polite life, if he
feels an hereditary yearning can run away to the old wilds and get his
nature into tune.But there is no such recovery possible to the man who
remembers what he once believed without being convinced that he was in
error, who feels within him unsatisfied stirrings towards old beloved
habits and intimacies from which he has far receded without conscious
justification or unwavering sense of superior attractiveness in the new.This involuntary renegade has his character hopelessly jangled and out
of tune.He is like an organ with its stops in the lawless condition of
obtruding themselves without method, so that hearers are amazed by the
most unexpected transitions--the trumpet breaking in on the flute, and
the oboee confounding both.Hence the lot of Mixtus affects me pathetically, notwithstanding that he
spends his growing wealth with liberality and manifest enjoyment.To
most observers he appears to be simply one of the fortunate and also
sharp commercial men who began with meaning to be rich and have become
what they meant to be: a man never taken to be well-born, but
surprisingly better informed than the well-born usually are, and
distinguished among ordinary commercial magnates by a personal kindness
which prompts him not only to help the suffering in a material way
through his wealth, but also by direct ministration of his own; yet with
all this, diffusing, as it were, the odour of a man delightedly
conscious of his wealth as an equivalent for the other social
distinctions of rank and intellect which he can thus admire without
envying.Hardly one among those superficial observers can suspect that
he aims or has ever aimed at being a writer; still less can they imagine
that his mind is often moved by strong currents of regret and of the
most unworldly sympathies from the memories of a youthful time when his
chosen associates were men and women whose only distinction was a
religious, a philanthropic, or an intellectual enthusiasm, when the lady
on whose words his attention most hung was a writer of minor religious
literature, when he was a visitor and exhorter of the poor in the alleys
of a great provincial town, and when he attended the lectures given
specially to young men by Mr Apollos, the eloquent congregational
preacher, who had studied in Germany and had liberal advanced views then
far beyond the ordinary teaching of his sect.At that time Mixtus
thought himself a young man of socially reforming ideas, of religious
principles and religious yearnings.It was within his prospects also to
be rich, but he looked forward to a use of his riches chiefly for
reforming and religious purposes.His opinions were of a strongly
democratic stamp, except that even then, belonging to the class of
employers, he was opposed to all demands in the employed that would
restrict the expansiveness of trade.He was the most democratic in
relation to the unreasonable privileges of the aristocracy and landed
interest; and he had also a religious sense of brotherhood with the
poor.Altogether, he was a sincerely benevolent young man, interested in
ideas, and renouncing personal ease for the sake of study, religious
communion, and good works.If you had known him then you would have
expected him to marry a highly serious and perhaps literary woman,
sharing his benevolent and religious habits, and likely to encourage
his studies--a woman who along with himself would play a distinguished
part in one of the most enlightened religious circles of a great
provincial capital.How is it that Mixtus finds himself in a London mansion, and in society
totally unlike that which made the ideal of his younger years?Why, he married Scintilla, who fascinated him as she had fascinated
others, by her prettiness, her liveliness, and her music.It is a common
enough case, that of a man being suddenly captivated by a woman nearly
the opposite of his ideal; or if not wholly captivated, at least
effectively captured by a combination of circumstances along with an
unwarily manifested inclination which might otherwise have been
transient.Mixtus was captivated and then captured on the worldly side
of his disposition, which had been always growing and flourishing side
by side with his philanthropic and religious tastes.He had ability in
business, and he had early meant to be rich; also, he was getting rich,
and the taste for such success was naturally growing with the pleasure
of rewarded exertion.It was during a business sojourn in London that he
met Scintilla, who, though without fortune, associated with families of
Greek merchants living in a style of splendour, and with artists
patronised by such wealthy entertainers.Mixtus on this occasion became
familiar with a world in which wealth seemed the key to a more brilliant
sort of dominance than that of a religious patron in the provincial
circles of X. Would it not be possible to unite the two kinds of sway?A
man bent on the most useful ends might, _with a fortune large enough_,
make morality magnificent, and recommend religious principle by showing
it in combination with the best kind of house and the most liberal of
tables; also with a wife whose graces, wit, and accomplishments gave a
finish sometimes lacking even to establishments got up with that
unhesitating worldliness to which high cost is a sufficient reason.Now this lively lady knew nothing of
Nonconformists, except that they were unfashionable: she did not
distinguish one conventicle from another, and Mr Apollos with his
enlightened interpretations seemed to her as heavy a bore, if not quite
so ridiculous, as Mr Johns could have been with his solemn twang at the
Baptist chapel in the lowest suburbs, or as a local preacher among the
Methodists.In general, people who appeared seriously to believe in any
sort of doctrine, whether religious, social, or philosophical, seemed
rather absurd to Scintilla.Ten to one these theoretic people pronounced
oddly, had some reason or other for saying that the most agreeable
things were wrong, wore objectionable clothes, and wanted you to
subscribe to something.They were probably ignorant of art and music,
did not understand _badinage_, and, in fact, could talk of nothing
amusing.In Scintilla's eyes the majority of persons were ridiculous and
deplorably wanting in that keen perception of what was good taste, with
which she herself was blest by nature and education; but the people
understood to be religious or otherwise theoretic, were the most
ridiculous of all, without being proportionately amusing and invitable.Did Mixtus not discover this view of Scintilla's before their marriage?Or did he allow her to remain in ignorance of habits and opinions which
had made half the occupation of his youth?When a man is inclined to marry a particular woman, and has made any
committal of himself, this woman's opinions, however different from his
own, are readily regarded as part of her pretty ways, especially if they
are merely negative; as, for example, that she does not insist on the
Trinity or on the rightfulness or expediency of church rates, but simply
regards her lover's troubling himself in disputation on these heads as
stuff and nonsense.The man feels his own superior strength, and is sure
that marriage will make no difference to him on the subjects about which
he is in earnest.And to laugh at men's affairs is a woman's privilege,
tending to enliven the domestic hearth.If Scintilla had no liking for
the best sort of nonconformity, she was without any troublesome bias
towards Episcopacy, Anglicanism, and early sacraments, and was quite
contented not to go to church.As to Scintilla's acquaintance with her lover's tastes on these
subjects, she was equally convinced on her side that a husband's queer
ways while he was a bachelor would be easily laughed out of him when he
had married an adroit woman.Mixtus, she felt, was an excellent
creature, quite likable, who was getting rich; and Scintilla meant to
have all the advantages of a rich man's wife.She was not in the least a
wicked woman; she was simply a pretty animal of the ape kind, with an
aptitude for certain accomplishments which education had made the most
of.But we have seen what has been the result to poor Mixtus.He has become
richer even than he dreamed of being, has a little palace in London, and
entertains with splendour the half-aristocratic, professional, and
artistic society which he is proud to think select.This society regards
him as a clever fellow in his particular branch, seeing that he has
become a considerable capitalist, and as a man desirable to have on the
list of one's acquaintance.But from every other point of view Mixtus
finds himself personally submerged: what he happens to think is not felt
by his esteemed guests to be of any consequence, and what he used to
think with the ardour of conviction he now hardly ever expresses.He is
transplanted, and the sap within him has long been diverted into other
than the old lines of vigorous growth.How could he speak to the artist
Crespi or to Sir Hong Kong Bantam about the enlarged doctrine of Mr
Apollos?How could he mention to them his former efforts towards
evangelising the inhabitants of the X. alleys?And his references to his
historical and geographical studies towards a survey of possible markets
for English products are received with an air of ironical suspicion by
many of his political friends, who take his pretension to give advice
concerning the Amazon, the Euphrates, and the Niger as equivalent to the
currier's wide views on the applicability of leather.He can only make a
figure through his genial hospitality.It is in vain that he buys the
best pictures and statues of the best artists.Nobody will call him a
judge in art.If his pictures and statues are well chosen it is
generally thought that Scintilla told him what to buy; and yet Scintilla
in other connections is spoken of as having only a superficial and
often questionable taste.Mixtus, it is decided, is a good fellow, not
ignorant--no, really having a good deal of knowledge as well as sense,
but not easy to classify otherwise than as a rich man.He has
consequently become a little uncertain as to his own point of view, and
in his most unreserved moments of friendly intercourse, even when
speaking to listeners whom he thinks likely to sympathise with the
earlier part of his career, he presents himself in all his various
aspects and feels himself in turn what he has been, what he is, and what
others take him to be (for this last status is what we must all more or
less accept).He will recover with some glow of enthusiasm the vision of
his old associates, the particular limit he was once accustomed to trace
of freedom in religious speculation, and his old ideal of a worthy life;
but he will presently pass to the argument that money is the only means
by which you can get what is best worth having in the world, and will
arrive at the exclamation "Give me money!"with the tone and gesture of
a man who both feels and knows.Then if one of his audience, not having
money, remarks that a man may have made up his mind to do without money
because he prefers something else, Mixtus is with him immediately,
cordially concurring in the supreme value of mind and genius, which
indeed make his own chief delight, in that he is able to entertain the
admirable possessors of these attributes at his own table, though not
himself reckoned among them.Yet, he will proceed to observe, there was
a time when he sacrificed his sleep to study, and even now amid the
press of business he from time to time thinks of taking up the
manuscripts which he hopes some day to complete, and is always
increasing his collection of valuable works bearing on his favourite
topics.And it is true that he has read much in certain directions, and
can remember what he has read; he knows the history and theories of
colonisation and the social condition of countries that do not at
present consume a sufficiently large share of our products and
manufactures.He continues his early habit of regarding the spread of
Christianity as a great result of our commercial intercourse with black,
brown, and yellow populations; but this is an idea not spoken of in the
sort of fashionable society that Scintilla collects round her husband's
table, and Mixtus now philosophically reflects that the cause must come
before the effect, and that the thing to be directly striven for is the
commercial intercourse, not excluding a little war if that also should
prove needful as a pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to
feel bashful about his former religion; as if it were an old attachment
having consequences which he did not abandon but kept in decent privacy,
his avowed objects and actual position being incompatible with their
public acknowledgment.There is the same kind of fluctuation in his aspect towards social
questions and duties.He has not lost the kindness that used to make him
a benefactor and succourer of the needy, and he is still liberal in
helping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active
superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who this
is an idea not spoken of in the sort of fashionable society that
Scintilla collects round her husband's table, and Mixtus now
philosophically reflects that the cause must come before the effect, and
that the thing to be directly striven for is the commercial intercourse,
not excluding a little war if that also should prove needful as a
pioneer of Christianity.He has long been wont to feel bashful about his

helping forward the clever and industrious; but in his active
superintendence of commercial undertakings he has contracted more and
more of the bitterness which capitalists and employers often feel to be
a reasonable mood towards obstructive proletaries.Hence many who have
occasionally met him when trade questions were being discussed, conclude
him to be indistinguishable from the ordinary run of moneyed and
money-getting men.Indeed, hardly any of his acquaintances know what
Mixtus really is, considered as a whole--nor does Mixtus himself know
it.X.


DEBASING THE MORAL CURRENCY."Il ne faut pas mettre un ridicule ou il n'y en a point: c'est se gater
le gout, c'est corrompre son jugement et celui des autres.Mais le
ridicule qui est quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace
et d'une maniere qui plaise et qui instruise."I am fond of quoting this passage from La Bruyere, because the subject
is one where I like to show a Frenchman on my side, to save my
sentiments from being set down to my peculiar dulness and deficient
sense of the ludicrous, and also that they may profit by that
enhancement of ideas when presented in a foreign tongue, that glamour of
unfamiliarity conferring a dignity on the foreign names of very common
things, of which even a philosopher like Dugald Stewart confesses the
influence.I remember hearing a fervid woman attempt to recite in
English the narrative of a begging Frenchman who described the violent
death of his father in the July days.The narrative had impressed her,
through the mists of her flushed anxiety to understand it, as something
quite grandly pathetic; but finding the facts turn out meagre, and her
audience cold, she broke off, saying, "It sounded so much finer in
French--_j'ai vu le sang de mon pere_, and so on--I wish I could repeat
it in French."This was a pardonable illusion in an old-fashioned lady
who had not received the polyglot education of the present day; but I
observe that even now much nonsense and bad taste win admiring
acceptance solely by virtue of the French language, and one may fairly
desire that what seems a just discrimination should profit by the
fashionable prejudice in favour of La Bruyere's idiom.But I wish he had
added that the habit of dragging the ludicrous into topics where the
chief interest is of a different or even opposite kind is a sign not of
endowment, but of deficiency.The art of spoiling is within reach of the
dullest faculty: the coarsest clown with a hammer in his hand might
chip the nose off every statue and bust in the Vatican, and stand
grinning at the effect of his work.Because wit is an exquisite product
of high powers, we are not therefore forced to admit the sadly confused
inference of the monotonous jester that he is establishing his
superiority over every less facetious person, and over every topic on
which he is ignorant or insensible, by being uneasy until he has
distorted it in the small cracked mirror which he carries about with him
as a joking apparatus.Some high authority is needed to give many worthy
and timid persons the freedom of muscular repose under the growing
demand on them to laugh when they have no other reason than the peril of
being taken for dullards; still more to inspire them with the courage to
say that they object to the theatrical spoiling for themselves and their
children of all affecting themes, all the grander deeds and aims of men,
by burlesque associations adapted to the taste of rich fishmongers in
the stalls and their assistants in the gallery.The English people in
the present generation are falsely reputed to know Shakspere (as, by
some innocent persons, the Florentine mule-drivers are believed to have
known the _Divina Commedia_, not, perhaps, excluding all the subtle
discourses in the _Purgatorio_ and _Paradiso_); but there seems a clear
prospect that in the coming generation he will be known to them through
burlesques, and that his plays will find a new life as pantomimes.A
bottle-nosed Lear will come on with a monstrous corpulence from which he
will frantically dance himself free during the midnight storm; Rosalind
and Celia will join in a grotesque ballet with shepherds and
shepherdesses; Ophelia in fleshings and a voluminous brevity of
grenadine will dance through the mad scene, finishing with the famous
"attitude of the scissors" in the arms of Laertes; and all the speeches
in "Hamlet" will be so ingeniously parodied that the originals will be
reduced to a mere _memoria technica_ of the improver's puns--premonitory
signs of a hideous millennium, in which the lion will have to lie down
with the lascivious monkeys whom (if we may trust Pliny) his soul
naturally abhors.I have been amazed to find that some artists whose own works have the
ideal stamp, are quite insensible to the damaging tendency of the
burlesquing spirit which ranges to and fro and up and down on the earth,
seeing no reason (except a precarious censorship) why it should not
appropriate every sacred, heroic, and pathetic theme which serves to
make up the treasure of human admiration, hope, and love.One would have
thought that their own half-despairing efforts to invest in worthy
outward shape the vague inward impressions of sublimity, and the
consciousness of an implicit ideal in the commonest scenes, might have
made them susceptible of some disgust or alarm at a species of burlesque
which is likely to render their compositions no better than a dissolving
view, where every noble form is seen melting into its preposterous
caricature.It used to be imagined of the unhappy medieval Jews that
they parodied Calvary by crucifying dogs; if they had been guilty they
would at least have had the excuse of the hatred and rage begotten by
persecution.Are we on the way to a parody which shall have no other
excuse than the reckless search after fodder for degraded
appetites--after the pay to be earned by pasturing Circe's herd where
they may defile every monument of that growing life which should have
kept them human?The world seems to me well supplied with what is genuinely ridiculous:
wit and humour may play as harmlessly or beneficently round the changing
facets of egoism, absurdity, and vice, as the sunshine over the rippling
sea or the dewy meadows.Why should we make our delicious sense of the
ludicrous, with its invigorating shocks of laughter and its
irrepressible smiles which are the outglow of an inward radiation as
gentle and cheering as the warmth of morning, flourish like a brigand on
the robbery of our mental wealth?--or let it take its exercise as a
madman might, if allowed a free nightly promenade, by drawing the
populace with bonfires which leave some venerable structure a blackened
ruin or send a scorching smoke across the portraits of the past, at
which we once looked with a loving recognition of fellowship, and
disfigure them into butts of mockery?--nay, worse--use it to degrade the
healthy appetites and affections of our nature as they are seen to be
degraded in insane patients whose system, all out of joint, finds
matter for screaming laughter in mere topsy-turvy, makes every passion
preposterous or obscene, and turns the hard-won order of life into a
second chaos hideous enough to make one wail that the first was ever
thrilled with light?This is what I call debasing the moral currency: lowering the value of
every inspiring fact and tradition so that it will command less and less
of the spiritual products, the generous motives which sustain the charm
and elevation of our social existence--the something besides bread by
which man saves his soul alive.The bread-winner of the family may
demand more and more coppery shillings, or assignats, or greenbacks for
his day's work, and so get the needful quantum of food; but let that
moral currency be emptied of its value--let a greedy buffoonery debase
all historic beauty, majesty, and pathos, and the more you heap up the
desecrated symbols the greater will be the lack of the ennobling
emotions which subdue the tyranny of suffering, and make ambition one
with social virtue.And yet, it seems, parents will put into the hands of their children
ridiculous parodies (perhaps with more ridiculous "illustrations") of
the poems which stirred their own tenderness or filial piety, and carry
them to make their first acquaintance with great men, great works, or
solemn crises through the medium of some miscellaneous burlesque which,
with its idiotic puns and farcical attitudes, will remain among their
primary associations, and reduce them throughout their time of studious
preparation for life to the moral imbecility of an inward giggle at what
might have stimulated their high emulation or fed the fountains of
compassion, trust, and constancy.One wonders where these parents have
deposited that stock of morally educating stimuli which is to be
independent of poetic tradition, and to subsist in spite of the finest
images being degraded and the finest words of genius being poisoned as
with some befooling drug.Will fine wit, will exquisite humour prosper the more through this
turning of all things indiscriminately into food for a gluttonous
laughter, an idle craving without sense of flavours?That delightful power which La Bruyere points to--"le ridicule qui est
quelque part, il faut l'y voir, l'en tirer avec grace et d'une maniere
qui plaise et qui instruise"--depends on a discrimination only
compatible with the varied sensibilities which give sympathetic insight,
and with the justice of perception which is another name for grave
knowledge.Such a result is no more to be expected from faculties on the
strain to find some small hook by which they may attach the lowest
incongruity to the most momentous subject, than it is to be expected of
a sharper, watching for gulls in a great political assemblage, that he
will notice the blundering logic of partisan speakers, or season his
observation with the salt of historical parallels.But after all our
psychological teaching, and in the midst of our zeal for education, we
are still, most of us, at the stage of believing that mental powers and
habits have somehow, not perhaps in the general statement, but in any
particular case, a kind of spiritual glaze against conditions which we
are continually applying to them.We soak our children in habits of
contempt and exultant gibing, and yet are confident that--as Clarissa
one day said to me--"We can always teach them to be reverent in the
right place, you know."And doubtless if she were to take her boys to
see a burlesque Socrates, with swollen legs, dying in the utterance of
cockney puns, and were to hang up a sketch of this comic scene among
their bedroom prints, she would think this preparation not at all to the
prejudice of their emotions on hearing their tutor read that narrative
of the _Apology_ which has been consecrated by the reverent gratitude of
ages.This is the impoverishment that threatens our posterity:--a new
Famine, a meagre fiend with lewd grin and clumsy hoof, is breathing a
moral mildew over the harvest of our human sentiments.These are the
most delicate elements of our too easily perishable civilisation.And
here again I like to quote a French testimony.Sainte Beuve, referring
to a time of insurrectionary disturbance, says: "Rien de plus prompt a
baisser que la civilisation dans des crises comme celle-ci; on perd en
trois semaines le resultat de plusieurs siecles.La civilisation, la
_vie_ est une chose apprise et inventee, qu'on le sache bien: '_Inventas
aut qui vitam excoluere per artes_.'Les hommes apres quelques annees de
paix oublient trop cette verite: ils arrivent a croire que la _culture_
est chose innee, qu'elle est la meme chose que la _nature_.La
sauvagerie est toujours la a deux pas, et, des qu'on lache pied, elle
recommence."We have been severely enough taught (if we were willing to
learn) that our civilisation, considered as a splendid material fabric,
is helplessly in peril without the spiritual police of sentiments or
ideal feelings.And it is this invisible police which we had need, as a
community, strive to maintain in efficient force.How if a dangerous
"Swing" were sometimes disguised in a versatile entertainer devoted to
the amusement of mixed audiences?And I confess that sometimes when I
see a certain style of young lady, who checks our tender admiration with
rouge and henna and all the blazonry of an extravagant expenditure, with
slang and bold _brusquerie_ intended to signify her emancipated view of
things, and with cynical mockery which she mistakes for penetration, I
am sorely tempted to hiss out "_Petroleuse!_" It is a small matter to
have our palaces set aflame compared with the misery of having our sense
of a noble womanhood, which is the inspiration of a purifying shame, the
promise of life--penetrating affection, stained and blotted out by
images of repulsiveness.These things come--not of higher education,
but--of dull ignorance fostered into pertness by the greedy vulgarity
which reverses Peter's visionary lesson and learns to call all things
common and unclean.The Tirynthians, according to an ancient story reported by Athenaeus,
becoming conscious that their trick of laughter at everything and
nothing was making them unfit for the conduct of serious affairs,
appealed to the Delphic oracle for some means of cure.The god
prescribed a peculiar form of sacrifice, which would be effective if
they could carry it through without laughing.They did their best; but
the flimsy joke of a boy upset their unaccustomed gravity, and in this
way the oracle taught them that even the gods could not prescribe a
quick cure for a long vitiation, or give power and dignity to a people
who in a crisis of the public wellbeing were at the mercy of a poor
jest.THE WASP CREDITED WITH THE HONEYCOMB

No man, I imagine, would object more strongly than Euphorion to
communistic principles in relation to material property, but with regard
to property in ideas he entertains such principles willingly, and is
disposed to treat the distinction between Mine and Thine in original
authorship as egoistic, narrowing, and low.I have known him, indeed,
insist at some expense of erudition on the prior right of an ancient, a
medieval, or an eighteenth century writer to be credited with a view or
statement lately advanced with some show of originality; and this
championship seems to imply a nicety of conscience towards the dead.He
is evidently unwilling that his neighbours should get more credit than
is due to them, and in this way he appears to recognise a certain
proprietorship even in spiritual production.But perhaps it is no real
inconsistency that, with regard to many instances of modern origination,
it is his habit to talk with a Gallic largeness and refer to the
universe: he expatiates on the diffusive nature of intellectual
products, free and all-embracing as the liberal air; on the
infinitesimal smallness of individual origination compared with the
massive inheritance of thought on which every new generation enters; on
that growing preparation for every epoch through which certain ideas or
modes of view are said to be in the air, and, still more metaphorically
speaking, to be inevitably absorbed, so that every one may be excused
for not knowing how he got them.Above all, he insists on the proper
subordination of the irritable self, the mere vehicle of an idea or
combination which, being produced by the sum total of the human race,
must belong to that multiple entity, from the accomplished lecturer or
populariser who transmits it, to the remotest generation of Fuegians or
Hottentots, however indifferent these may be to the superiority of their
right above that of the eminently perishable dyspeptic author.One may admit that such considerations carry a profound truth to be
even religiously contemplated, and yet object all the more to the mode
in which Euphorion seems to apply them.I protest against the use of
these majestic conceptions to do the dirty work of unscrupulosity and
justify the non-payment of conscious debts which cannot be defined or
enforced by the law.Especially since it is observable that the large
views as to intellectual property which can apparently reconcile an
able person to the use of lately borrowed ideas as if they were his
own, when this spoliation is favoured by the public darkness, never
hinder him from joining in the zealous tribute of recognition and
applause to those warriors of Truth whose triumphal arches are seen in
the public ways, those conquerors whose battles and "annexations" even
the carpenters and bricklayers know by name.Surely the acknowledgment
of a mental debt which will not be immediately detected, and may never
be asserted, is a case to which the traditional susceptibility to
"debts of honour" would be suitably transferred.There is no massive
public opinion that can be expected to tell on these relations of
thinkers and investigators&mdash;relations to be thoroughly understood
and felt only by those who are interested in the life of ideas and
acquainted with their history.To lay false claim to an invention or
discovery which has an immediate market value; to vamp up a
professedly new book of reference by stealing from the pages of one
already produced at the cost of much labour and material; to copy
somebody else's poem and send the manuscript to a magazine, or hand it
about among; friends as an original "effusion;" to deliver an elegant
extract from a known writer as a piece of improvised
eloquence:&mdash;these are the limits within which the dishonest
pretence of originality is likely to get hissed or hooted and bring
more or less shame on the culprit.It is not necessary to understand
the merit of a performance, or even to spell with any comfortable
confidence, in order to perceive at once that such pretences are not
respectable.But the difference between these vulgar frauds, these
devices of ridiculous jays whose ill-secured plumes are seen falling
off them as they run, and the quiet appropriation of other people's
philosophic or scientific ideas, can hardly be held to lie in their
moral quality unless we take impunity as our criterion.The pitiable
jays had no presumption in their favour and foolishly fronted an alert
incredulity; but Euphorion, the accomplished theorist, has an audience
who expect much of him, and take it as the most natural thing in the
world that every unusual view which he presents anonymously should be
due solely to his ingenuity.His borrowings are no incongruous
feathers awkwardly stuck on; they have an appropriateness which makes
them seem an answer to anticipation, like the return phrases of a
melody.Certainly one cannot help the ignorant conclusions of polite
society, and there are perhaps fashionable persons who, if a speaker
has occasion to explain what the occipat is, will consider that he has
lately discovered that curiously named portion of the animal frame:
one cannot give a genealogical introduction to every long-stored item
of fact or conjecture that may happen to be a revelation for the large
class of persons who are understood to judge soundly on a small basis
of knowledge.But Euphorion would be very sorry to have it supposed
that he is unacquainted with the history of ideas, and sometimes
carries even into minutiae the evidence of his exact registration of
names in connection with quotable phrases or suggestions: I can
therefore only explain the apparent infirmity of his memory in cases
of larger "conveyance" by supposing that he is accustomed by the very
association of largeness to range them at once under those grand laws
of the universe in the light of which Mine and Thine disappear and are
resolved into Everybody's or Nobody's, and one man's particular
obligations to another melt untraceably into the obligations of the
earth to the solar system in general.Euphorion himself, if a particular omission of acknowledgment were
brought home to him, would probably take a narrower ground of
explanation.It was a lapse of memory; or it did not occur to him as
necessary in this case to mention a name, the source being well
known--or (since this seems usually to act as a strong reason for
mention) he rather abstained from adducing the name because it might
injure the excellent matter advanced, just as an obscure trade-mark
casts discredit on a good commodity, and even on the retailer who has
furnished himself from a quarter not likely to be esteemed first-rate.No doubt this last is a genuine and frequent reason for the
non-acknowledgment of indebtedness to what one may call impersonal as
well as personal sources: even an American editor of school classics
whose own English could not pass for more than a syntactical shoddy of
the cheapest sort, felt it unfavourable to his reputation for sound
learning that he should be obliged to the Penny Cyclopaedia, and
disguised his references to it under contractions in which _Us.took the place of the low word _Penny_.Works of this convenient stamp,
easily obtained and well nourished with matter, are felt to be like rich
but unfashionable relations who are visited and received in privacy, and
whose capital is used or inherited without any ostentatious insistance
on their names and places of abode.As to memory, it is known that this
frail faculty naturally lets drop the facts which are less flattering to
our self-love--when it does not retain them carefully as subjects not to
be approached, marshy spots with a warning flag over them.But it is
always interesting to bring forward eminent names, such as Patricius or
Scaliger, Euler or Lagrange, Bopp or Humboldt.To know exactly what has
been drawn from them is erudition and heightens our own influence, which
seems advantageous to mankind; whereas to cite an author whose ideas may
pass as higher currency under our own signature can have no object
except the contradictory one of throwing the illumination over his
figure when it is important to be seen oneself.All these reasons must
weigh considerably with those speculative persons who have to ask
themselves whether or not Universal Utilitarianism requires that in the
particular instance before them they should injure a man who has been of
service to them, and rob a fellow-workman of the credit which is due to
him.After all, however, it must be admitted that hardly any accusation is
more difficult to prove, and more liable to be false, than that of a
plagiarism which is the conscious theft of ideas and deliberate
reproduction of them as original.The arguments on the side of acquittal
are obvious and strong:--the inevitable coincidences of contemporary
thinking; and our continual experience of finding notions turning up in
our minds without any label on them to tell us whence they came; so that
if we are in the habit of expecting much from our own capacity we accept
them at once as a new inspiration.Then, in relation to the elder
authors, there is the difficulty first of learning and then of
remembering exactly what has been wrought into the backward tapestry of
the world's history, together with the fact that ideas acquired long ago
reappear as the sequence of an awakened interest or a line of inquiry
which is really new in us, whence it is conceivable that if we were
ancients some of us might be offering grateful hecatombs by mistake, and
proving our honesty in a ruinously expensive manner.On the other hand,
the evidence on which plagiarism is concluded is often of a kind which,
though much trusted in questions of erudition and historical criticism,
is apt to lead us injuriously astray in our daily judgments, especially
of the resentful, condemnatory sort.How Pythagoras came by his ideas,
whether St Paul was acquainted with all the Greek poets, what Tacitus
must have known by hearsay and systematically ignored, are points on
which a false persuasion of knowledge is less damaging to justice and
charity than an erroneous confidence, supported by reasoning
fundamentally similar, of my neighbour's blameworthy behaviour in a case
where I am personally concerned.No premisses require closer scrutiny
than those which lead to the constantly echoed conclusion, "He must have
known," or "He must have read."I marvel that this facility of belief on
the side of knowledge can subsist under the daily demonstration that the
easiest of all things to the human mind is _not_ to know and _not_ to
read.To praise, to blame, to shout, grin, or hiss, where others shout,
grin, or hiss--these are native tendencies; but to know and to read are
artificial, hard accomplishments, concerning which the only safe
supposition is, that as little of them has been done as the case admits.An author, keenly conscious of having written, can hardly help imagining
his condition of lively interest to be shared by others, just as we are
all apt to suppose that the chill or heat we are conscious of must be
general, or even to think that our sons and daughters, our pet schemes,
and our quarrelling correspondence, are themes to which intelligent
persons will listen long without weariness.But if the ardent author
happen to be alive to practical teaching he will soon learn to divide
the larger part of the enlightened public into those who have not read
him and think it necessary to tell him so when they meet him in polite
society, and those who have equally abstained from reading him, but wish
to conceal this negation and speak of his "incomparable works" with that
trust in testimony which always has its cheering side.Hence it is worse than foolish to entertain silent suspicions of
plagiarism, still more to give them voice, when they are founded on a
construction of probabilities which a little more attention to everyday
occurrences as a guide in reasoning would show us to be really
worthless, considered as proof.The length to which one man's memory can
go in letting drop associations that are vital to another can hardly
find a limit.It is not to be supposed that a person desirous to make an
agreeable impression on you would deliberately choose to insist to you,
with some rhetorical sharpness, on an argument which you were the first
to elaborate in public; yet any one who listens may overhear such
instances of obliviousness.You naturally remember your peculiar
connection with your acquaintance's judicious views; but why should
_he_?Your fatherhood, which is an intense feeling to you, is only an
additional fact of meagre interest for him to remember; and a sense of
obligation to the particular living fellow-struggler who has helped us
in our thinking, is not yet a form of memory the want of which is felt
to be disgraceful or derogatory, unless it is taken to be a want of
polite instruction, or causes the missing of a cockade on a day of
celebration.In our suspicions of plagiarism we must recognise as the
first weighty probability, that what we who feel injured remember best
is precisely what is least likely to enter lastingly into the memory of
our neighbours.But it is fair to maintain that the neighbour who
borrows your property, loses it for a while, and when it turns up again
forgets your connection with it and counts it his own, shows himself so
much the feebler in grasp and rectitude of mind.Some absent persons
cannot remember the state of wear in their own hats and umbrellas, and
have no mental check to tell them that they have carried home a
fellow-visitor's more recent purchase: they may be excellent
householders, far removed from the suspicion of low devices, but one
wishes them a more correct perception, and a more wary sense that a
neighbours umbrella may be newer than their own.True, some persons are so constituted that the very excellence of an
idea seems to them a convincing reason that it must be, if not solely,
yet especially theirs.It fits in so beautifully with their general
wisdom, it lies implicitly in so many of their manifested opinions, that
if they have not yet expressed it (because of preoccupation) it is
clearly a part of their indigenous produce, and is proved by their
immediate eloquent promulgation of it to belong more naturally and
appropriately to them than to the person who seemed first to have
alighted on it, and who sinks in their all-originating consciousness to
that low kind of entity, a second cause.This is not lunacy, nor
pretence, but a genuine state of mind very effective in practice, and
often carrying the public with it, so that the poor Columbus is found to
be a very faulty adventurer, and the continent is named after Amerigo.Lighter examples of this instinctive appropriation are constantly met
with among brilliant talkers.Aquila is too agreeable and amusing for
any one who is not himself bent on display to be angry at his
conversational rapine--his habit of darting down on every morsel of
booty that other birds may hold in their beaks, with an innocent air, as
if it were all intended for his use, and honestly counted on by him as a
tribute in kind.Hardly any man, I imagine, can have had less trouble in
gathering a showy stock of information than Aquila.On close inquiry you
would probably find that he had not read one epoch-making book of modern
times, for he has a career which obliges him to much correspondence and
other official work, and he is too fond of being in company to spend his
leisure moments in study; but to his quick eye, ear, and tongue, a few
predatory excursions in conversation where there are instructed persons,
gradually furnish surprisingly clever modes of statement and allusion on
the dominant topic.When he first adopts a subject he necessarily falls
into mistakes, and it is interesting to watch his gradual progress into
fuller information and better nourished irony, without his ever needing
to admit that he has made a blunder or to appear conscious of
correction.Suppose, for example, he had incautiously founded some
ingenious remarks on a hasty reckoning that nine thirteens made a
hundred and two, and the insignificant Bantam, hitherto silent, seemed
to spoil the flow of ideas by stating that the product could not be
taken as less than a hundred and seventeen, Aquila would glide on in the
most graceful manner from a repetition of his previous remark to the
continuation--"All this is on the supposition that a hundred and two
were all that could be got out of nine thirteens; but as all the world
knows that nine thirteens will yield," &c.--proceeding straightway into
a new train of ingenious consequences, and causing Bantam to be regarded
by all present as one of those slow persons who take irony for
ignorance, and who would warn the weasel to keep awake.How should a
small-eyed, feebly crowing mortal like him be quicker in arithmetic than
the keen-faced forcible Aquila, in whom universal knowledge is easily
credible?Looked into closely, the conclusion from a man's profile,
voice, and fluency to his certainty in multiplication beyond the
twelves, seems to show a confused notion of the way in which very common
things are connected; but it is on such false correlations that men
found half their inferences about each other, and high places of trust
may sometimes be held on no better foundation.It is a commonplace that words, writings, measures, and performances in
general, have qualities assigned them not by a direct judgment on the
performances themselves, but by a presumption of what they are likely to
be, considering who is the performer.We all notice in our neighbours
this reference to names as guides in criticism, and all furnish
illustrations of it in our own practice; for, check ourselves as we
will, the first impression from any sort of work must depend on a
previous attitude of mind, and this will constantly be determined by the
influences of a name.But that our prior confidence or want of
confidence in given names is made up of judgments just as hollow as the
consequent praise or blame they are taken to warrant, is less commonly
perceived, though there is a conspicuous indication of it in the
surprise or disappointment often manifested in the disclosure of an
authorship about which everybody has been making wrong guesses.No doubt
if it had been discovered who wrote the 'Vestiges,' many an ingenious
structure of probabilities would have been spoiled, and some disgust
might have been felt for a real author who made comparatively so shabby
an appearance of likelihood.It is this foolish trust in prepossessions,
founded on spurious evidence, which makes a medium of encouragement for
those who, happening to have the ear of the public, give other people's
ideas the advantage of appearing under their own well-received name,
while any remonstrance from the real producer becomes an each person who
has paid complimentary tributes in the wrong place.Hardly any kind of false reasoning is more ludicrous than this on the
probabilities of origination.It would be amusing to catechise the
guessers as to their exact reasons for thinking their guess "likely:"
why Hoopoe of John's has fixed on Toucan of Magdalen; why Shrike
attributes its peculiar style to Buzzard, who has not hitherto been
known as a writer; why the fair Columba thinks it must belong to the
reverend Merula; and why they are all alike disturbed in their previous
judgment of its value by finding that it really came from Skunk, whom
they had either not thought of at all, or thought of as belonging to a
species excluded by the nature of the case.Clearly they were all wrong
in their notion of the specific conditions, which lay unexpectedly in
the small Skunk, and in him alone--in spite of his education nobody
knows where, in spite of somebody's knowing his uncles and cousins, and
in spite of nobody's knowing that he was cleverer than they thought him.Such guesses remind one of a fabulist's imaginary council of animals
assembled to consider what sort of creature had constructed a honeycomb
found and much tasted by Bruin and other epicures.The speakers all
started from the probability that the maker was a bird, because this was
the quarter from which a wondrous nest might be expected; for the
animals at that time, knowing little of their own history, would have
rejected as inconceivable the notion that a nest could be made by a
fish; and as to the insects, they were not willingly received in society
and their ways were little known.Several complimentary presumptions
were expressed that the honeycomb was due to one or the other admired
and popular bird, and there was much fluttering on the part of the
Nightingale and Swallow, neither of whom gave a positive denial, their
confusion perhaps extending to their sense of identity; but the Owl
hissed at this folly, arguing from his particular knowledge that the
animal which produced honey must be the Musk-rat, the wondrous nature of
whose secretions required no proof; and, in the powerful logical
procedure of the Owl, from musk to honey was but a step.Some
disturbance arose hereupon, for the Musk-rat began to make himself
obtrusive, believing in the Owl's opinion of his powers, and feeling
that he could have produced the honey if he had thought of it; until an
experimental Butcher-bird proposed to anatomise him as a help to
decision.The hubbub increased, the opponents of the Musk-rat inquiring
who his ancestors were; until a diversion was created by an able
discourse of the Macaw on structures generally, which he classified so
as to include the honeycomb, entering into so much admirable exposition
that there was a prevalent sense of the honeycomb having probably been
produced by one who understood it so well.But Bruin, who had probably
eaten too much to listen with edification, grumbled in his low kind of
language, that "Fine words butter no parsnips," by which he meant to say
that there was no new honey forthcoming.Perhaps the audience generally was beginning to tire, when the Fox
entered with his snout dreadfully swollen, and reported that the
beneficent originator in question was the Wasp, which he had found much
smeared with undoubted honey, having applied his nose to it--whence
indeed the able insect, perhaps justifiably irritated at what might seem
a sign of scepticism, had stung him with some severity, an infliction
Reynard could hardly regret, since the swelling of a snout normally so
delicate would corroborate his statement and satisfy the assembly that
he had really found the honey-creating genius.The Fox's admitted acuteness, combined with the visible swelling, were
taken as undeniable evidence, and the revelation undoubtedly met a
general desire for information on a point of interest.Nevertheless,
there was a murmur the reverse of delighted, and the feelings of some
eminent animals were too strong for them: the Orang-outang's jaw dropped
so as seriously to impair the vigour of his expression, the edifying
Pelican screamed and flapped her wings, the Owl hissed again, the Macaw
became loudly incoherent, and the Gibbon gave his hysterical laugh;
while the Hyaena, after indulging in a more splenetic guffaw, agitated
the question whether it would not be better to hush up the whole affair,
instead of giving public recognition to an insect whose produce, it was
now plain, had been much overestimated.But this narrow-spirited motion
was negatived by the sweet-toothed majority.A complimentary deputation
to the Wasp was resolved on, and there was a confident hope that this
diplomatic measure would tell on the production of honey.Ganymede was once a girlishly handsome precocious youth.That one cannot
for any considerable number of years go on being youthful, girlishly
handsome, and precocious, seems on consideration to be a statement as
worthy of credit as the famous syllogistic conclusion, "Socrates was
mortal."But many circumstances have conspired to keep up in Ganymede
the illusion that he is surprisingly young.He was the last born of his
family, and from his earliest memory was accustomed to be commended as
such to the care of his elder brothers and sisters: he heard his mother
speak of him as her youngest darling with a loving pathos in her tone,
which naturally suffused his own view of himself, and gave him the
habitual consciousness of being at once very young and very interesting.Then, the disclosure of his tender years was a constant matter of
astonishment to strangers who had had proof of his precocious talents,
and the astonishment extended to what is called the world at large when
he produced 'A Comparative Estimate of European Nations' before he was
well out of his teens.All comers, on a first interview, told him that
he was marvellously young, and some repeated the statement each time
they saw him; all critics who wrote about him called attention to the
same ground for wonder: his deficiencies and excesses were alike to be
accounted for by the flattering fact of his youth, and his youth was the
golden background which set off his many-hued endowments.Here was
already enough to establish a strong association between his sense of
identity and his sense of being unusually young.But after this he
devised and founded an ingenious organisation for consolidating the
literary interests of all the four continents (subsequently including
Australasia and Polynesia), he himself presiding in the central office,
which thus became a new theatre for the constantly repeated situation of
an astonished stranger in the presence of a boldly scheming
administrator found to be remarkably young.If we imagine with due
charity the effect on Ganymede, we shall think it greatly to his credit
that he continued to feel the necessity of being something more than
young, and did not sink by rapid degrees into a parallel of that
melancholy object, a superannuated youthful phenomenon.Happily he had
enough of valid, active faculty to save him from that tragic fate.He
had not exhausted his fountain of eloquent opinion in his 'Comparative
Estimate,' so as to feel himself, like some other juvenile celebrities,
the sad survivor of his own manifest destiny, or like one who has risen
too early in the morning, and finds all the solid day turned into a
fatigued afternoon.He has continued to be productive both of schemes
and writings, being perhaps helped by the fact that his 'Comparative
Estimate' did not greatly affect the currents of European thought, and
left him with the stimulating hope that he had not done his best, but
might yet produce what would make his youth more surprising than ever.I saw something of him through his Antinoues period, the time of rich
chesnut locks, parted not by a visible white line, but by a shadowed
furrow from which they fell in massive ripples to right and left.In
these slim days he looked the younger for being rather below the middle
size, and though at last one perceived him contracting an indefinable
air of self-consciousness, a slight exaggeration of the facial
movements, the attitudes, the little tricks, and the romance in
shirt-collars, which must be expected from one who, in spite of his
knowledge, was so exceedingly young, it was impossible to say that he
was making any great mistake about himself.He was only undergoing one
form of a common moral disease: being strongly mirrored for himself in
the remark of others, he was getting to see his real characteristics as
a dramatic part, a type to which his doings were always in
correspondence.Owing to my absence on travel and to other causes I had
lost sight of him for several years, but such a separation between two
who have not missed each other seems in this busy century only a
pleasant reason, when they happen to meet again in some old accustomed
haunt, for the one who has stayed at home to be more communicative about
himself than he can well be to those who have all along been in his
neighbourhood.He had married in the interval, and as if to keep up his
surprising youthfulness in all relations, he had taken a wife
considerably older than himself.It would probably have seemed to him a
disturbing inversion of the natural order that any one very near to him
should have been younger than he, except his own children who, however
young, would not necessarily hinder the normal surprise at the
youthfulness of their father.And if my glance had revealed my
impression on first seeing him again, he might have received a rather
disagreeable shock, which was far from my intention.My mind, having
retained a very exact image of his former appearance, took note of
unmistakeable changes such as a painter would certainly not have made by
way of flattering his subject.He had lost his slimness, and that curved
solidity which might have adorned a taller man was a rather sarcastic
threat to his short figure.The English branch of the Teutonic race does
not produce many fat youths, and I have even heard an American lady say
that she was much "disappointed" at the moderate number and size of our
fat men, considering their reputation in the United States; hence a
stranger would now have been apt to remark that Ganymede was unusually
plump for a distinguished writer, rather than unusually young.Many long-standing prepossessions are as hard to be
corrected as a long-standing mispronunciation, against which the direct
experience of eye and ear is often powerless.And I could perceive that
Ganymede's inwrought sense of his surprising youthfulness had been
stronger than the superficial reckoning of his years and the merely
optical phenomena of the looking-glass.He now held a post under
Government, and not only saw, like most subordinate functionaries, how
ill everything was managed, but also what were the changes that a high
constructive ability would dictate; and in mentioning to me his own
speeches and other efforts towards propagating reformatory views in his
department, he concluded by changing his tone to a sentimental head
voice and saying--

"But I am so young; people object to any prominence on my part; I can
only get myself heard anonymously, and when some attention has been
drawn the name is sure to creep out.The writer is known to be young,
and things are none the forwarder.""Well," said I, "youth seems the only drawback that is sure to diminish.You and I have seven years less of it than when we last met."returned Ganymede, as lightly as possible, at the same time
casting an observant glance over me, as if he were marking the effect of
seven years on a person who had probably begun life with an old look,
and even as an infant had given his countenance to that significant
doctrine, the transmigration of ancient souls into modern bodies.I left him on that occasion without any melancholy forecast that his
illusion would be suddenly or painfully broken up.I saw that he was
well victualled and defended against a ten years' siege from ruthless
facts; and in the course of time observation convinced me that his
resistance received considerable aid from without.Each of his written
productions, as it came out, was still commented on as the work of a
very young man.One critic, finding that he wanted solidity, charitably
referred to his youth as an excuse.Another, dazzled by his brilliancy,
seemed to regard his youth as so wondrous that all other authors
appeared decrepit by comparison, and their style such as might be looked
for from gentlemen of the old school.Able pens (according to a familiar
metaphor) appeared to shake their heads good-humouredly, implying that
Ganymede's crudities were pardonable in one so exceedingly young.Such
unanimity amid diversity, which a distant posterity might take for
evidence that on the point of age at least there could have been no
mistake, was not really more difficult to account for than the
prevalence of cotton in our fabrics.Ganymede had been first introduced
into the writing world as remarkably young, and it was no exceptional
consequence that the first deposit of information about him held its
ground against facts which, however open to observation, were not
necessarily thought of.It is not so easy, with our rates and taxes and
need for economy in all directions, to cast away an epithet or remark
that turns up cheaply, and to go in expensive search after more genuine
substitutes.There is high Homeric precedent for keeping fast hold of an
epithet under all changes of circumstance, and so the precocious author
of the 'Comparative Estimate' heard the echoes repeating "Young
Ganymede" when an illiterate beholder at a railway station would have
given him forty years at least.Besides, important elders, sachems of
the clubs and public meetings, had a genuine opinion of him as young
enough to be checked for speech on subjects which they had spoken
mistakenly about when he was in his cradle; and then, the midway parting
of his crisp hair, not common among English committee-men, formed a
presumption against the ripeness of his judgment which nothing but a
speedy baldness could have removed.It is but fair to mention all these outward confirmations of Ganymede's
illusion, which shows no signs of leaving him.It is true that he no
longer hears expressions of surprise at his youthfulness, on a first
introduction to an admiring reader; but this sort of external evidence
has become an unnecessary crutch to his habitual inward persuasion.His
manners, his costume, his suppositions of the impression he makes on
others, have all their former correspondence with the dramatic part of
the young genius.As to the incongruity of his contour and other little
accidents of physique, he is probably no more aware that they will
affect others as incongruities than Armida is conscious how much her
rouge provokes our notice of her wrinkles, and causes us to mention
sarcastically that motherly age which we should otherwise regard with
affectionate reverence.But let us be just enough to admit that there may be old-young coxcombs
as well as old-young coquettes.HOW WE COME TO GIVE OURSELVES FALSE TESTIMONIALS, AND BELIEVE IN THEM.It is my way when I observe any instance of folly, any queer habit, any
absurd illusion, straightway to look for something of the same type in
myself, feeling sure that amid all differences there will be a certain
correspondence; just as there is more or less correspondence in the
natural history even of continents widely apart, and of islands in
opposite zones.No doubt men's minds differ in what we may call their
climate or share of solar energy, and a feeling or tendency which is
comparable to a panther in one may have no more imposing aspect than
that of a weasel in another: some are like a tropical habitat in which
the very ferns cast a mighty shadow, and the grasses are a dry ocean in
which a hunter may be submerged; others like the chilly latitudes in
which your forest-tree, fit elsewhere to prop a mine, is a pretty
miniature suitable for fancy potting.The eccentric man might be
typified by the Australian fauna, refuting half our judicious
assumptions of what nature allows.Still, whether fate commanded us to
thatch our persons among the Eskimos or to choose the latest thing in
tattooing among the Polynesian isles, our precious guide Comparison
would teach us in the first place by likeness, and our clue to further
knowledge would be resemblance to what we already know.Hence, having a
keen interest in the natural history of my inward self, I pursue this
plan I have mentioned of using my observation as a clue or lantern by
which I detect small herbage or lurking life; or I take my neighbour in
his least becoming tricks or efforts as an opportunity for luminous
deduction concerning the figure the human genus makes in the specimen
which I myself furnish.Introspection which starts with the purpose of finding out one's own
absurdities is not likely to be very mischievous, yet of course it is
not free from dangers any more than breathing is, or the other functions
that keep us alive and active.To judge of others by oneself is in its
most innocent meaning the briefest expression for our only method of
knowing mankind; yet, we perceive, it has come to mean in many cases
either the vulgar mistake which reduces every man's value to the very
low figure at which the valuer himself happens to stand; or else, the
amiable illusion of the higher nature misled by a too generous
construction of the lower.One cannot give a recipe for wise judgment:
it resembles appropriate muscular action, which is attained by the
myriad lessons in nicety of balance and of aim that only practice can
give.The danger of the inverse procedure, judging of self by what one
observes in others, if it is carried on with much impartiality and
keenness of discernment, is that it has a laming effect, enfeebling the
energies of indignation and scorn, which are the proper scourges of
wrong-doing and meanness, and which should continually feed the
wholesome restraining power of public opinion.I respect the horsewhip
when applied to the back of Cruelty, and think that he who applies it is
a more perfect human being because his outleap of indignation is not
checked by a too curious reflection on the nature of guilt--a more
perfect human being because he more completely incorporates the best
social life of the race, which can never be constituted by ideas that
nullify action.This is the essence of Dante's sentiment (it is painful
to think that he applies it very cruelly)--

  "E cortesia fu, lui esser villano"[1]--

and it is undeniable that a too intense consciousness of one's kinship
with all frailties and vices undermines the active heroism which battles
against wrong.But certainly nature has taken care that this danger should not at
present be very threatening.One could not fairly describe the
generality of one's neighbours as too lucidly aware of manifesting in
their own persons the weaknesses which they observe in the rest of her
Majesty's subjects; on the contrary, a hasty conclusion as to schemes of
Providence might lead to the supposition that one man was intended to
correct another by being most intolerant of the ugly quality or trick
which he himself possesses.Doubtless philosophers will be able to
explain how it must necessarily be so, but pending the full extension of
the _a priori_ method, which will show that only blockheads could expect
anything to be otherwise, it does seem surprising that Heloisa should be
disgusted at Laura's attempts to disguise her age, attempts which she
recognises so thoroughly because they enter into her own practice; that
Semper, who often responds at public dinners and proposes resolutions on
platforms, though he has a trying gestation of every speech and a bad
time for himself and others at every delivery, should yet remark
pitilessly on the folly of precisely the same course of action in
Ubique; that Aliquis, who lets no attack on himself pass unnoticed, and
for every handful of gravel against his windows sends a stone in reply,
should deplore the ill-advised retorts of Quispiam, who does not
perceive that to show oneself angry with an adversary is to gratify him.To be unaware of our own little tricks of manner or our own mental
blemishes and excesses is a comprehensible unconsciousness; the puzzling
fact is that people should apparently take no account of their
deliberate actions, and should expect them to be equally ignored by
others.It is an inversion of the accepted order: _there_ it is the
phrases that are official and the conduct or privately manifested
sentiment that is taken to be real; _here_ it seems that the practice is
taken to be official and entirely nullified by the verbal representation
which contradicts it.The thief making a vow to heaven of full
restitution and whispering some reservations, expecting to cheat
Omniscience by an "aside," is hardly more ludicrous than the many ladies
and gentlemen who have more belief, and expect others to have it, in
their own statement about their habitual doings than in the
contradictory fact which is patent in the daylight.One reason of the
absurdity is that we are led by a tradition about ourselves, so that
long after a man has practically departed from a rule or principle, he
continues innocently to state it as a true description of his
practice--just as he has a long tradition that he is not an old
gentleman, and is startled when he is seventy at overhearing himself
called by an epithet which he has only applied to others.[Footnote 1: Inferno, xxxii."A person with your tendency of constitution should take as little sugar
as possible," said Pilulus to Bovis somewhere in the darker decades of
this century."It has made a great difference to Avis since he took my
advice in that matter: he used to consume half a pound a-day.""Twenty-six large lumps every day of your life, Mr Bovis," says his
wife."You drop them into your tea, coffee, and whisky yourself, my dear, and
I count them."laughs Bovis, turning to Pilulus, that they may exchange a
glance of mutual amusement at a woman's inaccuracy.Bovis had never said inwardly that he
would take a large allowance of sugar, and he had the tradition about
himself that he was a man of the most moderate habits; hence, with this
conviction, he was naturally disgusted at the saccharine excesses of
Avis.I have sometimes thought that this facility of men in believing that
they are still what they once meant to be--this undisturbed
appropriation of a traditional character which is often but a melancholy
relic of early resolutions, like the worn and soiled testimonial to
soberness and honesty carried in the pocket of a tippler whom the need
of a dram has driven into peculation--may sometimes diminish the
turpitude of what seems a flat, barefaced falsehood.It is notorious
that a man may go on uttering false assertions about his own acts till
he at last believes in them: is it not possible that sometimes in the
very first utterance there may be a shade of creed-reciting belief, a
reproduction of a traditional self which is clung to against all
evidence?There is no knowing all the disguises of the lying serpent.When we come to examine in detail what is the sane mind in the sane
body, the final test of completeness seems to be a security of
distinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what
we have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and
what we have witnessed or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in
the present and what we thought and felt in the past.I know that there is a common prejudice which regards the habitual
confusion of _now_ and _then_, of _it was_ and _it is_, of _it seemed
so_ and _I should like it to be so_, as a mark of high imaginative
endowment, while the power of precise statement and description is rated
lower, as the attitude of an everyday prosaic mind.High imagination is
often assigned or claimed as if it were a ready activity in fabricating
extravagances such as are presented by fevered dreams, or as if its
possessors were in that state of inability to give credible testimony
which would warrant their exclusion from the class of acceptable
witnesses in a court of justice; so that a creative genius might fairly
be subjected to the disability which some laws have stamped on dicers,
slaves, and other classes whose position was held perverting to their
sense of social responsibility.This endowment of mental confusion is often boasted of by persons whose
imaginativeness would not otherwise be known, unless it were by the slow
process of detecting that their descriptions and narratives were not to
be trusted.Callista is always ready to testify of herself that she is
an imaginative person, and sometimes adds in illustration, that if she
had taken a walk and seen an old heap of stones on her way, the account
she would give on returning would include many pleasing particulars of
her own invention, transforming the simple heap into an interesting
castellated ruin.This creative freedom is all very well in the right
place, but before I can grant it to be a sign of unusual mental power, I
must inquire whether, on being requested to give a precise description
of what she saw, she would be able to cast aside her arbitrary
combinations and recover the objects she really perceived so as to make
them recognisable by another person who passed the same way.Otherwise
her glorifying imagination is not an addition to the fundamental power
of strong, discerning perception, but a cheaper substitute.And, in
fact, I find on listening to Callista's conversation, that she has a
very lax conception even of common objects, and an equally lax memory of
events.It seems of no consequence to her whether she shall say that a
stone is overgrown with moss or with lichen, that a building is of
sandstone or of granite, that Meliboeus once forgot to put on his cravat
or that he always appears without it; that everybody says so, or that
one stock-broker's wife said so yesterday; that Philemon praised
Euphemia up to the skies, or that he denied knowing any particular evil
of her.She is one of those respectable witnesses who would testify to
the exact moment of an apparition, because any desirable moment will be
as exact as another to her remembrance; or who would be the most worthy
to witness the action of spirits on slates and tables because the action
of limbs would not probably arrest her attention.She would describe the
surprising phenomena exhibited by the powerful Medium with the same
freedom that she vaunted in relation to the old heap of stones.Her
supposed imaginativeness is simply a very usual lack of discriminating
perception, accompanied with a less usual activity of misrepresentation,
which, if it had been a little more intense, or had been stimulated by
circumstance, might have made her a profuse writer unchecked by the
troublesome need of veracity.These characteristics are the very opposite of such as yield a fine
imagination, which is always based on a keen vision, a keen
consciousness of what _is_, and carries the store of definite knowledge
as material for the construction of its inward visions.Witness Dante,
who is at once the most precise and homely in his reproduction of actual
objects, and the most soaringly at large in his imaginative
combinations.On a much lower level we distinguish the hyperbole and
rapid development in descriptions of persons and events which are lit up
by humorous intention in the speaker--we distinguish this charming play
of intelligence which resembles musical improvisation on a given motive,
where the farthest sweep of curve is looped into relevancy by an
instinctive method, from the florid inaccuracy or helpless exaggeration
which is really something commoner than the correct simplicity often
depreciated as prosaic.Even if high imagination were to be identified with illusion, there
would be the same sort of difference between the imperial wealth of
illusion which is informed by industrious submissive observation and the
trumpery stage-property illusion which depends on the ill-defined
impressions gathered by capricious inclination, as there is between a
good and a bad picture of the Last Judgment.In both these the subject
is a combination never actually witnessed, and in the good picture the
general combination may be of surpassing boldness; but on examination it
is seen that the separate elements have been closely studied from real
objects.And even where we find the charm of ideal elevation with wrong
drawing and fantastic colour, the charm is dependent on the selective
sensibility of the painter to certain real delicacies of form which
confer the expression he longed to render; for apart from this basis of
an effect perceived in common, there could be no conveyance of aesthetic
meaning by the painter to the beholder.In this sense it is as true to
say of Fra Angelico's Coronation of the Virgin, that it has a strain of
reality, as to say so of a portrait by Rembrandt, which also has its
strain of ideal elevation due to Rembrandt's virile selective
sensibility.To correct such self-flatterers as Callista, it is worth
repeating that powerful imagination is not false outward vision, but
intense inward representation, and a creative energy constantly fed by
susceptibility to the veriest minutiae of experience, which it
reproduces and constructs in fresh and fresh wholes; not the habitual
confusion of provable fact with the fictions of fancy and transient
inclination, but a breadth of ideal association which informs every
material object, every incidental fact with far-reaching memories and
stored residues of passion, bringing into new light the less obvious
relations of human existence.The illusion to which it is liable is not
that of habitually taking duck-ponds for lilied pools, but of being more
or less transiently and in varying degrees so absorbed in ideal vision
as to lose the consciousness of surrounding objects or occurrences; and
when that rapt condition is past, the sane genius discriminates clearly
between what has been given in this parenthetic state of excitement, and
what he has known, and may count on, in the ordinary world of
experience.Dante seems to have expressed these conditions perfectly in
that passage of the _Purgatorio_ where, after a triple vision which has
made him forget his surroundings, he says--

  "Quando l'anima mia torno di fuori
    Alle cose che son fuor di lei vere,
    Io riconobbi i miei non falsi errori."--(c xv)

He distinguishes the ideal truth of his entranced vision from the series
of external facts to which his consciousness had returned.Isaiah gives
us the date of his vision in the Temple--"the year that King Uzziah
died"--and if afterwards the mighty-winged seraphim were present with
him as he trod the street, he doubtless knew them for images of memory,
and did not cry "Look!"Certainly the seer, whether prophet, philosopher, scientific discoverer,
or poet, may happen to be rather mad: his powers may have been used up,
like Don Quixote's, in their visionary or theoretic constructions, so
that the reports of common-sense fail to affect him, or the continuous
strain of excitement may have robbed his mind of its elasticity.It is
hard for our frail mortality to carry the burthen of greatness with
steady gait and full alacrity of perception.But he is the strongest
seer who can support the stress of creative energy and yet keep that
sanity of expectation which consists in distinguishing, as Dante does,
between the _cose che son vere_ outside the individual mind, and the
_non falsi errori_ which are the revelations of true imaginative power.THE TOO READY WRITER

One who talks too much, hindering the rest of the company from taking
their turn, and apparently seeing no reason why they should not rather
desire to know his opinion or experience in relation to all subjects, or
at least to renounce the discussion of any topic where he can make no
figure, has never been praised for this industrious monopoly of work
which others would willingly have shared in.However various and
brilliant his talk may be, we suspect him of impoverishing us by
excluding the contributions of other minds, which attract our curiosity
the more because he has shut them up in silence.Besides, we get tired
of a "manner" in conversation as in painting, when one theme after
another is treated with the same lines and touches.I begin with a
liking for an estimable master, but by the time he has stretched his
interpretation of the world unbrokenly along a palatial gallery, I have
had what the cautious Scotch mind would call "enough" of him.There is
monotony and narrowness already to spare in my own identity; what comes
to me from without should be larger and more impartial than the judgment
of any single interpreter.On this ground even a modest person, without
power or will to shine in the conversation, may easily find the
predominating talker a nuisance, while those who are full of matter on
special topics are continually detecting miserably thin places in the
web of that information which he will not desist from imparting.Nobody
that I know of ever proposed a testimonial to a man for thus
volunteering the whole expense of the conversation.Why is there a different standard of judgment with regard to a writer
who plays much the same part in literature as the excessive talker plays
in what is traditionally called conversation?The busy Adrastus, whose
professional engagements might seem more than enough for the nervous
energy of one man, and who yet finds time to print essays on the chief
current subjects, from the tri-lingual inscriptions, or the Idea of the
Infinite among the prehistoric Lapps, to the Colorado beetle and the
grape disease in the south of France, is generally praised if not
admired for the breadth of his mental range and his gigantic powers of
work.Poor Theron, who has some original ideas on a subject to which he
has given years of research and meditation, has been waiting anxiously
from month to month to see whether his condensed exposition will find a
place in the next advertised programme, but sees it, on the contrary,
regularly excluded, and twice the space he asked for filled with the
copious brew of Adrastus, whose name carries custom like a celebrated
trade-mark.Why should the eager haste to tell what he thinks on the
shortest notice, as if his opinion were a needed preliminary to
discussion, get a man the reputation of being a conceited bore in
conversation, when nobody blames the same tendency if it shows itself in
print?The excessive talker can only be in one gathering at a time, and
there is the comfort of thinking that everywhere else other
fellow-citizens who have something to say may get a chance of delivering
themselves; but the exorbitant writer can occupy space and spread over
it the more or less agreeable flavour of his mind in four "mediums" at
once, and on subjects taken from the four winds.Such restless and
versatile occupants of literary space and time should have lived earlier
when the world wanted summaries of all extant knowledge, and this
knowledge being small, there was the more room for commentary and
conjecture.They might have played the part of an Isidor of Seville or a
Vincent of Beauvais brilliantly, and the willingness to write everything
themselves would have been strictly in place.In the present day, the
busy retailer of other people's knowledge which he has spoiled in the
handling, the restless guesser and commentator, the importunate hawker
of undesirable superfluities, the everlasting word-compeller who rises
early in the morning to praise what the world has already glorified, or
makes himself haggard at night in writing out his dissent from what
nobody ever believed, is not simply "gratis anhelans, multa agendo nihil
agens"--he is an obstruction.Like an incompetent architect with too
much interest at his back, he obtrudes his ill-considered work where
place ought to have been left to better men.Is it out of the question that we should entertain some scruple about
mixing our own flavour, as of the too cheap and insistent nutmeg, with
that of every great writer and every great subject?--especially when our
flavour is all we have to give, the matter or knowledge having been
already given by somebody else.What if we were only like the Spanish
wine-skins which impress the innocent stranger with the notion that the
Spanish grape has naturally a taste of leather?One could wish that even
the greatest minds should leave some themes unhandled, or at least leave
us no more than a paragraph or two on them to show how well they did in
not being more lengthy.Such entertainment of scruple can hardly be expected from the young; but
happily their readiness to mirror the universe anew for the rest of
mankind is not encouraged by easy publicity.In the vivacious Pepin I
have often seen the image of my early youth, when it seemed to me
astonishing that the philosophers had left so many difficulties
unsolved, and that so many great themes had raised no great poet to
treat them.I had an elated sense that I should find my brain full of
theoretic clues when I looked for them, and that wherever a poet had not
done what I expected, it was for want of my insight.Not knowing what
had been said about the play of Romeo and Juliet, I felt myself capable
of writing something original on its blemishes and beauties.In relation
to all subjects I had a joyous consciousness of that ability which is
prior to knowledge, and of only needing to apply myself in order to
master any task--to conciliate philosophers whose systems were at
present but dimly known to me, to estimate foreign poets whom I had not
yet read, to show up mistakes in an historical monograph that roused my
interest in an epoch which I had been hitherto ignorant of, when I
should once have had time to verify my views of probability by looking
into an encyclopaedia.So Pepin; save only that he is industrious while
I was idle.Like the astronomer in Rasselas, I swayed the universe in my
consciousness without making any difference outside me; whereas Pepin,
while feeling himself powerful with the stars in their courses, really
raises some dust here below.He is no longer in his spring-tide, but
having been always busy he has been obliged to use his first impressions
as if they were deliberate opinions, and to range himself on the
corresponding side in ignorance of much that he commits himself to; so
that he retains some characteristics of a comparatively tender age, and
among them a certain surprise that there have not been more persons
equal to himself.Perhaps it is unfortunate for him that he early gained
a hearing, or at least a place in print, and was thus encouraged in
acquiring a fixed habit of writing, to the exclusion of any other
bread-winning pursuit.He is already to be classed as a "general
writer," corresponding to the comprehensive wants of the "general
reader," and with this industry on his hands it is not enough for him to
keep up the ingenuous self-reliance of youth: he finds himself under an
obligation to be skilled in various methods of seeming to know; and
having habitually expressed himself before he was convinced, his
interest in all subjects is chiefly to ascertain that he has not made a
mistake, and to feel his infallibility confirmed.That impulse to
decide, that vague sense of being able to achieve the unattempted, that
dream of aerial unlimited movement at will without feet or wings, which
were once but the joyous mounting of young sap, are already taking shape
as unalterable woody fibre: the impulse has hardened into "style," and
into a pattern of peremptory sentences; the sense of ability in the
presence of other men's failures is turning into the official arrogance
of one who habitually issues directions which he has never himself been
called on to execute; the dreamy buoyancy of the stripling has taken on
a fatal sort of reality in written pretensions which carry consequences.He is on the way to become like the loud-buzzing, bouncing Bombus who
combines conceited illusions enough to supply several patients in a
lunatic asylum with the freedom to show himself at large in various
forms of print.If one who takes himself for the telegraphic centre of
all American wires is to be confined as unfit to transact affairs, what
shall we say to the man who believes himself in possession of the
unexpressed motives and designs dwelling in the breasts of all
sovereigns and all politicians?And I grieve to think that poor Pepin,
though less political, may by-and-by manifest a persuasion hardly more
sane, for he is beginning to explain people's writing by what he does
not know about them.Yet he was once at the comparatively innocent stage
which I have confessed to be that of my own early astonishment at my
powerful originality; and copying the just humility of the old Puritan,
I may say, "But for the grace of discouragement, this coxcombry might
have been mine."Pepin made for himself a necessity of writing (and getting printed)
before he had considered whether he had the knowledge or belief that
would furnish eligible matter.At first perhaps the necessity galled him
a little, but it is now as easily borne, nay, is as irrepressible a
habit as the outpouring of inconsiderate talk.He is gradually being
condemned to have no genuine impressions, no direct consciousness of
enjoyment or the reverse from the quality of what is before him: his
perceptions are continually arranging themselves in forms suitable to a
printed judgment, and hence they will often turn out to be as much to
the purpose if they are written without any direct contemplation of the
object, and are guided by a few external conditions which serve to
classify it for him.In this way he is irrevocably losing the faculty of
accurate mental vision: having bound himself to express judgments which
will satisfy some other demands than that of veracity, he has blunted
his perceptions by continual preoccupation.We cannot command veracity
at will: the power of seeing and reporting truly is a form of health
that has to be delicately guarded, and as an ancient Rabbi has solemnly
said, "The penalty of untruth is untruth."But Pepin is only a mild
example of the fact that incessant writing with a view to printing
carries internal consequences which have often the nature of disease.And however unpractical it may be held to consider whether we have
anything to print which it is good for the world to read, or which has
not been better said before, it will perhaps be allowed to be worth
considering what effect the printing may have on ourselves.Clearly
there is a sort of writing which helps to keep the writer in a
ridiculously contented ignorance; raising in him continually the sense
of having delivered himself effectively, so that the acquirement of more
thorough knowledge seems as superfluous as the purchase of costume for a
past occasion.He has invested his vanity (perhaps his hope of income)
in his own shallownesses and mistakes, and must desire their prosperity.Like the professional prophet, he learns to be glad of the harm that
keeps up his credit, and to be sorry for the good that contradicts him.It is hard enough for any of us, amid the changing winds of fortune and
the hurly-burly of events, to keep quite clear of a gladness which is
another's calamity; but one may choose not to enter on a course which
will turn such gladness into a fixed habit of mind, committing ourselves
to be continually pleased that others should appear to be wrong in order
that we may have the air of being right.In some cases, perhaps, it might be urged that Pepin has remained the
more self-contented because he has _not_ written everything he believed
himself capable of.He once asked me to read a sort of programme of the
species of romance which he should think it worth while to write--a
species which he contrasted in strong terms with the productions of
illustrious but overrated authors in this branch.Pepin's romance was to
present the splendours of the Roman Empire at the culmination of its
grandeur, when decadence was spiritually but not visibly imminent: it
was to show the workings of human passion in the most pregnant and
exalted of human circumstances, the designs of statesmen, the
interfusion of philosophies, the rural relaxation and converse of
immortal poets, the majestic triumphs of warriors, the mingling of the
quaint and sublime in religious ceremony, the gorgeous delirium of
gladiatorial shows, and under all the secretly working leaven of
Christianity.Such a romance would not call the attention of society to
the dialect of stable-boys, the low habits of rustics, the vulgarity of
small schoolmasters, the manners of men in livery, or to any other form
of uneducated talk and sentiments: its characters would have virtues and
vices alike on the grand scale, and would express themselves in an
English representing the discourse of the most powerful minds in the
best Latin, or possibly Greek, when there occurred a scene with a Greek
philosopher on a visit to Rome or resident there as a teacher.In this
way Pepin would do in fiction what had never been done before: something
not at all like 'Rienzi' or 'Notre Dame de Paris,' or any other attempt
of that kind; but something at once more penetrating and more
magnificent, more passionate and more philosophical, more panoramic yet
more select: something that would present a conception of a gigantic
period; in short something truly Roman and world-historical.When Pepin gave me this programme to read he was much younger than at
present.Some slight success in another vein diverted him from the
production of panoramic and select romance, and the experience of not
having tried to carry out his programme has naturally made him more
biting and sarcastic on the failures of those who have actually written
romances without apparently having had a glimpse of a conception equal
to his.Indeed, I am often comparing his rather touchingly inflated
_naivete_ as of a small young person walking on tiptoe while he is
talking of elevated things, at the time when he felt himself the author
of that unwritten romance, with his present epigrammatic curtness and
affectation of power kept strictly in reserve.His paragraphs now seem
to have a bitter smile in them, from the consciousness of a mind too
penetrating to accept any other man's ideas, and too equally competent
in all directions to seclude his power in any one form of creation, but
rather fitted to hang over them all as a lamp of guidance to the
stumblers below.You perceive how proud he is of not being indebted to
any writer: even with the dead he is on the creditor's side, for he is
doing them the service of letting the world know what they meant better
than those poor pre-Pepinians themselves had any means of doing, and he
treats the mighty shades very cavalierly.Is this fellow--citizen of ours, considered simply in the light of a
baptised Christian and tax-paying Englishman, really as madly
conceited, as empty of reverential feeling, as unveracious and careless
of justice, as full of catch-penny devices and stagey attitudinising as
on examination his writing shows itself to be?He has
arrived at his present pass in "the literary calling" through the
self-imposed obligation to give himself a manner which would convey the
impression of superior knowledge and ability.He is much worthier and
more admirable than his written productions, because the moral aspects
exhibited in his writing are felt to be ridiculous or disgraceful in the
personal relations of life.In blaming Pepin's writing we are accusing
the public conscience, which is so lax and ill informed on the momentous
bearings of authorship that it sanctions the total absence of scruple in
undertaking and prosecuting what should be the best warranted of
vocations.Hence I still accept friendly relations with Pepin, for he has much
private amiability, and though he probably thinks of me as a man of
slender talents, without rapidity of _coup d'oeil_ and with no
compensatory penetration, he meets me very cordially, and would not, I
am sure, willingly pain me in conversation by crudely declaring his low
estimate of my capacity.Yet I have often known him to insult my betters
and contribute (perhaps unreflectingly) to encourage injurious
conceptions of them--but that was done in the course of his professional
writing, and the public conscience still leaves such writing nearly on
the level of the Merry-Andrew's dress, which permits an impudent
deportment and extraordinary gambols to one who in his ordinary clothing
shows himself the decent father of a family.DISEASES OF SMALL AUTHORSHIP

Particular callings, it is known, encourage particular diseases.There
is a painter's colic: the Sheffield grinder falls a victim to the
inhalation of steel dust: clergymen so often have a certain kind of sore
throat that this otherwise secular ailment gets named after them.And
perhaps, if we were to inquire, we should find a similar relation
between certain moral ailments and these various occupations, though
here in the case of clergymen there would be specific differences: the
poor curate, equally with the rector, is liable to clergyman's sore
throat, but he would probably be found free from the chronic moral
ailments encouraged by the possession of glebe and those higher chances
of preferment which follow on having a good position already.On the
other hand, the poor curate might have severe attacks of calculating
expectancy concerning parishioners' turkeys, cheeses, and fat geese, or
of uneasy rivalry for the donations of clerical charities.Authors are so miscellaneous a class that
their personified diseases, physical and moral,
might include the whole procession of human
disorders, led by dyspepsia and ending in
madness--the awful Dumb Show of a world-historic
tragedy.Take a large enough area
of human life and all comedy melts into
tragedy, like the Fool's part by the side of
Lear.The chief scenes get filled with erring
heroes, guileful usurpers, persecuted discoverers,
dying deliverers: everywhere the
protagonist has a part pregnant with doom.The comedy sinks to an accessory, and if there
are loud laughs they seem a convulsive transition
from sobs; or if the comedy is touched
with a gentle lovingness, the panoramic scene
is one where

        "Sadness is a kind of mirth
  So mingled as if mirth did make us sad
  And sadness merry."[1]

[Footnote 1: Two Noble Kinsmen.]But I did not set out on the wide survey that would carry me into
tragedy, and in fact had nothing more serious in my mind than certain
small chronic ailments that come of small authorship.I was thinking
principally of Vorticella, who flourished in my youth not only as a
portly lady walking in silk attire, but also as the authoress of a book
entitled 'The Channel Islands, with Notes and an Appendix.'I would by
no means make it a reproach to her that she wrote no more than one book;
on the contrary, her stopping there seems to me a laudable example.What
one would have wished, after experience, was that she had refrained from
producing even that single volume, and thus from giving her
self-importance a troublesome kind of double incorporation which became
oppressive to her acquaintances, and set up in herself one of those
slight chronic forms of disease to which I have just referred.She lived
in the considerable provincial town of Pumpiter, which had its own
newspaper press, with the usual divisions of political partisanship and
the usual varieties of literary criticism--the florid and allusive, the
_staccato_ and peremptory, the clairvoyant and prophetic, the safe and
pattern-phrased, or what one might call "the many-a-long-day style."Vorticella being the wife of an important townsman had naturally the
satisfaction of seeing 'The Channel Islands' reviewed by all the organs
of Pumpiter opinion, and their articles or paragraphs held as naturally
the opening pages in the elegantly bound album prepared by her for the
reception of "critical opinions."This ornamental volume lay on a
special table in her drawing-room close to the still more gorgeously
bound work of which it was the significant effect, and every guest was
allowed the privilege of reading what had been said of the authoress and
her work in the 'Pumpiter Gazette and Literary Watchman,' the 'Pumpshire
Post,' the 'Church Clock,' the 'Independent Monitor,' and the lively but
judicious publication known as the 'Medley Pie;' to be followed up, if
he chose, by the instructive perusal of the strikingly confirmatory
judgments, sometimes concurrent in the very phrases, of journals from
the most distant counties; as the 'Latchgate Argus,' the Penllwy
Universe,' the 'Cockaleekie Advertiser,' the 'Goodwin Sands Opinion,'
and the 'Land's End Times.'I had friends in Pumpiter and occasionally paid a long visit there.When
I called on Vorticella, who had a cousinship with my hosts, she had to
excuse herself because a message claimed her attention for eight or ten
minutes, and handing me the album of critical opinions said, with a
certain emphasis which, considering my youth, was highly complimentary,
that she would really like me to read what I should find there.This
seemed a permissive politeness which I could not feel to be an
oppression, and I ran my eyes over the dozen pages, each with a strip or
islet of newspaper in the centre, with that freedom of mind (in my case
meaning freedom to forget) which would be a perilous way of preparing
for examination.This _ad libitum_ perusal had its interest for me.The
private truth being that I had not read 'The Channel Islands,' I was
amazed at the variety of matter which the volume must contain to have
impressed these different judges with the writer's surpassing capacity
to handle almost all branches of inquiry and all forms of presentation.In Jersey she had shown herself an historian, in Guernsey a poetess, in
Alderney a political economist, and in Sark a humorist: there were
sketches of character scattered through the pages which might put our
"fictionists" to the blush; the style was eloquent and racy, studded
with gems of felicitous remark; and the moral spirit throughout was so
superior that, said one, "the recording angel" (who is not supposed to
take account of literature as such) "would assuredly set down the work
as a deed of religion."The force of this eulogy on the part of several
reviewers was much heightened by the incidental evidence of their
fastidious and severe taste, which seemed to suffer considerably from
the imperfections of our chief writers, even the dead and canonised: one
afflicted them with the smell of oil, another lacked erudition and
attempted (though vainly) to dazzle them with trivial conceits, one
wanted to be more philosophical than nature had made him, another in
attempting to be comic produced the melancholy effect of a half-starved
Merry-Andrew; while one and all, from the author of the 'Areopagitica'
downwards, had faults of style which must have made an able hand in the
'Latchgate Argus' shake the many-glanced head belonging thereto with a
smile of compassionate disapproval.Not so the authoress of 'The Channel
Islands:' Vorticella and Shakspere were allowed to be faultless.I
gathered that no blemishes were observable in the work of this
accomplished writer, and the repeated information that she was "second
to none" seemed after this superfluous.Her thick octavo--notes,
appendix and all--was unflagging from beginning to end; and the 'Land's
End Times,' using a rather dangerous rhetorical figure, recommended you
not to take up the volume unless you had leisure to finish it at a
sitting.It had given one writer more pleasure than he had had for many
a long day--a sentence which had a melancholy resonance, suggesting a
life of studious languor such as all previous achievements of the human
mind failed to stimulate into enjoyment.I think the collection of
critical opinions wound up with this sentence, and I had turned back to
look at the lithographed sketch of the authoress which fronted the first
page of the album, when the fair original re-entered and I laid down the
volume on its appropriate table."Well, what do you think of them?"said Vorticella, with an emphasis
which had some significance unperceived by me."I know you are a great
student.Give me _your_ opinion of these opinions.""They must be very gratifying to you," I answered with a little
confusion, for I perceived that I might easily mistake my footing, and I
began to have a presentiment of an examination for which I was by no
means crammed."On the whole--yes," said Vorticella, in a tone of concession."A few of
the notices are written with some pains, but not one of them has really
grappled with the chief idea in the appendix.I don't know whether you
have studied political economy, but you saw what I said on page 398
about the Jersey fisheries?"I bowed--I confess it--with the mean hope that this movement in the nape
of my neck would be taken as sufficient proof that I had read, marked,
and learned.I do not forgive myself for this pantomimic falsehood, but
I was young and morally timorous, and Vorticella's personality had an
effect on me something like that of a powerful mesmeriser when he
directs all his ten fingers towards your eyes, as unpleasantly visible
ducts for the invisible stream.I felt a great power of contempt in her,
if I did not come up to her expectations."Well," she resumed, "you observe that not one of them has taken up that
argument.But I hope I convinced you about the drag-nets?"Orientally speaking, I had lifted up my foot
on the steep descent of falsity and was compelled to set it down on a
lower level."I should think you must be right," said I, inwardly
resolving that on the next topic I would tell the truth."I _know_ that I am right," said Vorticella."The fact is that no critic
in this town is fit to meddle with such subjects, unless it be Volvox,
and he, with all his command of language, is very superficial.It is
Volvox who writes in the 'Monitor,' I hope you noticed how he
contradicts himself?"My resolution, helped by the equivalence of dangers, stoutly prevailed,
and I said, "No."He is the only one who finds fault with me.He is
a Dissenter, you know.The 'Monitor' is the Dissenters' organ, but my
husband has been so useful to them in municipal affairs that they would
not venture to run my book down; they feel obliged to tell the truth
about me.After praising me for my
penetration and accuracy, he presently says I have allowed myself to be
imposed upon and have let my active imagination run away with me.That
is like his dissenting impertinence.Active my imagination may be, but I
have it under control.Little Vibrio, who writes the playful notice in
the 'Medley Pie,' has a clever hit at Volvox in that passage about the
steeplechase of imagination, where the loser wants to make it appear
that the winner was only run away with.But if you did not notice
Volvox's self-contradiction you would not see the point," added
Vorticella, with rather a chilling intonation."Or perhaps you did not
read the 'Medley Pie' notice?Vibrio is a poor little tippling creature, but, as Mr Carlyle would say,
he has an eye, and he is always lively."I did take up the book again, and read as demanded."It is very ingenious," said I, really appreciating the difficulty of
being lively in this connection: it seemed even more wonderful than that
a Vibrio should have an eye."You are probably surprised to see no notices from the London press,"
said Vorticella."I have one--a very remarkable one.But I reserve it
until the others have spoken, and then I shall introduce it to wind up.I shall have them reprinted, of course, and inserted in future copies.This from the 'Candelabrum' is only eight lines in length, but full of
venom.I think that will tell its
own tale, placed after the other critiques.""People's impressions are so different," said I."Some persons find 'Don
Quixote' dull.""Yes," said Vorticella, in emphatic chest tones, "dulness is a matter of
opinion; but pompous!Perhaps he
means that my matter is too important for his taste; and I have no
objection to _that_.I should just like
to read you that passage about the drag-nets, because I could make it
clearer to you."A second (less ornamental) copy was at her elbow and was already opened,
when to my great relief another guest was announced, and I was able to
take my leave without seeming to run away from 'The Channel Islands,'
though not without being compelled to carry with me the loan of "the
marked copy," which I was to find advantageous in a re-perusal of the
appendix, and was only requested to return before my departure from
Pumpiter.Looking into the volume now with some curiosity, I found it a
very ordinary combination of the commonplace and ambitious, one of those
books which one might imagine to have been written under the old Grub
Street coercion of hunger and thirst, if they were not known beforehand
to be the gratuitous productions of ladies and gentlemen whose
circumstances might be called altogether easy, but for an uneasy vanity
that happened to have been directed towards authorship.Its importance
was that of a polypus, tumour, fungus, or other erratic outgrowth,
noxious and disfiguring in its effect on the individual organism which
nourishes it.Poor Vorticella might not have been more wearisome on a
visit than the majority of her neighbours, but for this disease of
magnified self-importance belonging to small authorship.I understand
that the chronic complaint of 'The Channel Islands' never left her.As
the years went on and the publication tended to vanish in the distance
for her neighbours' memory, she was still bent on dragging it to the
foreground, and her chief interest in new acquaintances was the
possibility of lending them her book, entering into all details
concerning it, and requesting them to read her album of "critical
opinions."This really made her more tiresome than Gregarina, whose
distinction was that she had had cholera, and who did not feel herself
in her true position with strangers until they knew it.My experience with Vorticella led me for a time into the false
supposition that this sort of fungous disfiguration, which makes Self
disagreeably larger, was most common to the female sex; but I presently
found that here too the male could assert his superiority and show a
more vigorous boredom.I have known a man with a single pamphlet
containing an assurance that somebody else was wrong, together with a
few approved quotations, produce a more powerful effect of shuddering at
his approach than ever Vorticella did with her varied octavo volume,
including notes and appendix.Males of more than one nation recur to my
memory who produced from their pocket on the slightest encouragement a
small pink or buff duodecimo pamphlet, wrapped in silver paper, as a
present held ready for an intelligent reader."A mode of propagandism,"
you remark in excuse; "they wished to spread some useful corrective
doctrine."Not necessarily: the indoctrination aimed at was perhaps to
convince you of their own talents by the sample of an "Ode on
Shakspere's Birthday," or a translation from Horace.Vorticella may pair off with Monas, who had also written his one
book--'Here and There; or, a Trip from Truro to Transylvania'--and not
only carried it in his portmanteau when he went on visits, but took the
earliest opportunity of depositing it in the drawing-room, and
afterwards would enter to look for it, as if under pressure of a need
for reference, begging the lady of the house to tell him whether she,
had seen "a small volume bound in red."One hostess at last ordered it
to be carried into his bedroom to save his time; but it presently
reappeared in his hands, and was again left with inserted slips of paper
on the drawing-room table.Depend upon it, vanity is human, native alike to men and women; only in
the male it is of denser texture, less volatile, so that it less
immediately informs you of its presence, but is more massive and capable
of knocking you down if you come into collision with it; while in women
vanity lays by its small revenges as in a needle-case always at hand.The difference is in muscle and finger-tips, in traditional habits and
mental perspective, rather than in the original appetite of vanity.It
is an approved method now to explain ourselves by a reference to the
races as little like us as possible, which leads me to observe that in
Fiji the men use the most elaborate hair-dressing, and that wherever
tattooing is in vogue the male expects to carry off the prize of
admiration for pattern and workmanship.Arguing analogically, and
looking for this tendency of the Fijian or Hawaian male in the eminent
European, we must suppose that it exhibits itself under the forms of
civilised apparel; and it would be a great mistake to estimate
passionate effort by the effect it produces on our perception or
understanding.It is conceivable that a man may have concentrated no
less will and expectation on his wristbands, gaiters, and the shape of
his hat-brim, or an appearance which impresses you as that of the modern
"swell," than the Ojibbeway on an ornamentation which seems to us much
more elaborate.In what concerns the search for admiration at least, it
is not true that the effect is equal to the cause and resembles it.The
cause of a flat curl on the masculine forehead, such as might be seen
when George the Fourth was king, must have been widely different in
quality and intensity from the impression made by that small scroll of
hair on the organ of the beholder.Merely to maintain an attitude and
gait which I notice in certain club men, and especially an inflation of
the chest accompanying very small remarks, there goes, I am convinced,
an expenditure of psychical energy little appreciated by the
multitude--a mental vision of Self and deeply impressed beholders which
is quite without antitype in what we call the effect produced by that
hidden process.there is no need to admit that women would carry away the prize of
vanity in a competition where differences of custom were fairly
considered.A man cannot show his vanity in a tight skirt which forces
him to walk sideways down the staircase; but let the match be between
the respective vanities of largest beard and tightest skirt, and here
too the battle would be to the strong.It is a familiar example of irony in the degradation of words that "what
a man is worth" has come to mean how much money he possesses; but there
seems a deeper and more melancholy irony in the shrunken meaning that
popular or polite speech assigns to "morality" and "morals."The poor
part these words are made to play recalls the fate of those pagan
divinities who, after being understood to rule the powers of the air and
the destinies of men, came down to the level of insignificant demons, or
were even made a farcical show for the amusement of the multitude.Talking to Melissa in a time of commercial trouble, I found her disposed
to speak pathetically of the disgrace which had fallen on Sir Gavial
Mantrap, because of his conduct in relation to the Eocene Mines, and to
other companies ingeniously devised by him for the punishment of
ignorance in people of small means: a disgrace by which the poor titled
gentleman was actually reduced to live in comparative obscurity on his
wife's settlement of one or two hundred thousand in the consols."Surely your pity is misapplied," said I, rather dubiously, for I like
the comfort of trusting that a correct moral judgment is the strong
point in woman (seeing that she has a majority of about a million in our
islands), and I imagined that Melissa might have some unexpressed
grounds for her opinion."I should have thought you would rather be
sorry for Mantrap's victims--the widows, spinsters, and hard-working
fathers whom his unscrupulous haste to make himself rich has cheated of
all their savings, while he is eating well, lying softly, and after
impudently justifying himself before the public, is perhaps joining in
the General Confession with a sense that he is an acceptable object in
the sight of God, though decent men refuse to meet him.""Oh, all that about the Companies, I know, was most unfortunate.In
commerce people are led to do so many things, and he might not know
exactly how everything would turn out.But Sir Gavial made a good use of
his money, and he is a thoroughly _moral_ man.""What do you mean by a thoroughly moral man?""Oh, I suppose every one means the same by that," said Melissa, with a
slight air of rebuke."Sir Gavial is an excellent family man--quite
blameless there; and so charitable round his place at Tiptop.Very
different from Mr Barabbas, whose life, my husband tells me, is most
objectionable, with actresses and that sort of thing.I think a man's
morals should make a difference to us.I'm not sorry for Mr Barabbas,
but _I am_ sorry for Sir Gavial Mantrap."I will not repeat my answer to Melissa, for I fear it was offensively
brusque, my opinion being that Sir Gavial was the more pernicious
scoundrel of the two, since his name for virtue served as an effective
part of a swindling apparatus; and perhaps I hinted that to call such a
man moral showed rather a silly notion of human affairs.In fact, I had
an angry wish to be instructive, and Melissa, as will sometimes happen,
noticed my anger without appropriating my instruction, for I have since
heard that she speaks of me as rather violent-tempered, and not over
strict in my views of morality.I wish that this narrow use of words which are wanted in their full
meaning were confined to women like Melissa.Seeing that Morality and
Morals under their _alias_ of Ethics are the subject of voluminous
discussion, and their true basis a pressing matter of dispute--seeing
that the most famous book ever written on Ethics, and forming a chief
study in our colleges, allies ethical with political science or that
which treats of the constitution and prosperity of States, one might
expect that educated men would find reason to avoid a perversion of
language which lends itself to no wider view of life than that of
village gossips.Yet I find even respectable historians of our own and
of foreign countries, after showing that a king was treacherous,
rapacious, and ready to sanction gross breaches in the administration of
justice, end by praising him for his pure moral character, by which one
must suppose them to mean that he was not lewd nor debauched, not the
European twin of the typical Indian potentate whom Macaulay describes as
passing his life in chewing bang and fondling dancing-girls.And since
we are sometimes told of such maleficent kings that they were religious,
we arrive at the curious result that the most serious wide-reaching
duties of man lie quite outside both Morality and Religion--the one of
these consisting in not keeping mistresses (and perhaps not drinking too
much), and the other in certain ritual and spiritual transactions with
God which can be carried on equally well side by side with the basest
conduct towards men.With such a classification as this it is no wonder,
considering the strong reaction of language on thought, that many minds,
dizzy with indigestion of recent science and philosophy, are far to seek
for the grounds of social duty, and without entertaining any private
intention of committing a perjury which would ruin an innocent man, or
seeking gain by supplying bad preserved meats to our navy, feel
themselves speculatively obliged to inquire why they should not do so,
and are inclined to measure their intellectual subtlety by their
dissatisfaction with all answers to this "Why?"It is of little use to
theorise in ethics while our habitual phraseology stamps the larger part
of our social duties as something that lies aloof from the deepest needs
and affections of our nature.The informal definitions of popular
language are the only medium through which theory really affects the
mass of minds even among the nominally educated; and when a man whose
business hours, the solid part of every day, are spent in an
unscrupulous course of public or private action which has every
calculable chance of causing widespread injury and misery, can be called
moral because he comes home to dine with his wife and children and
cherishes the happiness of his own hearth, the augury is not good for
the use of high ethical and theological disputation.Not for one moment would one willingly lose sight of the truth that the
relation of the sexes and the primary ties of kinship are the deepest
roots of human wellbeing, but to make them by themselves the equivalent
of morality is verbally to cut off the channels of feeling through
which they are the feeders of that wellbeing.They are the original
fountains of a sensibility to the claims of others, which is the bond of
societies; but being necessarily in the first instance a private good,
there is always the danger that individual selfishness will see in them
only the best part of its own gain; just as knowledge, navigation,
commerce, and all the conditions which are of a nature to awaken men's
consciousness of their mutual dependence and to make the world one great
society, are the occasions of selfish, unfair action, of war and
oppression, so long as the public conscience or chief force of feeling
and opinion is not uniform and strong enough in its insistance on what
is demanded by the general welfare.And among the influences that must
<DW44> a right public judgment, the degradation of words which involve
praise and blame will be reckoned worth protesting against by every
mature observer.To rob words of half their meaning, while they retain
their dignity as qualifications, is like allowing to men who have lost
half their faculties the same high and perilous command which they won
in their time of vigour; or like selling food and seeds after
fraudulently abstracting their best virtues: in each case what ought to
be beneficently strong is fatally enfeebled, if not empoisoned.Until we
have altered our dictionaries and have found some other word than
_morality_ to stand in popular use for the duties of man to man, let us
refuse to accept as moral the contractor who enriches himself by using
large machinery to make pasteboard soles pass as leather for the feet of
unhappy conscripts fighting at miserable odds against invaders: let us
rather call him a miscreant, though he were the tenderest, most faithful
of husbands, and contend that his own experience of home happiness makes
his reckless infliction of suffering on others all the more atrocious.Let us refuse to accept as moral any political leader who should allow
his conduct in relation to great issues to be determined by egoistic
passion, and boldly say that he would be less immoral even though he
were as lax in his personal habits as Sir Robert Walpole, if at the same
time his sense of the public welfare were supreme in his mind, quelling
all pettier impulses beneath a magnanimous impartiality.And though we
were to find among that class of journalists who live by recklessly
reporting injurious rumours, insinuating the blackest motives in
opponents, descanting at large and with an air of infallibility on
dreams which they both find and interpret, and stimulating bad feeling
between nations by abusive writing which is as empty of real conviction
as the rage of a pantomime king, and would be ludicrous if its effects
did not make it appear diabolical--though we were to find among these a
man who was benignancy itself in his own circle, a healer of private
differences, a soother in private calamities, let us pronounce him
nevertheless flagrantly immoral, a root of hideous cancer in the
commonwealth, turning the channels of instruction into feeders of social
and political disease.In opposite ways one sees bad effects likely to be encouraged by this
narrow use of the word _morals_, shutting out from its meaning half
those actions of a man's life which tell momentously on the wellbeing of
his fellow-citizens, and on the preparation of a future for the children
growing up around him.Thoroughness of workmanship, care in the
execution of every task undertaken, as if it were the acceptance of a
trust which it would be a breach of faith not to discharge well, is a
form of duty so momentous that if it were to die out from the feeling
and practice of a people, all reforms of institutions would be helpless
to create national prosperity and national happiness.Do we desire to
see public spirit penetrating all classes of the community and affecting
every man's conduct, so that he shall make neither the saving of his
soul nor any other private saving an excuse for indifference to the
general welfare?But the sort of public spirit that
scamps its bread-winning work, whether with the trowel, the pen, or the
overseeing brain, that it may hurry to scenes of political or social
agitation, would be as baleful a gift to our people as any malignant
demon could devise.One best part of educational training is that which
comes through special knowledge and manipulative or other skill, with
its usual accompaniment of delight, in relation to work which is the
daily bread-winning occupation--which is a man's contribution to the
effective wealth of society in return for what he takes as his own
share.But this duty of doing one's proper work well, and taking care
that every product of one's labour shall be genuinely what it pretends
to be, is not only left out of morals in popular speech, it is very
little insisted on by public teachers, at least in the only effective
way--by tracing the continuous effects of ill-done work.Some of them
seem to be still hopeful that it will follow as a necessary consequence
from week-day services, ecclesiastical decoration, and improved
hymn-books; others apparently trust to descanting on self-culture in
general, or to raising a general sense of faulty circumstances; and
meanwhile lax, make-shift work, from the high conspicuous kind to the
average and obscure, is allowed to pass unstamped with the disgrace of
immorality, though there is not a member of society who is not daily
suffering from it materially and spiritually, and though it is the fatal
cause that must degrade our national rank and our commerce in spite of
all open markets and discovery of available coal-seams.I suppose one may take the popular misuse of the words Morality and
Morals as some excuse for certain absurdities which are occasional
fashions in speech and writing--certain old lay-figures, as ugly as the
queerest Asiatic idol, which at different periods get propped into
loftiness, and attired in magnificent Venetian drapery, so that whether
they have a human face or not is of little consequence.One is, the
notion that there is a radical, irreconcilable opposition between
intellect and morality.I do not mean the simple statement of fact,
which everybody knows, that remarkably able men have had very faulty
morals, and have outraged public feeling even at its ordinary standard;
but the supposition that the ablest intellect, the highest genius, will
see through morality as a sort of twaddle for bibs and tuckers, a
doctrine of dulness, a mere incident in human stupidity.We begin to
understand the acceptance of this foolishness by considering that we
live in a society where we may hear a treacherous monarch, or a
malignant and lying politician, or a man who uses either official or
literary power as an instrument of his private partiality or hatred, or
a manufacturer who devises the falsification of wares, or a trader who
deals in virtueless seed-grains, praised or compassionated because of
his excellent morals.Clearly if morality meant no more than such decencies as are practised
by these poisonous members of society, it would be possible to say,
without suspicion of light-headedness, that morality lay aloof from the
grand stream of human affairs, as a small channel fed by the stream and
not missed from it.While this form of nonsense is conveyed in the
popular use of words, there must be plenty of well-dressed ignorance at
leisure to run through a box of books, which will feel itself initiated
in the freemasonry of intellect by a view of life which might take for a
Shaksperian motto--

  "Fair is foul and foul is fair,
  Hover through the fog and filthy air"--

and will find itself easily provided with striking conversation by the
rule of reversing all the judgments on good and evil which have come to
be the calendar and clock-work of society.But let our habitual talk
give morals their full meaning as the conduct which, in every human
relation, would follow from the fullest knowledge and the fullest
sympathy--a meaning perpetually corrected and enriched by a more
thorough appreciation of dependence in things, and a finer sensibility
to both physical and spiritual fact--and this ridiculous ascription of
superlative power to minds which have no effective awe-inspiring vision
of the human lot, no response of understanding to the connection between
duty and the material processes by which the world is kept habitable for
cultivated man, will be tacitly discredited without any need to cite the
immortal names that all are obliged to take as the measure of
intellectual rank and highly-charged genius.Suppose a Frenchman--I mean no disrespect to the great French nation,
for all nations are afflicted with their peculiar parasitic growths,
which are lazy, hungry forms, usually characterised by a
disproportionate swallowing apparatus: suppose a Parisian who should
shuffle down the Boulevard with a soul ignorant of the gravest cares and
the deepest tenderness of manhood, and a frame more or less fevered by
debauchery, mentally polishing into utmost refinement of phrase and
rhythm verses which were an enlargement on that Shaksperian motto, and
worthy of the most expensive title to be furnished by the vendors of
such antithetic ware as _Les_ _marguerites de l'Enfer_, or _Les delices
de Beelzebuth_.This supposed personage might probably enough regard his
negation of those moral sensibilities which make half the warp and woof
of human history, his indifference to the hard thinking and hard
handiwork of life, to which he owed even his own gauzy mental garments
with their spangles of poor paradox, as the royalty of genius, for we
are used to witness such self-crowning in many forms of mental
alienation; but he would not, I think, be taken, even by his own
generation, as a living proof that there can exist such a combination as
that of moral stupidity and trivial emphasis of personal indulgence with
the large yet finely discriminating vision which marks the intellectual
masters of our kind.Doubtless there are many sorts of transfiguration,
and a man who has come to be worthy of all gratitude and reverence may
have had his swinish period, wallowing in ugly places; but suppose it
had been handed down to us that Sophocles or Virgil had at one time made
himself scandalous in this way: the works which have consecrated their
memory for our admiration and gratitude are not a glorifying of
swinishness, but an artistic incorporation of the highest sentiment
known to their age.All these may seem to be wide reasons for objecting to Melissa's pity
for Sir Gavial Mantrap on the ground of his good morals; but their
connection will not be obscure to any one who has taken pains to observe
the links uniting the scattered signs of our social development.SHADOWS OF THE COMING RACE.My friend Trost, who is no optimist as to the state of the universe
hitherto, but is confident that at some future period within the
duration of the solar system, ours will be the best of all possible
worlds--a hope which I always honour as a sign of beneficent
qualities--my friend Trost always tries to keep up my spirits under the
sight of the extremely unpleasant and disfiguring work by which many of
our fellow-creatures have to get their bread, with the assurance that
"all this will soon be done by machinery."But he sometimes neutralises
the consolation by extending it over so large an area of human labour,
and insisting so impressively on the quantity of energy which will thus
be set free for loftier purposes, that I am tempted to desire an
occasional famine of invention in the coming ages, lest the humbler
kinds of work should be entirely nullified while there are still left
some men and women who are not fit for the highest.Especially, when one considers the perfunctory way in which some of the
most exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to
be educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race
evolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of
work.When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine
for testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus
that, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in
turn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and
dismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of
micrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with
the invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires
and wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my
quickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing
the right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into
an automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects
the cadence of the fly's foot on the ceiling, and may be expected
presently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they
soliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for
these things, I get a little out of it, like an unfortunate savage too
suddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim--

"Am I already in the shadow of the Coming Race?and will the creatures
who are to transcend and finally supersede us be steely organisms,
giving out the effluvia of the laboratory, and performing with
infallible exactness more than everything that we have performed with a
slovenly approximativeness and self-defeating inaccuracy?""But," says Trost, treating me with cautious mildness on hearing me vent
this raving notion, "you forget that these wonder-workers are the slaves
of our race, need our tendance and regulation, obey the mandates of our
consciousness, and are only deaf and dumb bringers of reports which we
decipher and make use of.They are simply extensions of the human
organism, so to speak, limbs immeasurably more powerful, ever more
subtle finger-tips, ever more mastery over the invisibly great and the
invisibly small.Each new machine needs a new appliance of human skill
to construct it, new devices to feed it with material, and often
keener-edged faculties to note its registrations or performances.How
then can machines supersede us?--they depend upon us."I am not so sure of that," said I, getting back into my mind, and
becoming rather wilful in consequence."If, as I have heard you contend,
machines as they are more and more perfected will require less and less
of tendance, how do I know that they may not be ultimately made to
carry, or may not in themselves evolve, conditions of self-supply,
self-repair, and reproduction, and not only do all the mighty and subtle
work possible on this planet better than we could do it, but with the
immense advantage of banishing from the earth's atmosphere screaming
consciousnesses which, in our comparatively clumsy race, make an
intolerable noise and fuss to each other about every petty ant-like
performance, looking on at all work only as it were to spring a rattle
here or blow a trumpet there, with a ridiculous sense of being
effective?I for my part cannot see any reason why a sufficiently
penetrating thinker, who can see his way through a thousand years or so,
should not conceive a parliament of machines, in which the manners were
excellent and the motions infallible in logic: one honourable
instrument, a remote descendant of the Voltaic family, might discharge a
powerful current (entirely without animosity) on an honourable
instrument opposite, of more upstart origin, but belonging to the
ancient edge-tool race which we already at Sheffield see paring thick
iron as if it were mellow cheese--by this unerringly directed discharge
operating on movements corresponding to what we call Estimates, and by
necessary mechanical consequence on movements corresponding to what we
call the Funds, which with a vain analogy we sometimes speak of as
"sensitive."For every machine would be perfectly educated, that is to
say, would have the suitable molecular adjustments, which would act not
the less infallibly for being free from the fussy accompaniment of that
consciousness to which our prejudice gives a supreme governing rank,
when in truth it is an idle parasite on the grand sequence of things."returned Trost, getting angry, and judging it
kind to treat me with some severity; "what you have heard me say is,
that our race will and must act as a nervous centre to the utmost
development of mechanical processes: the subtly refined powers of
machines will react in producing more subtly refined thinking processes
which will occupy the minds set free from grosser labour.Say, for
example, that all the scavengers work of London were done, so far as
human attention is concerned, by the occasional pressure of a brass
button (as in the ringing of an electric bell), you will then have a
multitude of brains set free for the exquisite enjoyment of dealing with
the exact sequences and high speculations supplied and prompted by the
delicate machines which yield a response to the fixed stars, and give
readings of the spiral vortices fundamentally concerned in the
production of epic poems or great judicial harangues.So far from
mankind being thrown out of work according to your notion," concluded
Trost, with a peculiar nasal note of scorn, "if it were not for your
incurable dilettanteism in science as in all other things--if you had
once understood the action of any delicate machine--you would perceive
that the sequences it carries throughout the realm of phenomena would
require many generations, perhaps aeons, of understandings considerably
stronger than yours, to exhaust the store of work it lays open.""Precisely," said I, with a meekness which I felt was praiseworthy; "it
is the feebleness of my capacity, bringing me nearer than you to the
human average, that perhaps enables me to imagine certain results better
than you can.Doubtless the very fishes of our rivers, gullible as they
look, and slow as they are to be rightly convinced in another order of
facts, form fewer false expectations about each other than we should
form about them if we were in a position of somewhat fuller intercourse
with their species; for even as it is we have continually to be
surprised that they do not rise to our carefully selected bait.Take me
then as a sort of reflective and experienced carp; but do not estimate
the justice of my ideas by my facial expression."says Trost (We are on very intimate terms.)"Naturally," I persisted, "it is less easy to you than to me to imagine
our race transcended and superseded, since the more energy a being is
possessed of, the harder it must be for him to conceive his own death.But I, from the point of view of a reflective carp, can easily imagine
myself and my congeners dispensed with in the frame of things and giving
way not only to a superior but a vastly different kind of Entity.What I
would ask you is, to show me why, since each new invention casts a new
light along the pathway of discovery, and each new combination or
structure brings into play more conditions than its inventor foresaw,
there should not at length be a machine of such high mechanical and
chemical powers that it would find and assimilate the material to supply
its own waste, and then by a further evolution of internal molecular
movements reproduce itself by some process of fission or budding.This
last stage having been reached, either by man's contrivance or as an
unforeseen result, one sees that the process of natural selection must
drive men altogether out of the field; for they will long before have
begun to sink into the miserable condition of those unhappy characters
in fable who, having demons or djinns at their beck, and being obliged
to supply them with work, found too much of everything done in too short
a time.What demons so potent as molecular movements, none the less
tremendously potent for not carrying the futile cargo of a consciousness
screeching irrelevantly, like a fowl tied head downmost to the saddle of
a swift horseman?Under such uncomfortable circumstances our race will
have diminished with the diminishing call on their energies, and by the
time that the self-repairing and reproducing machines arise, all but a
few of the rare inventors, calculators, and speculators will have become
pale, pulpy, and cretinous from fatty or other degeneration, and behold
around them a scanty hydrocephalous offspring.As to the breed of the
ingenious and intellectual, their nervous systems will at last have been
overwrought in following the molecular revelations of the immensely
more powerful unconscious race, and they will naturally, as the less
energetic combinations of movement, subside like the flame of a candle
in the sunlight Thus the feebler race, whose corporeal adjustments
happened to be accompanied with a maniacal consciousness which imagined
itself moving its mover, will have vanished, as all less adapted
existences do before the fittest--i.e., the existence composed of the
most persistent groups of movements and the most capable of
incorporating new groups in harmonious relation.Who--if our
consciousness is, as I have been given to understand, a mere stumbling
of our organisms on their way to unconscious perfection--who shall say
that those fittest existences will not be found along the track of what
we call inorganic combinations, which will carry on the most elaborate
processes as mutely and painlessly as we are now told that the minerals
are metamorphosing themselves continually in the dark laboratory of the
earth's crust?Thus this planet may be filled with beings who will be
blind and deaf as the inmost rock, yet will execute changes as delicate
and complicated as those of human language and all the intricate web of
what we call its effects, without sensitive impression, without
sensitive impulse: there may be, let us say, mute orations, mute
rhapsodies, mute discussions, and no consciousness there even to enjoy
the silence.""The supposition is logical," said I."It is well argued from the
premises."cried Trost, turning on me with some fierceness."You
don't mean to call them mine, I hope."They seem to be flying about in the air with other
germs, and have found a sort of nidus among my melancholy fancies.They bear the same relation to real belief as
walking on the head for a show does to running away from an explosion or
walking fast to catch the train."To discern likeness amidst diversity, it is well known, does not require
so fine a mental edge as the discerning of diversity amidst general
sameness.The primary rough classification depends on the prominent
resemblances of things: the progress is towards finer and finer
discrimination according to minute differences.Yet even at this stage
of European culture one's attention is continually drawn to the
prevalence of that grosser mental sloth which makes people dull to the
most ordinary prompting of comparison--the bringing things together
because of their likeness.The same motives, the same ideas, the same
practices, are alternately admired and abhorred, lauded and denounced,
according to their association with superficial differences, historical
or actually social: even learned writers treating of great subjects
often show an attitude of mind not greatly superior in its logic to that
of the frivolous fine lady who is indignant at the frivolity of her
maid.To take only the subject of the Jews: it would be difficult to find a
form of bad reasoning about them which has not been heard in
conversation or been admitted to the dignity of print; but the neglect
of resemblances is a common property of dulness which unites all the
various points of view--the prejudiced, the puerile, the spiteful, and
the abysmally ignorant.That the preservation of national memories is an element and a means of
national greatness, that their revival is a sign of reviving
nationality, that every heroic defender, every patriotic restorer, has
been inspired by such memories and has made them his watchword, that
even such a corporate existence as that of a Roman legion or an English
regiment has been made valorous by memorial standards,--these are the
glorious commonplaces of historic teaching at our public schools and
universities, being happily ingrained in Greek and Latin classics.They
have also been impressed on the world by conspicuous modern instances.That there is a free modern Greece is due--through all infiltration of
other than Greek blood--to the presence of ancient Greece in the
consciousness of European men; and every speaker would feel his point
safe if he were to praise Byron's devotion to a cause made glorious by
ideal identification with the past; hardly so, if he were to insist that
the Greeks were not to be helped further because their history shows
that they were anciently unsurpassed in treachery and lying, and that
many modern Greeks are highly disreputable characters, while others are
disposed to grasp too large a share of our commerce.The same with
Italy: the pathos of his country's lot pierced the youthful soul of
Mazzini, because, like Dante's, his blood was fraught with the kinship
of Italian greatness, his imagination filled with a majestic past that
wrought itself into a majestic future.Half a century ago, what was
Italy?An idling-place of dilettanteism or of itinerant motiveless
wealth, a territory parcelled out for papal sustenance, dynastic
convenience, and the profit of an alien Government.No people, no voice in European counsels, no massive power in
European affairs: a race thought of in English and French society as
chiefly adapted to the operatic stage, or to serve as models for
painters; disposed to smile gratefully at the reception of halfpence;
and by the more historical remembered to be rather polite than truthful,
in all probability a combination of Machiavelli, Rubini, and Masaniello.Thanks chiefly to the divine gift of a memory which inspires the moments
with a past, a present, and a future, and gives the sense of corporate
existence that raises man above the otherwise more respectable and
innocent brute, all that, or most of it, is changed.Again, one of our living historians finds just sympathy in his vigorous
insistance on our true ancestry, on our being the strongly marked
heritors in language and genius of those old English seamen who,
beholding a rich country with a most convenient seaboard, came,
doubtless with a sense of divine warrant, and settled themselves on this
or the other side of fertilising streams, gradually conquering more and
more of the pleasant land from the natives who knew nothing of Odin,
and finally making unusually clean work in ridding themselves of those
prior occupants."Let us," he virtually says, "let us know who were our
forefathers, who it was that won the soil for us, and brought the good
seed of those institutions through which we should not arrogantly but
gratefully feel ourselves distinguished among the nations as possessors
of long-inherited freedom; let us not keep up an ignorant kind of naming
which disguises our true affinities of blood and language, but let us
see thoroughly what sort of notions and traditions our forefathers had,
and what sort of song inspired them.Let the poetic fragments which
breathe forth their fierce bravery in battle and their trust in fierce
gods who helped them, be treasured with affectionate reverence.These
seafaring, invading, self-asserting men were the English of old time,
and were our fathers who did rough work by which we are profiting.They
had virtues which incorporated themselves in wholesome usages to which
we trace our own political blessings.Let us know and acknowledge our
common relationship to them, and be thankful that over and above the
affections and duties which spring from our manhood, we have the closer
and more constantly guiding duties which belong to us as Englishmen."To this view of our nationality most persons who have feeling and
understanding enough to be conscious of the connection between the
patriotic affection and every other affection which lifts us above
emigrating rats and free-loving baboons, will be disposed to say Amen.True, we are not indebted to those ancestors for our religion: we are
rather proud of having got that illumination from elsewhere.The men who
planted our nation were not Christians, though they began their work
centuries after Christ; and they had a decided objection to Christianity
when it was first proposed to them: they were not monotheists, and their
religion was the reverse of spiritual.But since we have been fortunate
enough to keep the island-home they won for us, and have been on the
whole a prosperous people, rather continuing the plan of invading and
spoiling other lands than being forced to beg for shelter in them,
nobody has reproached us because our fathers thirteen hundred years ago
worshipped Odin, massacred Britons, and were with difficulty persuaded
to accept Christianity, knowing nothing of Hebrew history and the
reasons why Christ should be received as the Saviour of mankind.The Red
Indians, not liking us when we settled among them, might have been
willing to fling such facts in our faces, but they were too ignorant,
and besides, their opinions did not signify, because we were able, if we
liked, to exterminate them.The Hindoos also have doubtless had their
rancours against us and still entertain enough ill-will to make
unfavourable remarks on our character, especially as to our historic
rapacity and arrogant notions of our own superiority; they perhaps do
not admire the usual English profile, and they are not converted to our
way of feeding: but though we are a small number of an alien race
profiting by the territory and produce of these prejudiced people, they
are unable to turn us out; at least, when they tried we showed them
their mistake.We do not call ourselves a dispersed and a punished
people: we are a colonising people, and it is we who have punished
others.Still the historian guides us rightly in urging us to dwell on the
virtues of our ancestors with emulation, and to cherish our sense of a
common descent as a bond of obligation.The eminence, the nobleness of a
people depends on its capability of being stirred by memories, and of
striving for what we call spiritual ends--ends which consist not in
immediate material possession, but in the satisfaction of a great
feeling that animates the collective body as with one soul.A people
having the seed of worthiness in it must feel an answering thrill when
it is adjured by the deaths of its heroes who died to preserve its
national existence; when it is reminded of its small beginnings and
gradual growth through past labours and struggles, such as are still
demanded of it in order that the freedom and wellbeing thus inherited
may be transmitted unimpaired to children and children's children; when
an appeal against the permission of injustice is made to great
precedents in its history and to the better genius breathing in its
institutions.It is this living force of sentiment in common which makes
a national consciousness.Nations so moved will resist conquest with
the very breasts of their women, will pay their millions and their blood
to abolish slavery, will share privation in famine and all calamity,
will produce poets to sing "some great story of a man," and thinkers
whose theories will bear the test of action.An individual man, to be
harmoniously great, must belong to a nation of this order, if not in
actual existence yet existing in the past, in memory, as a departed,
invisible, beloved ideal, once a reality, and perhaps to be restored.A
common humanity is not yet enough to feed the rich blood of various
activity which makes a complete man.The time is not come for
cosmopolitanism to be highly virtuous, any more than for communism to
suffice for social energy.I am not bound to feel for a Chinaman as I
feel for my fellow-countryman: I am bound not to demoralise him with
opium, not to compel him to my will by destroying or plundering the
fruits of his labour on the alleged ground that he is not cosmopolitan
enough, and not to insult him for his want of my tailoring and religion
when he appears as a peaceable visitor on the London pavement.It is
admirable in a Briton with a good purpose to learn Chinese, but it
would not be a proof of fine intellect in him to taste Chinese poetry in
the original more than he tastes the poetry of his own tongue.Affection, intelligence, duty, radiate from a centre, and nature has
decided that for us English folk that centre can be neither China nor
Peru.Most of us feel this unreflectingly; for the affectation of
undervaluing everything native, and being too fine for one's own
country, belongs only to a few minds of no dangerous leverage.What is
wanting is, that we should recognise a corresponding attachment to
nationality as legitimate in every other people, and understand that its
absence is a privation of the greatest good.For, to repeat, not only the nobleness of a nation depends on the
presence of this national consciousness, but also the nobleness of each
individual citizen.Our dignity and rectitude are proportioned to our
sense of relationship with something great, admirable, pregnant with
high possibilities, worthy of sacrifice, a continual inspiration to
self-repression and discipline by the presentation of aims larger and
more attractive to our generous part than the securing of personal ease
or prosperity.And a people possessing this good should surely feel not
only a ready sympathy with the effort of those who, having lost the
good, strive to regain it, but a profound pity for any degradation
resulting from its loss; nay, something more than pity when happier
nationalities have made victims of the unfortunate whose memories
nevertheless are the very fountain to which the persecutors trace their
most vaunted blessings.These notions are familiar: few will deny them in the abstract, and many
are found loudly asserting them in relation to this or the other
particular case.But here as elsewhere, in the ardent application of
ideas, there is a notable lack of simple comparison or sensibility to
resemblance.The European world has long been used to consider the Jews
as altogether exceptional, and it has followed naturally enough that
they have been excepted from the rules of justice and mercy, which are
based on human likeness.But to consider a people whose ideas have
determined the religion of half the world, and that the more cultivated
half, and who made the most eminent struggle against the power of Rome,
as a purely exceptional race, is a demoralising offence against rational
knowledge, a stultifying inconsistency in historical interpretation.Every nation of forcible character--i.e., of strongly marked
characteristics, is so far exceptional.The distinctive note of each
bird-species is in this sense exceptional, but the necessary ground of
such distinction is a deeper likeness.The superlative peculiarity in
the Jews admitted, our affinity with them is only the more apparent when
the elements of their peculiarity are discerned.From whatever point of view the writings of the Old Testament may be
regarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high
interest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much
affected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the
New Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity.Whether
we accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part
of an ancient literature, makes no difference to the fact that we find
there the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from
an earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its
intensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify
faithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and
religious blessings.Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the
return under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against
Rome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which
rescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting
sway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials,
and stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain
and develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for,
by internal measures of legal administration and public teaching.Thenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as
they had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful
prophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of
preserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion
with that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and
often obscene.There was always a Foreign party reviling the National
party as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in
extensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a
foreign power.Such internal conflict naturally tightened the bands of
conservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred
ark, the vital spirit of a small nation--"the smallest of the
nations"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents;
and when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into
dread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose
chief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the
submergence of their nationality.Much might be said on this point
towards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which
is regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless
insurrection against an established native government; and for my part
(if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots.I
take the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and
preferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of
Caligula's deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of
steadfastness.But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of
that national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which
created in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence,
unique in its intensity.But not, before the dispersion, unique in essential qualities.There is
more likeness than contrast between the way we English got our island
and the way the Israelites got Canaan.We have not been noted for
forming a low estimate of ourselves in comparison with foreigners, or
for admitting that our institutions are equalled by those of any other
people under the sun.Many of us have thought that our sea-wall is a
specially divine arrangement to make and keep us a nation of sea-kings
after the manner of our forefathers, secure against invasion and able to
invade other lands when we need them, though they may lie on the other
side of the ocean.Again, it has been held that we have a peculiar
destiny as a Protestant people, not only able to bruise the head of an
idolatrous Christianity in the midst of us, but fitted as possessors of
the most truth and the most tonnage to carry our purer religion over the
world and convert mankind to our way of thinking.The Puritans,
asserting their liberty to restrain tyrants, found the Hebrew history
closely symbolical of their feelings and purpose; and it can hardly be
correct to cast the blame of their less laudable doings on the writings
they invoked, since their opponents made use of the same writings for
different ends, finding there a strong warrant for the divine right of
kings and the denunciation of those who, like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
took on themselves the office of the priesthood which belonged of right
solely to Aaron and his sons, or, in other words, to men ordained by the
English bishops.We must rather refer the passionate use of the Hebrew
writings to affinities of disposition between our own race and the
Jewish.Is it true that the arrogance of a Jew was so immeasurably
beyond that of a Calvinist?And the just sympathy and admiration which
we give to the ancestors who resisted the oppressive acts of our native
kings, and by resisting rescued or won for us the best part of our civil
and religious liberties--is it justly to be withheld from those brave
and steadfast men of Jewish race who fought and died, or strove by wise
administration to resist, the oppression and corrupting influences of
foreign tyrants, and by resisting rescued the nationality which was the
very hearth of our own religion?At any rate, seeing that the Jews were
more specifically than any other nation educated into a sense of their
supreme moral value, the chief matter of surprise is that any other
nation is found to rival them in this form of self-confidence.More exceptional--less like the course of our own history--has been
their dispersion and their subsistence as a separate people through ages
in which for the most part they were regarded and treated very much as
beasts hunted for the sake of their skins, or of a valuable secretion
peculiar to their species.The Jews showed a talent for accumulating
what was an object of more immediate desire to Christians than animal
oils or well-furred skins, and their cupidity and avarice were found at
once particularly hateful and particularly useful: hateful when seen as
a reason for punishing them by mulcting or robbery, useful when this
retributive process could be successfully carried forward.Kings and
emperors naturally were more alive to the usefulness of subjects who
could gather and yield money; but edicts issued to protect "the King's
Jews" equally with the King's game from being harassed and hunted by the
commonalty were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race
held to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the
Crusades began.As the slave-holders in the United States counted the
curse on Ham a justification of <DW64> slavery, so the curse on the Jews
was counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture
and handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable figures by a peculiar
dress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for
more gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as
certain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took
pains to spread the plague; for putting it to them whether they would be
baptised or burned, and not failing to burn and massacre them when they
were obstinate; but also for suspecting them of disliking the baptism
when they had got it, and then burning them in punishment of their
insincerity; finally, for hounding them by tens on tens of thousands
from the homes where they had found shelter for centuries, and
inflicting on them the horrors of a new exile and a new dispersion.All
this to avenge the Saviour of mankind, or else to compel these
stiff-necked people to acknowledge a Master whose servants showed such
beneficent effects of His teaching.With a people so treated one of two issues was possible: either from
being of feebler nature than their persecutors, and caring more for ease
than for the sentiments and ideas which constituted their distinctive
character, they would everywhere give way to pressure and get rapidly
merged in the populations around them; or, being endowed with uncommon
tenacity, physical and mental, feeling peculiarly the ties of
inheritance both in blood and faith, remembering national glories,
trusting in their recovery, abhorring apostasy, able to bear all things
and hope all things with the consciousness of being steadfast to
spiritual obligations, the kernel of their number would harden into an
inflexibility more and more insured by motive and habit.They would
cherish all differences that marked them off from their hated
oppressors, all memories that consoled them with a sense of virtual
though unrecognised superiority; and the separateness which was made
their badge of ignominy would be their inward pride, their source of
fortifying defiance.Doubtless such a people would get confirmed in
vices.An oppressive government and a persecuting religion, while
breeding vices in those who hold power, are well known to breed
answering vices in those who are powerless and suffering.What more
direct plan than the course presented by European history could have
been pursued in order to give the Jews a spirit of bitter isolation, of
scorn for the wolfish hypocrisy that made victims of them, of triumph in
prospering at the expense of the blunderers who stoned them away from
the open paths of industry?--or, on the other hand, to encourage in the
less defiant a lying conformity, a pretence of conversion for the sake
of the social advantages attached to baptism, an outward renunciation of
their hereditary ties with the lack of real love towards the society
and creed which exacted this galling tribute?--or again, in the most
unhappy specimens of the race, to rear transcendent examples of odious
vice, reckless instruments of rich men with bad propensities,
unscrupulous grinders of the alien people who wanted to grind _them_?No wonder the Jews have their vices: no wonder if it were proved (which
it has not hitherto appeared to be) that some of them have a bad
pre-eminence in evil, an unrivalled superfluity of naughtiness.It would
be more plausible to make a wonder of the virtues which have prospered
among them under the shadow of oppression.But instead of dwelling on
these, or treating as admitted what any hardy or ignorant person may
deny, let us found simply on the loud assertions of the hostile.The
Jews, it is said, resisted the expansion of their own religion into
Christianity; they were in the habit of spitting on the cross; they have
held the name of Christ to be _Anathema_.The men
who made Christianity a curse to them: the men who made the name of
Christ a symbol for the spirit of vengeance, and, what was worse, made
the execution of the vengeance a pretext for satisfying their own
savageness, greed, and envy: the men who sanctioned with the name of
Christ a barbaric and blundering copy of pagan fatalism in taking the
words "His blood be upon us and on our children" as a divinely appointed
verbal warrant for wreaking cruelty from generation to generation on the
people from whose sacred writings Christ drew His teaching.Strange
retrogression in the professors of an expanded religion, boasting an
illumination beyond the spiritual doctrine of Hebrew prophets!For
Hebrew prophets proclaimed a God who demanded mercy rather than
sacrifices.The Christians also believed that God delighted not in the
blood of rams and of bulls, but they apparently conceived Him as
requiring for His satisfaction the sighs and groans, the blood and
roasted flesh of men whose forefathers had misunderstood the
metaphorical character of prophecies which spoke of spiritual
pre-eminence under the figure of a material kingdom.Was this the method
by which Christ desired His title to the Messiahship to be commended to
the hearts and understandings of the nation in which He was born?Many
of His sayings bear the stamp of that patriotism which places
fellow-countrymen in the inner circle of affection and duty.And did the
words "Father, forgive them, they know not what they do," refer only to
the centurion and his band, a tacit exception being made of every Hebrew
there present from the mercy of the Father and the compassion of the
Son?--nay, more, of every Hebrew yet to come who remained unconverted
after hearing of His claim to the Messiahship, not from His own lips or
those of His native apostles, but from the lips of alien men whom cross,
creed, and baptism had left cruel, rapacious, and debauched?It is more
reverent to Christ to believe that He must have approved the Jewish
martyrs who deliberately chose to be burned or massacred rather than be
guilty of a blaspheming lie, more than He approved the rabble of
crusaders who robbed and murdered them in His name.But these
remonstrances seem to have no direct application to personages who take
up the attitude of philosophic thinkers and discriminating critics,
professedly accepting Christianity from a rational point of view as a
vehicle of the highest religious and moral truth, and condemning the
Jews on the ground that they are obstinate adherents of an outworn
creed, maintain themselves in moral alienation from the peoples with
whom they share citizenship, and are destitute of real interest in the
welfare of the community and state with which they are thus identified.These anti-Judaic advocates usually belong to a party which has felt
itself glorified in winning for Jews, as well as Dissenters and
Catholics, the full privileges of citizenship, laying open to them every
path to distinction.At one time the voice of this party urged that
differences of creed were made dangerous only by the denial of
citizenship--that you must make a man a citizen before he could feel
like one.At present, apparently, this confidence has been succeeded by
a sense of mistake: there is a regret that no limiting clauses were
insisted on, such as would have hindered the Jews from coming too far
and in too large proportion along those opened pathways; and the
Roumanians are thought to have shown an enviable wisdom in giving them
as little chance as possible.But then, the reflection occurring that
some of the most objectionable Jews are baptised Christians, it is
obvious that such clauses would have been insufficient, and the doctrine
that you can turn a Jew into a good Christian is emphatically retracted.But clearly, these liberal gentlemen, too late enlightened by
disagreeable events, must yield the palm of wise foresight to those who
argued against them long ago; and it is a striking spectacle to witness
minds so panting for advancement in some directions that they are ready
to force it on an unwilling society, in this instance despairingly
recurring to mediaeval types of thinking--insisting that the Jews are
made viciously cosmopolitan by holding the world's money-bag, that for
them all national interests are resolved into the algebra of loans, that
they have suffered an inward degradation stamping them as morally
inferior, and--"serve them right," since they rejected Christianity.All
which is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a
servile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been
repeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose
place in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the
clause, "No Irish need apply," parallels the sentence which for many
polite persons sums up the question of Judaism--"I never _did_ like the
Jews."It is certainly worth considering whether an expatriated, denationalised
race, used for ages to live among antipathetic populations, must not
inevitably lack some conditions of nobleness.If they drop that
separateness which is made their reproach, they may be in danger of
lapsing into a cosmopolitan indifference equivalent to cynicism, and of
missing that inward identification with the nationality immediately
around them which might make some amends for their inherited privation.No dispassionate observer can deny this danger.Why, our own countrymen
who take to living abroad without purpose or function to keep up their
sense of fellowship in the affairs of their own land are rarely good
specimens of moral healthiness; still, the consciousness of having a
native country, the birthplace of common memories and habits of mind,
existing like a parental hearth quitted but beloved; the dignity of
being included in a people which has a part in the comity of nations
and the growing federation of the world; that sense of special belonging
which is the root of human virtues, both public and private,--all these
spiritual links may preserve migratory Englishmen from the worst
consequences of their voluntary dispersion.Unquestionably the Jews,
having been more than any other race exposed to the adverse moral
influences of alienism, must, both in individuals and in groups, have
suffered some corresponding moral degradation; but in fact they have
escaped with less of abjectness and less of hard hostility towards the
nations whose hand has been against them, than could have happened in
the case of a people who had neither their adhesion to a separate
religion founded on historic memories, nor their characteristic family
affectionateness.Tortured, flogged, spit upon, the _corpus vile_ on
which rage or wantonness vented themselves with impunity, their name
flung at them as an opprobrium by superstition, hatred, and contempt,
they have remained proud of their origin.Does any one call this an evil
pride?Perhaps he belongs to that order of man who, while he has a
democratic dislike to dukes and earls, wants to make believe that his
father was an idle gentleman, when in fact he was an honourable artisan,
or who would feel flattered to be taken for other than an Englishman.It
is possible to be too arrogant about our blood or our calling, but that
arrogance is virtue compared with such mean pretence.The pride which
identifies us with a great historic body is a humanising, elevating
habit of mind, inspiring sacrifices of individual comfort, gain, or
other selfish ambition, for the sake of that ideal whole; and no man
swayed by such a sentiment can become completely abject.That a Jew of
Smyrna, where a whip is carried by passengers ready to flog off the too
officious specimens of his race, can still be proud to say, "I am a
Jew," is surely a fact to awaken admiration in a mind capable of
understanding what we may call the ideal forces in human history.And
again, a varied, impartial observation of the Jews in different
countries tends to the impression that they have a predominant
kindliness which must have been deeply ingrained in the constitution of
their race to have outlasted the ages of persecution and oppression.The concentration of their joys in domestic life has kept up in them the
capacity of tenderness: the pity for the fatherless and the widow, the
care for the women and the little ones, blent intimately with their
religion, is a well of mercy that cannot long or widely be pent up by
exclusiveness.And the kindliness of the Jew overflows the line of
division between him and the Gentile.On the whole, one of the most
remarkable phenomena in the history of this scattered people, made for
ages "a scorn and a hissing" is, that after being subjected to this
process, which might have been expected to be in every sense
deteriorating and vitiating, they have come out of it (in any estimate
which allows for numerical proportion) rivalling the nations of all
European countries in healthiness and beauty of _physique_, in practical
ability, in scientific and artistic aptitude, and in some forms of
ethical value.A significant indication of their natural rank is seen in
the fact that at this moment, the leader of the Liberal party in Germany
is a Jew, the leader of the Republican party in France is a Jew, and the
head of the Conservative ministry in England is a Jew.And here it is
that we find the ground for the obvious jealousy which is now
stimulating the revived expression of old antipathies."The Jews," it is
felt, "have a dangerous tendency to get the uppermost places not only in
commerce but in political life.Their monetary hold on governments is
tending to perpetuate in leading Jews a spirit of universal alienism
(euphemistically called cosmopolitanism), even where the West has given
them a full share in civil and political rights.A people with oriental
sunlight in their blood, yet capable of being everywhere acclimatised,
they have a force and toughness which enables them to carry off the best
prizes; and their wealth is likely to put half the seats in Parliament
at their disposal."There is truth in these views of Jewish social and political relations.But it is rather too late for liberal pleaders to urge them in a merely
vituperative sense.Do they propose as a remedy for the impending danger
of our healthier national influences getting overridden by Jewish
predominance, that we should repeal our emancipatory laws?Not all the
Germanic immigrants who have been settling among us for generations,
and are still pouring in to settle, are Jews, but thoroughly Teutonic
and more or less Christian craftsmen, mechanicians, or skilled and
erudite functionaries; and the Semitic Christians who swarm among us are
dangerously like their unconverted brethren in complexion, persistence,
and wealth.Then there are the Greeks who, by the help of Phoenician
blood or otherwise, are objectionably strong in the city.Some judges
think that the Scotch are more numerous and prosperous here in the South
than is quite for the good of us Southerners; and the early
inconvenience felt under the Stuarts of being quartered upon by a
hungry, hard-working people with a distinctive accent and form of
religion, and higher cheek-bones than English taste requires, has not
yet been quite neutralised.As for the Irish, it is felt in high
quarters that we have always been too lenient towards them;--at least,
if they had been harried a little more there might not have been so many
of them on the English press, of which they divide the power with the
Scotch, thus driving many Englishmen to honest and ineloquent labour.So far shall we be carried if we go in search of devices to hinder
people of other blood than our own from getting the advantage of
dwelling among us.Let it be admitted that it is a calamity to the English, as to any other
great historic people, to undergo a premature fusion with immigrants of
alien blood; that its distinctive national characteristics should be in
danger of obliteration by the predominating quality of foreign settlers.I not only admit this, I am ready to unite in groaning over the
threatened danger.To one who loves his native language, who would
delight to keep our rich and harmonious English undefiled by foreign
accent, foreign intonation, and those foreign tinctures of verbal
meaning which tend to confuse all writing and discourse, it is an
affliction as harassing as the climate, that on our stage, in our
studios, at our public and private gatherings, in our offices,
warehouses, and workshops, we must expect to hear our beloved English
with its words clipped, its vowels stretched and twisted, its phrases of
acquiescence and politeness, of cordiality, dissidence or argument,
delivered always in the wrong tones, like ill-rendered melodies, marred
beyond recognition; that there should be a general ambition to speak
every language except our mother English, which persons "of style" are
not ashamed of corrupting with slang, false foreign equivalents, and a
pronunciation that crushes out all colour from the vowels and jams them
between jostling consonants.An ancient Greek might not like to be
resuscitated for the sake of hearing Homer read in our universities,
still he would at least find more instructive marvels in other
developments to be witnessed at those institutions; but a modern
Englishman is invited from his after-dinner repose to hear Shakspere
delivered under circumstances which offer no other novelty than some
novelty of false intonation, some new distribution of strong emphasis on
prepositions, some new misconception of a familiar idiom.it is
our inertness that is in fault, our carelessness of excellence, our
willing ignorance of the treasures that lie in our national heritage,
while we are agape after what is foreign, though it may be only a vile
imitation of what is native.This marring of our speech, however, is a minor evil compared with what
must follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose
appreciation of our political and social life must often be as
approximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language.But take the worst issues--what can we do to hinder them?Are we to
adopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese?Are we
to tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the
world-wide blessing of the oppressed?It is not agreeable to find
foreign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant
exception to the general rule of discourse.But to urge on that account
that we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of
international relations not in the long-run favourable to the interests
of our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call
obtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and
cheaply idle living to be found.In meeting the national evils which are
brought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no
more immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller
national excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more
excellent individual natives.The tendency of things is towards the
quicker or slower fusion of races.It is impossible to arrest this
tendency: all we can do is to moderate its course so as to hinder it
from degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement
of those national traditions and customs which are the language of the
national genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment.Such moderating
and guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort.And it is
in this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities
has value.That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form
a state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government
has been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and
in virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European
councils.Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though
far-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination.We
have to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before
we can be sure of our ground.The only point in this connection on which Englishmen are agreed is,
that England itself shall not be subject to foreign rule.The fiery
resolve to resist invasion, though with an improvised array of
pitchforks, is felt to be virtuous, and to be worthy of a historic
people.Because there is a national life in our veins.Because
there is something specifically English which we feel to be supremely
worth striving for, worth dying for, rather than living to renounce it.Because we too have our share--perhaps a principal share--in that spirit
of separateness which has not yet done its work in the education of
mankind, which has created the varying genius of nations, and, like the
Muses, is the offspring of memory.Here, as everywhere else, the human task seems to be the discerning and
adjustment of opposite claims.But the end can hardly be achieved by
urging contradictory reproaches, and instead of labouring after
discernment as a preliminary to intervention, letting our zeal burst
forth according to a capricious selection, first determined accidentally
and afterwards justified by personal predilection.Not only John Gilpin
and his wife, or Edwin and Angelina, seem to be of opinion that their
preference or dislike of Russians, Servians, or Greeks, consequent,
perhaps, on hotel adventures, has something to do with the merits of the
Eastern Question; even in a higher range of intellect and enthusiasm we
find a distribution of sympathy or pity for sufferers of different blood
or votaries of differing religions, strangely unaccountable on any other
ground than a fortuitous direction of study or trivial circumstances of
travel.With some even admirable persons, one is never quite sure of any
particular being included under a general term.A provincial physician,
it is said, once ordering a lady patient not to eat salad, was asked
pleadingly by the affectionate husband whether she might eat lettuce, or
cresses, or radishes.The physician had too rashly believed in the
comprehensiveness of the word "salad," just as we, if not enlightened by
experience, might believe in the all-embracing breadth of "sympathy with
the injured and oppressed."What mind can exhaust the grounds of
exception which lie in each particular case?There is understood to be a
peculiar odour from the <DW64> body, and we know that some persons, too
rationalistic to feel bound by the curse on Ham, used to hint very
strongly that this odour determined the question on the side of <DW64>
slavery.And this is the usual level of thinking in polite society concerning the
Jews.Apart from theological purposes, it seems to be held surprising
that anybody should take an interest in the history of a people whose
literature has furnished all our devotional language; and if any
reference is made to their past or future destinies some hearer is sure
to state as a relevant fact which may assist our judgment, that she, for
her part, is not fond of them, having known a Mr Jacobson who was very
unpleasant, or that he, for his part, thinks meanly of them as a race,
though on inquiry you find that he is so little acquainted with their
characteristics that he is astonished to learn how many persons whom he
has blindly admired and applauded are Jews to the backbone.Again, men
who consider themselves in the very van of modern advancement, knowing
history and the latest philosophies of history, indicate their
contemptuous surprise that any one should entertain the destiny of the
Jews as a worthy subject, by referring to Moloch and their own
agreement with the theory that the religion of Jehovah was merely a
transformed Moloch-worship, while in the same breath they are glorifying
"civilisation" as a transformed tribal existence of which some
lineaments are traceable in grim marriage customs of the native
Australians.Are these erudite persons prepared to insist that the name
"Father" should no longer have any sanctity for us, because in their
view of likelihood our Aryan ancestors were mere improvers on a state of
things in which nobody knew his own father?For less theoretic men, ambitious, to be regarded as practical
politicians, the value of the Hebrew race has been measured by their
unfavourable opinion of a prime minister who is a Jew by lineage.But it
is possible to form a very ugly opinion as to the scrupulousness of
Walpole or of Chatham; and in any case I think Englishmen would refuse
to accept the character and doings of those eighteenth century statesmen
as the standard of value for the English people and the part they have
to play in the fortunes of mankind.If we are to consider the future of the Jews at all, it seems
reasonable to take as a preliminary question: Are they destined to
complete fusion with the peoples among whom they are dispersed, losing
every remnant of a distinctive consciousness as Jews; or, are there in
the breadth and intensity with which the feeling of separateness, or
what we may call the organised memory of a national consciousness,
actually exists in the world-wide Jewish communities--the seven millions
scattered from east to west--and again, are there in the political
relations of the world, the conditions present or approaching for the
restoration of a Jewish state planted on the old ground as a centre of
national feeling, a source of dignifying protection, a special channel
for special energies which may contribute some added form of national
genius, and an added voice in the councils of the world?They are among us everywhere: it is useless to say we are not fond of
them.Perhaps we are not fond of proletaries and their tendency to form
Unions, but the world is not therefore to be rid of them.If we wish to
free ourselves from the inconveniences that we have to complain of,
whether in proletaries or in Jews, our best course is to encourage all
means of improving these neighbours who elbow us in a thickening crowd,
and of sending their incommodious energies into beneficent channels.Why
are we so eager for the dignity of certain populations of whom perhaps
we have never seen a single specimen, and of whose history, legend, or
literature we have been contentedly ignorant for ages, while we sneer at
the notion of a renovated national dignity for the Jews, whose ways of
thinking and whose very verbal forms are on our lips in every prayer
which we end with an Amen?Some of us consider this question dismissed
when they have said that the wealthiest Jews have no desire to forsake
their European palaces, and go to live in Jerusalem.But in a return
from exile, in the restoration of a people, the question is not whether
certain rich men will choose to remain behind, but whether there will be
found worthy men who will choose to lead the return.Plenty of
prosperous Jews remained in Babylon when Ezra marshalled his band of
forty thousand and began a new glorious epoch in the history of his
race, making the preparation for that epoch in the history of the world
which has been held glorious enough to be dated from for evermore.The
hinge of possibility is simply the existence of an adequate community of
feeling as well as widespread need in the Jewish race, and the hope that
among its finer specimens there may arise some men of instruction and
ardent public spirit, some new Ezras, some modern Maccabees, who will
know how to use all favouring outward conditions, how to triumph by
heroic example, over the indifference of their fellows and the scorn of
their foes, and will steadfastly set their faces towards making their
people once more one among the nations.Formerly, evangelical orthodoxy was prone to dwell on the fulfilment of
prophecy in the "restoration of the Jews," Such interpretation of the
prophets is less in vogue now.The dominant mode is to insist on a
Christianity that disowns its origin, that is not a substantial growth
having a genealogy, but is a vaporous reflex of modern notions.The
Christ of Matthew had the heart of a Jew--"Go ye first to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel."The Apostle of the Gentiles had the heart
of a Jew: "For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: who are Israelites; to whom
pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the
giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are
the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came."Modern
apostles, extolling Christianity, are found using a different tone: they
prefer the mediaeval cry translated into modern phrase.But the
mediaeval cry too was in substance very ancient--more ancient than the
days of Augustus.Pagans in successive ages said, "These people are
unlike us, and refuse to be made like us: let us punish them."The Jews
were steadfast in their separateness, and through that separateness
Christianity was born.A modern book on Liberty has maintained that from
the freedom of individual men to persist in idiosyncrasies the world may
be enriched.Why should we not apply this argument to the idiosyncrasy
of a nation, and pause in our haste to hoot it down?There is still a
great function for the steadfastness of the Jew: not that he should
shut out the utmost illumination which knowledge can throw on his
national history, but that he should cherish the store of inheritance
which that history has left him.Every Jew should be conscious that he
is one of a multitude possessing common objects of piety in the immortal
achievements and immortal sorrows of ancestors who have transmitted to
them a physical and mental type strong enough, eminent enough in
faculties, pregnant enough with peculiar promise, to constitute a new
beneficent individuality among the nations, and, by confuting the
traditions of scorn, nobly avenge the wrongs done to their Fathers.There is a sense in which the worthy child of a nation that has brought
forth illustrious prophets, high and unique among the poets of the
world, is bound by their visions.Yes, for the effective bond of human action is feeling, and the worthy
child of a people owning the triple name of Hebrew, Israelite, and Jew,
feels his kinship with the glories and the sorrows, the degradation and
the possible renovation of his national family.Will any one teach the nullification of this feeling and call his
doctrine a philosophy?He will teach a blinding superstition--the
superstition that a theory of human wellbeing can be constructed in
disregard of the influences which have made us human.From their narrow point of view, it seemed to them that
these steps were a direct encouragement of the slave-trade, and they
denounced Gordon's action with an extraordinary, but none the less
bitter, ignorance of the fact that he was employing the only practical
means of carrying out the mission which, in addition to his
administrative duties, had been practically imposed on him as the
representative of civilization.These good but misinformed persons
must have believed that the Egyptian garrison in the Soudan was
efficient, that communications were easy, and the climate not
unpleasant, and that Gordon, supported by zealous lieutenants, had
only to hold up his hand or pass a resolution, in the fashion of
Exeter Hall, for the chains, real and metaphysical, to fall from the
limbs of the <DW64> population of Inner Africa.The reality was a worthless and craven army, a climate that killed
most Europeans, and which the vigour and abstemiousness of Gordon
scarcely enabled him to endure, communications only maintained and
represented by the wearying flight of the camel across the desert,
treachery and hostility to his plans, if not his person, among his
colleagues--all these difficulties and dangers overcome and rendered
nugatory by the earnestness and energy of one man alone.Well might
his indignation find vent in such a grand outburst as this:--

     "I do not believe in you all.You say this and that, and you do
     not do it; you give your money, and you have done your duty; you
     praise one another, etc.God has given you
     ties and anchors to this earth; you have wives and families.I,
     thank God, have none of them, and am free.If
     it suit me, I will buy slaves.I will let captured slaves go down
     to Egypt and not molest them, and I will do what I like, and what
     God, in His mercy, may direct me to do about domestic slaves; but
     I will break the neck of slave raids, even if it cost me my life.I will buy slaves for my army; for this purpose I will make
     soldiers against their will, to enable me to prevent raids.I
     will do this in the light of day, and defy your resolutions and
     your actions.Would my heart be broken if I was ousted from this
     command?Should I regret the eternal camel-riding, the heat, the
     misery I am forced to witness, the discomforts of everything
     around my domestic life?Thousands of miles on camels, and no hope of rest for another
     year.You are only called on at intervals to rely on your God;
     with me I am obliged continually to do so.Find me the man and I
     will take him as my help who utterly despises money, name, glory,
     honour; one who never wishes to see his home again; one who looks
     to God as the Source of good and Controller of evil; one who has
     a healthy body and energetic spirit, and one who looks on death
     as a release from misery; and if you cannot find him, then leave
     me alone.To carry myself is enough for me; I want no other
     baggage."Gordon's troubles were not only with English visionaries.The Egyptian
officials had always regarded the delegation of supreme powers to him
with dislike, and this sentiment became unqualified apprehension when
they saw how resolute he was in exercising them.Ismail Pasha was
disposed to place unlimited trust in his energetic Governor-General,
but he could not but be somewhat influenced by those around him while
Gordon was far away.When, therefore, Gordon took into his own hands
the power of life and death, and sentenced men to be hanged and shot,
he roused that opposition to the highest point of activity, and
received repeated remonstrances by telegraph from Cairo.To these he
replied firmly, but quietly, that on no other condition could the
administration be carried on, and that his authority as Viceroy would
be undermined if he could not dispense prompt justice.Notwithstanding
all his representations, he never obtained the ratification of his
right to pass death sentences; but with that strong will that he
showed in every crisis, he announced his determination to act on his
own responsibility.On at least two occasions he expresses a feeling
of gratification at having caused murderers to be hung.This is a suitable moment to lay stress on the true views Gordon held
on the subject of bloodshed.While averse to all warfare by
disposition, and without the smallest trace of what might be called
the military spirit, General Gordon had none of that timid and
unreasoning shrinking from taking life, which is often cruel and
always cowardly.He punished the guilty without the least false
compunction, even with a death sentence, and if necessity left no
choice, he would have executed that sentence himself, provided he was
quite convinced of its justice.As a rule, he went unarmed in the
Soudan, as in China; but there were exceptions, and on at least one
occasion he took an active and decisive part in a conflict.He was
being attacked by one of the tribes, and his men were firing wildly
and without result.Then Gordon snatched a rifle from one of his men,
and firing at the hostile leader, killed him.There are at least two
other incidents that will show him in a light that many of his
admirers would keep suppressed, but that bring out his human nature.A
clumsy servant fired off his heavy duck-gun close to his head, and
Gordon very naturally gave him a smart box on the ears which the
fellow would remember for a week.Excited by the misery of a
slave-gang, he asked the boy in charge of them to whom they belonged,
and as he hesitated, he struck him across the face with his whip.Gordon's comment on this act is that it was "cruel and cowardly, but
he was enraged, and could not help it."One feels on reading this that
one would have done so oneself, and that, after all, Gordon was a man,
and not a spiritual abstraction.Thus ended the first eventful year of General Gordon's tenure of the
post of Governor-General of the Soudan.Some idea of the magnitude of
the task he had performed may be gathered from the fact that during
this period he rode nearly 4000 miles on his camel through the desert.He put before himself the solution of eight burning questions, and by
the end of 1877 he had settled five of them more or less permanently.He had also effected many reforms in the military and civil branches
of the administration, and had formed the nucleus of a force in which
he could put some confidence.By the people he was respected and
feared, and far more liked than he imagined."Send us another Governor
like Gordon" was the burden of the Soudanese cry to Slatin when the
shadow of the Mahdi's power had already fallen over the land.When their Mahommedan
co-religionists had ground them down to the dust, even desecrating
their mosques by turning them into powder magazines, General Gordon
showed them justice and merciful consideration, restored and endowed
their mosques, and exhorted them in every way to be faithful to the
observance of their religion.He was always most exact in payment for
services rendered.This became known; and when some of the Egyptian
officials--a Pasha among others--seized camels for his service without
paying for them, the owners threw themselves on the ground, kissing
Gordon's camel's feet, told their tale, and obtained prompt redress.What more striking testimony to his thoughtfulness for others could be
given than in the following anecdote?One of his native lieutenants, a
confirmed drunkard, but of which Gordon was ignorant, became ill, and
the Governor-General went to see and sit by him in his tent.All the
man asked for was brandy, and General Gordon, somewhat shocked at the
repeated request, expostulated with him that he, a believer in the
Koran, should drink the strong waters so expressly forbidden by that
holy book.But the man readily replied, "This is as medicine, and the
Prophet does not forbid us to save life."Gordon said nothing, but
left the tent, and some hours later he sent the man two bottles of
brandy from his own small store.Even the Soudanese, who were afraid
of him in his terrible mood, knew the many soft corners he kept in his
heart, and easily learnt the way to them.For misfortune and suffering
of every kind his sympathy was quickly won, and with his sympathy went
his support, to the utmost limit of his power.After the campaign in Darfour, Gordon returned to Khartoum, where he
was preparing for fresh exertions, as well as for a settlement of the
Abyssinian difficulty, when a sudden and unexpected summons reached
him to come down to Cairo and help the Khedive to arrange his
financial affairs.The Khedive's telegram stated that the Egyptian
creditors were trying to interfere with his sovereign prerogative, and
that His Highness knew no one but Gordon who could assist him out of
this position.The precise date on which this telegram reached Gordon
was 25th January 1878, when he was passing Shendy--the place on the
Nile opposite Metammeh, where the British Expedition encamped in
January 1885--but as he had to return to Khartoum to arrange for the
conduct of the administration during his absence, he did not arrive at
Dongola on his way to the capital until the 20th of the following
month.He reached Cairo on 7th March, was at once carried off to dine
with the Khedive, who had waited more than an hour over the appointed
time for him because his train was late, and, when it was over, was
conveyed to one of the finest palaces, which had been specially
prepared in his honour.The meaning of this extraordinary reception
was that the Khedive Ismail thought he had found a deliverer from his
own troubles in the man who had done such wonders in the Soudan.That
ruler had reached a stage in his affairs when extrication was
impossible, if the creditors of Egypt were to receive their dues.He
was very astute, and he probably saw that the only chance of saving
himself was for some high authority to declare that the interests of
himself and his people must be pronounced paramount to those of the
foreign investors.There was only one man in the world likely to come
to that conclusion, with a spotless reputation and a voice to which
public opinion might be expected to pay heed.Therefore he was sent for in post haste, and found the post of
President of "An Inquiry into the State of the Finances of the
Country" thrust upon him before he had shaken off the dust of his long
journey to Cairo.The motives which induced the Khedive to send for General Gordon
cannot be mistaken; nor is there any obscurity as to those which led
General Gordon to accept a task in which he was bound to run counter
to the views of every other European authority, and still more to the
fixed policy of his and other Governments.In the first place, Gordon
being the servant of the Khedive, it would have been impossible for
him to have said no to a request which was entitled to be regarded as
a command.In the second place, Gordon did not know all the currents
of intrigue working between Cairo and the capitals of Europe, and he
convinced himself that a sound workable plan for the benefit of Egypt
and her people would command such general approval that "the financial
cormorants," as he termed the bondholders, or rather their leaders,
would have to retire beaten from the field.He had no doubt that he
could draw up such a plan, based on a suspension and permanent
reduction of interest, and the result will convince any disinterested
person of the fact, but Gordon was destined to find that all persons
cannot be guided by such disinterestedness as his, of which the way he
treated his Egyptian salary furnished such a striking instance.When
sent to the Equator, he was offered L10,000 a year, and accepted
L2000; as Governor-General, he was nominated at L12,000 a year, and
cut it down to a half; and when, during this very Cairo visit, a new
and unnecessary official was appointed under the Soudan
Administration, he insisted that his own salary should be further
reduced to L3000, to compensate for this further charge.Such an
example as this did not arouse enthusiasm or inspire emulation in the
Delta.General Gordon never dealt with a question in which abstract
justice was deemed more out of place, or had less chance of carrying
the day.As the matter was very important, and interested persons might easily
have misrepresented his part in it, General Gordon drew up a
memorandum explaining every incident in the course of the affair.This document was published by his brother, Sir Henry Gordon, in 1886,
and the following description merely summarises its contents.As far back as the year 1875 the Khedive Ismail began to discover that
the financial position of his Government was bad, and that it would be
impossible to keep up the payment of the interest on the debt at the
high rate of seven per cent., which Egypt had bound itself to pay.He
therefore applied to the British Government for advice and assistance.In response to his representations, a Financial Commission, composed
of three members--Mr Cave, Colonel Stokes, and Mr Rivers Wilson--was
sent to Egypt for the purpose of inquiring into the financial position
of that country.They had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion
that it was unsound, and that the uneasiness of Ismail Pasha had not
been expressed a day too soon.They recommended that an arrangement
should be come to with the bondholders by which all the loans were to
be placed on the same footing, and the rate of interest reduced to
some figure that might be agreed upon.It then became necessary to
negotiate with the bondholders, who appointed Mr Goschen for the
English section, and M. Joubert for the French, to look after their
rights.The result of their efforts in 1876 was that they united the
loans into one, bearing a uniform rate of six per cent, instead of
seven, and that four Commissioners were appointed to look after the
debt in the interests of the bondholders, while two other European
officials were nominated--one to control the receipts, the other the
expenditure.In less than two years Ismail Pasha discovered that this
arrangement had not remedied the evil, and that the Government was
again on the verge of bankruptcy.It was at this juncture that the
Khedive applied to General Gordon, in the hope that his ability and
reputation would provide an easy escape from his dilemma.General Gordon agreed to accept the post of President of this
Commission of Inquiry, and he also fell in with the Khedive's own wish
and suggestion that the Commissioners of the Debt should not be
members of the Commission.This point must be carefully borne in mind,
as the whole negotiation failed because of the Khedive's weakness in
waiving the very point he rightly deemed vital for success.Having
laid down the only principle to which he attached importance, the
Khedive went on to say that M. de Lesseps would act in conjunction
with General Gordon, and that these two, with some vague assistance
from financial experts, were to form the Commission.It soon became
evident that M. de Lesseps had no serious views on the subject, and
that he was only too much disposed to yield to external influences.On the very threshold of his task, which he took up with his usual
thoroughness and honest desire to get at the truth, General Gordon
received a warning that the greatest difficulties were not those
inherent to the subject, but those arising from the selfish designs of
interested persons.As soon as it became known that General Gordon had
accepted this task, and that he had agreed to the Khedive's suggestion
that the Debt Commissioners were not to sit on the Commission, there
was a loud outburst of disapproval and dismay in diplomatic and
financial circles.This part of the story must be given in his own
words:--

     "Mr Vivian, the English Consul-General, said to me, 'I wonder you
     could accept the Presidency of the Commission of Inquiry without
     the Commissioners of the Debt.'I said, 'I was free to accept or
     refuse.'"I then called on the German Consul-General, and when there the
     French and Austrian Consuls-General, and also Vivian, came in,
     and attacked me for having accepted the post of President.I said
     'I was free.'And then they said, 'I was risking his Highness his
     throne; that he ran a very serious risk personally, if he formed
     the Commission of Inquiry without the creditors' representatives,
     viz.I said, 'Why do you not tell
     him so?'They said, 'You ought to do so.'I said, 'Well, will you
     commission me to do so, from you, with any remarks I like to make
     as to the futility of your words?'They all said, 'Yes, we
     authorise you to do so--in our names.'"General Gordon went that evening to the Abdin Palace, where he was
engaged to dine with the Khedive; and having asked permission to make
an important communication, saw Ismail before dinner, when words to
this effect were exchanged:--

Gordon said: "I have seen the four Consuls-General to-day, and they
told me to tell your Highness from them that you run a serious
personal risk if you have a Commission of Inquiry without the
Commissioners of Debt being upon it."The Khedive replied as follows: "I do not care a bit.I am only afraid
of England, and I feel sure she will not move.You will see Lesseps
to-morrow, and arrange the _enquete_ with him."Encouraged by the
Khedive's firmness, and fully convinced that no good result would
follow if the Debt Commissioners, who only considered the bondholders'
interests, were on this inquiry, Gordon met Lesseps the next morning
in the full expectation that business would now be begun.The further
ramifications of the intrigue, for it soon became one, for the
discomfiture and discrediting of Gordon, must be told in his own
words:

     "The next day Lesseps came to my Palace with Stanton (Stokes's
     old Danube Secretary, now Resident-Commissioner for the British
     Government Suez Canal Shares at Paris, an old friend of mine).Lesseps began, 'We must have the Commissioners of the Debt on the
     _enquete_.'"I said, 'It is a _sine qua non_ that they are not to be upon
     it.'Lesseps replied, 'They must be upon it.'"Then in came Cherif Pasha (the Premier), and said, 'Are you
     agreed?'I left Lesseps to speak, and he said, 'Yes,' at which I
     stared and said, 'I fear not.'Then Lesseps and Cherif discussed
     it, and Lesseps gave in, and agreed to serve on the Commission
     without the Commissioners of the Debt, but with the proviso that
     he would ask permission to do so from Paris.Cherif Pasha was
     pleased."But I instinctively felt old Lesseps was ratting, so I asked
     Cherif to stop a moment, and said to Stanton, 'Now, see that
     Lesseps does not make a mess of it.Let him say at once, Will he
     act without the Commissioners of Debt or not?Do this for my
     sake; take him into that corner and speak to him.'Stanton did
     so, while I took Cherif into the other corner, much against his
     will, for he thought I was a bore, raising obstacles.I told him
     that Lesseps had declared before he came that he would not act
     unless with the Commissioners of the Debt.Cherif was huffed with
     me, and turned to Lesseps, whom Stanton had already dosed in his
     corner of the room, and he and Lesseps had a close conversation
     again for some time; and then Cherif came to me and said,
     'Lesseps has accepted without the Commissioners of the Debt.'"I disgusted Cherif as I went downstairs with him by saying, 'He
     will never stick to it.'"If Gordon was not a diplomatist, he was at least very clear-sighted.He saw clearly through M. de Lesseps, who had no views on the subject,
and who was quite content to play the part his Government assigned
him.A few minutes after the interview described he obtained further
evidence of the hostility the projected inquiry without the
Commissioners had aroused.He met Major Evelyn Baring, then beginning
the Egyptian career which he still pursues as Lord Cromer, who was
desirous of knowing what decision had been arrived at.On hearing that
the Commissioners were to be excluded, Major Baring remarked, "It was
unfair to the creditors," which seems to have drawn from Gordon some
angry retort.There is no doubt that at this moment Gordon lost all
control over himself, and employed personalities that left a sore
feeling behind them.That they did so in this case was, as I am
compelled to show later on, amply demonstrated in December 1883 and
January 1884.The direct and immediate significance of the occurrence
lay in its furnishing fresh evidence of the unanimity of hostility
with which all the European officials in the Delta regarded the
Khedive's proposal, and his attempt to make use of General Gordon's
exceptional character and reputation.It is a reflection on no
particular individual to assert that they were all resolved that
General Gordon's appeal to the abstract sense of justice of the world
should never be promulgated.The first practical proposal made was to telegraph for Mr Samuel
Laing, a trained financier, who had acted in India at the head of the
finances of that country; but General Gordon refused to do this,
because he knew that he would be held responsible for the terms he
came on; and instead he drew up several propositions, one of them
being that the services of Mr Laing should be secured on conditions to
be fixed by the Khedive.During this discussion, it should be noted,
Lesseps paid no attention to business, talking of trivial and
extraneous matters.Then Gordon, with the view of clinching the
matter, said:

     "There are two questions to decide:

     "_First_, How to alleviate the present sufferings of the unpaid
     civil employes and of the army, as well as the pressing claims of
     the floating debt."_Second_, And afterwards to inquire into the real state of the
     revenue by a Commission."This was the exact opposite of the bondholders' view, for the
settlement of the grievances of the public and military service and of
the floating debt would _then_ have left nothing for the payment of
the coupons on the permanent external debt of a hundred millions.In
fact, General Gordon boldly suggested that the funds immediately
wanted must be provided by the non-payment of the next coupon due.It is impossible to resist the conclusion that if General Gordon had
had his way, the Arabi revolt would have been averted; the Khedive
Ismail, the ablest member of his house, would not have been deposed;
and an English occupation of Egypt, hampered by financial and
diplomatic shackles that neutralise the value of its temporary
possession, need never have been undertaken.It is equally impossible to resist the conclusion that the forces
arrayed against Gordon on this occasion were such as he could not
expect to conquer.The concluding scenes of the affair need only be briefly described.M.
de Lesseps had never swerved from his original purpose to refer the
matter to Paris, but even Gordon was not prepared for the duplicity he
showed in the matter, and in which he was no doubt encouraged by the
prevalent feeling among the foreigners at Cairo.The first point in
all tortuous diplomacy, Eastern or Western, is to gain time; and when
General Gordon, intent on business, called on Lesseps the next
day--that is to say, two days after his arrival from Khartoum--the
French engineer met him with the smiling observation that he was off
for a day in the country, and that he had just sent a telegram to
Paris.He handed Gordon a copy, which was to this effect: "His
Highness the Khedive has begged me to join with M. Gordon and _the
Commissioners of the Debt_ in making an inquiry into the finances of
Egypt; I ask permission."Gordon's astonished ejaculation "This will
never do" was met with the light-hearted Frenchman's remark, "I must
go, and it must go."Then General Gordon hastened with the news and the draft of the
telegram to the Khedive.The copy was sent in to Ismail Pasha in his
private apartments.On mastering its contents, he rushed out, threw
himself on a sofa, and exclaimed, "I am quite upset by this telegram
of Lesseps; some one must go after him and tell him not to send it."Then turning to Gordon, he said, "I put the whole affair into your
hands."Gordon, anxious to help the Khedive, and also hoping to find
an ally out of Egypt, telegraphed at great length to Mr Goschen, in
accordance with the Khedive's suggestion.Unfortunately, Mr Goschen
replied with equal brevity and authority, "I will not look at you; the
matter is in the hands of Her Majesty's Government."When we remember
that Gordon was the properly-appointed representative of an
independent Prince, or at least of a Prince independent of England, we
cannot wonder at his terming this a "rude answer."Mr Goschen may have
had some after-qualms himself, for he telegraphed some days later in a
milder tone, but Gordon would not take an affront from any man, and
left it unanswered.At this crisis Gordon, nothing daunted, made a proposal which, if the
Khedive had had the courage to carry it out, might have left the
victory with them.He proposed to the Khedive to issue a decree
suspending the payment of the coupon, paying all pressing claims, and
stating that he did all this on the advice of Gordon.Failing that,
Gordon offered to telegraph himself to Lord Derby, the Foreign
Secretary, and accept the full responsibility for the measure.Ismail
was not equal to the occasion.He shut himself up in his harem for two
days, and, as Gordon said, "the game was lost."General Gordon was now to experience the illimitable extent of human
ingratitude.Even those who disagreed with the views he expressed on
this subject cannot deny his loyalty to the Khedive, or the magnitude
of the efforts he made on his behalf.To carry out the wishes of the
Prince in whose service he was for the time being, he was prepared to
accept every responsibility, and to show an unswerving devotion in a
way that excited the opposition and hostility even of those whom he
might otherwise have termed his friends and well-wishers.By an
extreme expedient, which would either have ruined himself or thwarted
the plans of powerful statesmen, and financiers not less powerful, he
would have sealed his devotion to Ismail Pasha; but the moral or
physical weakness of the Oriental prevented the attempt being made.The delay mentioned allowed of fresh pressure being brought to bear on
the Khedive; and while Gordon emphatically declared, partly from a
sense of consistency, and partly because he hoped to stiffen the
Khedive's resolution that he would not act with the Debt Commissioners
on the Inquiry, Ismail Pasha was coerced or induced into surrendering
all he had been fighting for.He gave his assent to the Commissioners
being on the Inquiry, and he turned his back on the man who had come
from the heart of Africa to his assistance.When Gordon learnt these
facts, he resolved to return to the Soudan, and he was allowed to do
so without the least mark of honour or word of thanks from the
Khedive.His financial episode cost him L800 out of his own pocket,
and even if we consider that the financial situation in the Delta,
with all its cross-currents of shady intrigue and selfish designs, was
one that he was not quite qualified to deal with, we cannot dispute
that his propositions were full of all his habitual nobility of
purpose, and that they were practical, if they could ever have been
put into effect.This incident serves to bring out some of the limitations of Gordon's
ability.His own convictions, strengthened by the solitary life he had
led for years in the Soudan, did not make him well adapted for any
form of diplomacy.His methods were too simple, and his remedies too
exclusively based on a radical treatment, to suit every complaint in a
complicated state of society; nor is it possible for the majority of
men to be influenced by his extraordinary self-abnegation and
disregard for money.During this very mission he boasted that he was
able to get to bed at eight o'clock, because he never dined out, and
that he did not care at everyone laughing at him, and saying he was in
the sulks.This mode of living was due, not to any peculiarity about
General Gordon--although I trace to this period the opinion that he
was mad--but mainly to his honest wish not to be biassed by any
European's judgment, and to be able to give the Khedive absolutely
independent advice, as if he himself were an Egyptian, speaking and
acting for Egypt.Enough has been said to explain why he failed to
accomplish a really impossible task.Nor is it necessary to assume
that because they differed from him and strenuously opposed his
project, the other Englishmen in authority in the Delta were
influenced by any unworthy motives or pursued a policy that was either
reprehensible or unsound.From this uncongenial task General Gordon returned to the work which
he thoroughly understood, and with regard to which he had to apprehend
no serious outside interference, for the attraction of the flesh-pots
of Egypt did not extend into the Soudan.Still, he felt that his
"outspokenness," as he termed it, had not strengthened his position.He travelled on this occasion by the Red Sea route to Aden, thence to
Zeila, with the view of inspecting Harrar, which formed part of his
extensive Government.During this tour Gordon saw much that disquieted
him--a large strip of country held by fanatical Mahommedans, the slave
trade in unchecked progress where he had not thought it to exist--and
he wrote these memorable words: "Our English Government lives on a
hand-to-mouth policy.They are very ignorant of these lands, yet some
day or other they or some other Government will have to know them, for
things at Cairo cannot stay as they are.His Highness will be curbed
in, and will no longer be absolute sovereign; then will come the
question of these countries."At Harrar, Gordon dismissed the Governor Raouf, whom he describes as a
regular tyrant, but who, none the less for his misdeeds, was
proclaimed Governor-General of the Soudan when Gordon left it less
than two years after this visit to Harrar.When this affair was
settled, General Gordon proceeded _via_ Massowah and Souakim to
Khartoum, where he arrived about the middle of June.On his way he had
felt bound to remove eight high military officers from their commands
for various offences, from which may be gathered some idea of the
colleagues on whom he had to depend.He reached Khartoum not a moment
too soon, for the first news that greeted him was that Suleiman had
broken out in open revolt, and was practically master of the Province
of Bahr Gazelle, which lies between Darfour and the Equatorial
Province.But before describing the steps he took to suppress this formidable
revolt, which resembled the rising under the Mahdi in every point
except its non-religious character, some notice may be given of the
financial difficulties with which he had to cope, and which were much
increased by the Khedive's practice of giving appointments in a
promiscuous manner that were to be chargeable on the scanty and
inadequate revenues of the Soudan.In the year 1877 the expenditure of the Soudan exceeded the revenue by
over a quarter of a million sterling; in 1878 Gordon had reduced this
deficit to L70,000.In the return given by the Khedive of his
resources when foreign intervention first took place, it was stated
that the Soudan furnished a tribute of L143,000.This was untrue; it
had always been a drain on the Cairo exchequer until in 1879 General
Gordon had the satisfaction, by reducing expenditure in every possible
direction and abolishing sinecures, of securing an exact balance.The
most formidable adversary Gordon had to meet in the course of this
financial struggle was the Khedive himself, and it was only by
sustained effort that he succeeded in averting the imposition of
various expenses on his shoulders which would have rendered success
impossible.First it was two steamers, which would have cost L20,000;
then it was the so-called Soudan railway, with a liability of not less
than three quarters of a million with which the Khedive wished to
saddle the Soudan, but Gordon would have neither, and his firmness
carried the day.When the Cairo authorities, in want of money, claimed
that the Soudan owed L30,000, he went into the items, and showed that,
instead, Cairo owed it L9000.He never got it, but by this he proved
that, while he was the servant of the Khedive, he would not be
subservient to him in matters that affected the successful discharge
of his task as that Prince's deputy in the Soudan.We must now return to the revolt of Suleiman, the most serious
military peril Gordon had to deal with in Africa, which was in its
main features similar to the later uprising under the Mahdi.At the
first collision with that young leader of the slave-dealers, Gordon
had triumphed by his quickness and daring; but he had seen that
Suleiman was not thoroughly cowed, and he had warned him that if he
revolted again the result would inevitably be his ruin.Suleiman had
not taken the warning to heart, and was now in open revolt.His most
powerful supporters were the Arab colonies, long settled in interior
Africa, who, proud of their descent, were always willing to take part
against the Turco-Egyptian Government.These men rallied to a certain
extent to Suleiman, just as some years later they attached themselves
to the Mahdi.As General Gordon wrote in 1878: "They were ready, and
are still ready, to seize the first chance of shaking off the yoke of
Egypt."It was during Gordon's absence at Cairo that Suleiman's plans
matured, and he began the campaign by seizing the province of Bahr
Gazelle.Immediately on receiving this intelligence, General Gordon
fitted out an expedition; and as he could not take the command
himself, he intrusted it to his best lieutenant, Romolo Gessi, an
Italian of proved merit.Heavy
floods kept Gessi confined in his camp during three months, and the
lukewarm supporters of the Government regarded this inaction as proof
of inferiority.They consequently rallied to Suleiman, who soon found
himself at the head of a force of 6000 men, while Gessi had only 300
regulars, two cannon, and 700 almost useless irregulars.It was as
difficult for him to let the Governor-General know that he needed
reinforcements as it was for General Gordon to send them.Some of his
subordinates, in command of outlying detachments, refused to obey his
summons, preferring to carry on a little slave-hunting on their own
account.His troops were on the verge of mutiny: he had to shoot one
ringleader with his own hand.At last the floods fell, and he began his forward movement, fighting
his way against detached bodies of slave-hunters, but after each
success receiving the welcome of the unfortunate natives, of whom
Suleiman had consigned not fewer than 10,000 in the six previous
months to slavery.At last Gessi was himself compelled to halt at a
place called Dem Idris, fifty miles north of the fort which Suleiman
had constructed for his final stand, and named after himself.These
places are about 200 miles south of both Dara and Shaka, while between
them runs the considerable stream called Bahr Arab.Gessi was now in
close proximity to the main force under Suleiman, but he had to halt
for five months before he felt in any way equal to the task of
attacking it.During that period he had to stand on the defensive, and
sustain several attacks from Suleiman, who had made all his plans for
invading Darfour, and adding that province to the Bahr Gazelle.The first of these engagements was that fought on 28th December 1878,
when Suleiman, at the head of 10,000 men, attacked Gessi's camp at Dem
Idris.Fortunately, he had neglected no precaution, and his regulars,
supported by a strong force of friendly natives, nobly seconded his
efforts.Suleiman's force was repulsed in four assaults, and had to
retire with a loss of 1000 men.But Gessi's difficulties were far from
removed by this victory.Suleiman's losses were easily repaired, while
those of Gessi could not be replaced.His men were also suffering from
fever, and the strain on himself, through the absence of any
subordinates to assist him, was terrible.It was a relief to him when
Suleiman delivered his second attack, fifteen days after the first.On
this occasion Suleiman appealed to the religious fanaticism of his
followers, and made them swear on the Koran to conquer or die; and the
black troops, as the less trustworthy, were placed in the van of
battle and driven to the assault by the Arabs.Gessi made an excellent
disposition of his troops, repulsing the two main attacks with heavy
loss; and when the attack was resumed the next day, his success was
equally complete.Unfortunately, Gessi was unable to follow up this
advantage, because his powder was almost exhausted, and his men were
reduced to pick up bullets from the field of combat.Tidings of his
position reached Suleiman, who made a final attack on the 28th of
January 1879, but owing to the fortunate arrival of a small supply of
powder, Gessi was able to fight and win another battle.It was not until the 11th March, however, that Gessi received a
sufficient supply of ammunition to enable him to assume the offensive.Suleiman's camp or fort was a strongly barricaded enclosure,
surrounded by a double row of trunks of trees.The centre of the
enclosure was occupied by an inner fort, which was Suleiman's own
residence.On Gessi attacking it, his first shell set fire to one of
the huts, and as the wood was dry, the whole encampment was soon in a
blaze.Driven to desperation, the brigands sallied forth, only to be
driven back by the steady fire of Gessi's troops, who by this time
were full of confidence in their leader.Then the former broke into
flight, escaping wherever they could.Suleiman was among those who
escaped, although eleven of his chiefs were slain, and the unfortunate
exhaustion of Gessi's powder again provided him with the respite to
rally his followers and make another bid for power.This further period of enforced inaction terminated at the end of
April, when the arrival of a full supply of powder and cartridges
enabled Gessi to take the field for the last time.On the 1st May the
Egyptian commander started to attack the slave robber in his last
stronghold, Dem Suleiman.Three days later he fought the first of
these final battles outside that fort, and succeeded in cutting off
the retreat of the vanquished Arabs into that place of shelter.He
then broke into the fort itself, where there were only a few men, and
he almost succeeded in capturing Suleiman, who fled through one gate
as Gessi entered by another.Thanks to the fleetness of his horse,
Suleiman succeeded in making good his escape.Before his hurried
flight Suleiman murdered four prisoners sooner than allow of their
recapture, and throughout the long pursuit that now began all slaves
or black troops who could not keep up were killed.These were not the
only crimes perpetrated by these brigands.Superstition, or the mere
pleasure of cruelty, had induced them when their fortunes were getting
low to consecrate a new banner by bathing it in the blood of a
murdered child.For these iniquities the hour of expiation had now
arrived.After the capture of Dem Suleiman, Gessi began a pursuit which,
considering the difficulties of the route owing to heavy rain,
topographical ignorance, and the deficiency of supplies, may be
characterised as remarkable.Gessi took with him only 600 men, armed
with Remington rifles; but they could carry no more than three or four
days' provisions, which were exhausted before he came up with even the
rearmost of the fugitive Arabs.There the troops turned sulky, and it
was only by promising them as spoil everything taken that he restored
them to something like good temper.Six days after the start Gessi
overwhelmed one band under Abou Sammat, one of the most active of the
slave-hunters, and learnt that Suleiman himself was only twenty-four
hours ahead.But the difficulties were such that Gessi was almost
reduced to despair of the capture of that leader, and as long as he
remained at large the rebellion could not be considered suppressed.Fortune played the game into his hand at the very moment that the
result seemed hopeless.In the middle of the night several men came to
his camp from Sultan Idris, one of the Arab chiefs, thinking it was
that of Rabi, the chief of Suleiman's lieutenants.Gessi sent one of
them back to invite him to approach, and at once laid his own plans.He resolved to destroy Rabi's force, which lay encamped close by,
before the other band could come up; and by a sudden assault at
daybreak he succeeded in his object.The whole band was exterminated,
with the exception of Rabi himself, who escaped on a fast horse.Then
Gessi laid his ambuscade for Sultan Idris, who marched into the trap
prepared for him.This band also was nearly annihilated, but Sultan
Idris escaped, leaving, however, an immense spoil, which put the
Egyptian soldiers in good humour.For the disposal of this booty, and
for other reasons, Gessi resolved to return to Dem Suleiman.At this point it was alone possible to criticise the action of the
energetic Gessi during the whole course of the campaign, and General
Gordon no doubt thought that if he had paid no attention to the spoil
captured from Rabi and Sultan Idris, but pressed the pursuit against
Suleiman, he might then and there have concluded the campaign.On the
other hand, it is only fair to state that Gessi had to consider the
sentiment of his own troops, while he was also ill from the mental
strain and physical exertion of conducting the campaign virtually by
himself.The spoil, moreover, did not benefit him in the least.It
went into the coffers of the Government, or the pockets of the
soldiers, not into his.So little reward did he receive that Gordon
intended at first to give him L1000 out of his own pocket, and
eventually found himself able to increase it to a sum of L2000 out of
the Soudan exchequer.But Suleiman was still at large, and the slave-dealers were fully
determined to preserve their profitable monopoly, if by any means they
could baffle the Government.The Egyptian officials were also inclined
to assist their efforts, and while Gessi was recovering his strength,
he had the mortification of seeing the fruits of his earlier success
lost by the inaction or more culpable proceedings of his lieutenants.It was not until July 1879 that Gessi felt able to take the field in
person, and then with less than 300 men, while Suleiman's band alone
numbered 900.But there was no time to wait for reinforcements if
Suleiman, who had advanced to within a short distance of Gessi's camp,
was to be captured.Owing to the promptitude of his measures, Gessi
came up with Suleiman in three days' time at the village of Gara,
which he reached at daybreak on 16th of July.Concealing his troops in a wood, so that the smallness
of their numbers might not be detected, he sent in a summons to
Suleiman to surrender within ten minutes.Surprised, and ignorant of
the strength of the Egyptian force, he and his followers agreed to lay
down their arms: but when Suleiman saw the mere handful of men to whom
he had yielded, he burst out crying.The situation suggested to him
the hope of escape.Gessi learnt that when night came Suleiman and his
men had arranged to break their way through.He therefore resolved to
anticipate them.He held in his hands the ringleaders of the
rebellion.If they escaped, all his work was lost; a summary act of
justice would conclude the affair, and secure the Government against
fresh attacks for a long time.To use his own words, Gessi "saw that
the time had come to have done with these people once for all."The first, composed of the
black soldiers, little better than slaves, he released on the
condition that they left at once and promised to settle down to a
peaceful life.Having got rid of these,
the larger number of Suleiman's band, he seized the smaller body of
slave-dealers--157 in number--and having chained them, sent them under
a guard as prisoners to his own camp.Then he seized Suleiman and ten
of his chief supporters, and shot them on the spot.Thus perished
Suleiman, the son of Zebehr, in whose name and for whose safety he had
gone into revolt, in the very way that Gordon had predicted two years
before in the midst of his brigand power at Shaka; and thus, with a
remarkable combination of skill and courage, did Gessi bring his
arduous campaign of twelve months' duration to a victorious
conclusion.Although the credit of these successful operations was entirely due to
Gessi, it must not be supposed that General Gordon took no part in
controlling them; but, for the sake of clearness, it seemed advisable
to narrate the history of the campaign against Suleiman without a
break.Early in 1879, when Gessi, after obtaining some successes, had
been reduced to inaction from the want of ammunition, Gordon's anxiety
became so great on his account that he determined to assume the
command in person.His main object was to afford relief to Gessi by
taking the field in Darfour, and putting down the rebels in that
province, who were on the point of throwing in their lot with
Suleiman.Gordon determined therefore to march on Shaka, the old
headquarters of Zebehr and his son.On his march he rescued several
slave caravans, but he saw that the suppression of the slave trade was
not popular, and the contradictory character of the law and his
instructions placed him in much embarrassment.Still, he saw clearly
that Darfour was the true heart of the slave trade, as the supply from
Inner Africa had to pass through it to Egypt, and he thought that a
solution might be found for the difficulty by requiring every one of
the inhabitants to have a permission of residence, and every traveller
a passport for himself and his followers.But neither time nor the
conditions of his post allowed of his carrying out this suggestion.It
remains, however, a simple practical measure to be borne in mind when
the solution of the slave difficulty is taken finally in hand by a
Government in earnest on the subject, and powerful enough to see its
orders enforced.General Gordon reached Shaka on 7th April, and at once issued a notice
to the slave-dealers to quit that advantageous station.He also sent
forward reinforcements of men and stores to Gessi, but in a few days
they returned, with a message from Gessi that he had received enough
powder from his own base on the Nile to renew the attack on Suleiman.Within one week of Gordon's arrival not a slave-dealer remained in
Shaka, and when envoys arrived from Suleiman, bearing protestations
that he had never been hostile to the Egyptian Government, he promptly
arrested them and sent them for trial by court-martial.Their guilt as
conspirers against the Khedive was easily proved, and they were shot.Their fate was fully deserved, but Gordon would have spared their
lives if Suleiman had not himself slain so many hostages and helpless
captives.Gordon's final operations for the suppression of the slave trade in
Darfour, carried on while Gessi was engaged in his last struggle with
Suleiman, resulted in the release of several thousand slaves, and the
dispersal and disarmament of nearly 500 slave-dealers.In one week he
rescued as many as 500 slaves, and he began to feel, as he said, that
he had at last reached the heart of the evil.But while these final successes were being achieved, he was recalled
by telegraph to Cairo, where events had reached a crisis, and the days
of Ismail as Khedive were numbered.It may have been the instinct of
despair that led that Prince to appeal again to Gordon, but the
Darfour rebellion was too grave to allow of his departure before it
had been suppressed; and on the 1st July he received a telegram from
the Minister Cherif, calling on him to proclaim throughout the Soudan
Tewfik Pasha as Khedive.The change did not affect him in the least,
he wrote, for not merely had his personal feelings towards Ismail
changed after he threw him over at Cairo, but he had found out the
futility of writing to him on any subject connected with the Soudan,
and with this knowledge had come a feeling of personal indifference.On his return to Khartoum, he received tidings of the execution of
Suleiman, and also of the death of the Darfourian Sultan, Haroun, so
that he felt justified in assuming that complete tranquillity had
settled down on the scene of war.The subsequent capture and execution
of Abdulgassin proved this view to be well founded, for, with the
exception of Rabi, who escaped to Borgu, he was the last of Zebehr's
chief lieutenants.The shot that killed that brigand, the very man who
shed the child's blood to consecrate the standard, was the last fired
under Gordon's orders in the Soudan.If the slave trade was then not
absolutely dead, it was doomed so long as the Egyptian authorities
pursued an active repressive policy such as their great English
representative had enforced.The military confederacy of Zebehr, which
had at one time alarmed the Khedive in his palace at Cairo, had been
broken up.The authority of the Khartoum Governor-General had been
made supreme.As Gordon said, on travelling down from Khartoum in
August 1879, "Not a man could lift his hand without my leave
throughout the whole extent of the Soudan."General Gordon reached Cairo on 23rd August, with the full intention
of retiring from the Egyptian service; but before he could do so there
remained the still unsolved Abyssinian difficulty, which had formed
part of his original mission.He therefore yielded to the request of
the Khedive to proceed on a special mission to the Court of King John,
then ruling that inaccessible and mysterious kingdom, and one week
after his arrival at Cairo he was steaming down the Red Sea to
Massowah.His instructions were contained in a letter from Tewfik
Pasha to himself.After proclaiming his pacific intentions, the
Khedive exhorted him "to maintain the rights of Egypt, to preserve
intact the frontiers of the State, without being compelled to make any
restitution to Abyssinia, and to prevent henceforth every encroachment
or other act of aggression in the interests of both countries."In order to explain the exact position of affairs in Abyssinia at this
period, a brief summary must be given of events between Gordon's first
overtures to King John in March 1877, and his taking up the matter
finally in August 1879.As explained at the beginning of this chapter,
those overtures came to nothing, because King John was called away to
engage in hostilities with Menelik, King of Shoa, and now himself
Negus, or Emperor of Abyssinia.In the autumn of the earlier year King
John wrote Gordon a very civil letter, calling him a Christian and a
brother, but containing nothing definite, and ending with the
assertion that "all the world knows the Abyssinian frontier."Soon
after this Walad el Michael recommenced his raids on the border, and
when he obtained some success, which he owed to the assistance of one
of Gordon's own subordinates, given while Gordon was making himself
responsible for his good conduct, he was congratulated by the Egyptian
War Minister, and urged to prosecute the conquest of Abyssinia.Instead of attempting the impossible, he very wisely came to terms
with King John, who, influenced perhaps by Gordon's advice, or more
probably by his own necessities through the war with Menelik, accepted
Michael's promises to respect the frontier.Michael went to the King's
camp to make his submission in due form, and in the spring of 1879 it
became known that he and the Abyssinian General (Ras Alula) were
planning an invasion of Egyptian territory.Fortunately King John was
more peacefully disposed, and still seemed anxious to come to an
arrangement with General Gordon.In January 1879 the King wrote Gordon a letter, saying that he hoped
to see him soon, and he also sent an envoy to discuss matters.The
Abyssinian stated very clearly that his master would not treat with
the Khedive, on account of the way he had subjected his envoys at
Cairo to insult and injury; but that he would negotiate with Gordon,
whom he persisted in styling the "Sultan of the Soudan."King John
wanted a port, the restoration of Bogos, and an Abouna or Coptic
Archbishop from Alexandria, to crown him in full accordance with
Abyssinian ritual.Gordon replied a port was impossible, but that he
should have a Consul and facilities for traffic at Massowah; that the
territory claimed was of no value, and that he certainly should have
an Abouna.He also undertook to do his best to induce the British
Government to restore to King John the crown of King Theodore, which
had been carried off after the fall of Magdala.The envoy then
returned to Abyssinia, and nothing further took place until Gordon's
departure for Massowah in August, when the rumoured plans of Michael
and Ras Alula were causing some alarm.On reaching Massowah on 6th September, Gordon found that the
Abyssinians were in virtual possession of Bogos, and that if the
Egyptian claims were to be asserted, it would be necessary to retake
it.The situation had, however, been slightly improved by the downfall
of Michael, whose treachery and covert hostility towards General
Gordon would probably have led to an act of violence.But he and Ras
Alula had had some quarrel, and the Abyssinian General had seized the
occasion to send Michael and his officers as prisoners to the camp of
King John.The chief obstacle to a satisfactory arrangement being
thus removed, General Gordon hastened to have an interview with Ras
Alula, and with this intention crossed the Abyssinian frontier, and
proceeded to his camp at Gura.After an interview and the presentation
of the Khedive's letter and his credentials, Gordon found that he was
practically a prisoner, and that nothing could be accomplished save by
direct negotiation with King John.He therefore offered to go to his
capital at Debra Tabor, near Gondar, if Ras Alula would promise to
refrain from attacking Egypt during his absence.This promise was
promptly given, and in a few days it was expanded into an armistice
for four months.After six weeks' journey accomplished on mules, and by the worst roads
in the country, as Ras Alula had expressly ordered, so that the
inaccessibility of the country might be made more evident, General
Gordon reached Debra Tabor on 27th October.He was at once received by
King John, but this first reception was of only a brief and formal
character.Two days later the chief audience was given at daybreak,
King John reciting his wrongs, and Gordon referring him to the
Khedive's letters, which had not been read.After looking at them, the
King burst out with a list of demands, culminating in the sum of
L2,000,000 or the port of Massowah.When he had finished, Gordon asked
him to put these demands on paper, to sign them with his seal, and to
give the Khedive six months to consider them and make a reply.This
King John promised to do on his return from some baths, whither he was
proceeding for the sake of his health.After a week's absence the King returned, and the negotiations were
resumed.But the King would not draw up his demands, which he realised
were excessive, and when he found that Gordon remained firm in his
intention to uphold the rights of the Khedive, the Abyssinian became
offended and rude, and told Gordon to go.Gordon did not require to be
told this twice, and an hour afterwards had begun his march, intending
to proceed by Galabat to Khartoum.A messenger was sent after him with
a letter from the King to the Khedive, which on translating read as
follows: "I have received the letters you sent me by _that man_ (a
term of contempt).I will not make a secret peace with you.If you
want peace, ask the Sultans of Europe."With a potentate so vague and
so exacting it was impossible to attain any satisfactory result, and
therefore Gordon was not sorry to depart.After nearly a fortnight's
travelling, he and his small party had reached the very borders of the
Soudan, their Abyssinian escort having returned, when a band of
Abyssinians, owning allegiance to Ras Arya, swooped down on them, and
carried them off to the village of that chief, who was the King's
uncle.The motive of this step is not clear, for Ras Arya declared that he
was at feud with the King, and that he would willingly help the
Egyptians to conquer the country.He however went on to explain that
the seizure of Gordon's party was due to the King's order that it
should not be allowed to return to Egypt by any other route than that
through Massowah.Unfortunately, the step seemed so full of menace that as a precaution
Gordon felt compelled to destroy the private journal he had kept
during his visit, as well as some valuable maps and plans.After
leaving the district of this prince, Gordon and his small party had to
make their way as best they could to get out of the country, only
making their way at all by a lavish payment of money--this journey
alone costing L1400--and by submitting to be bullied and insulted by
every one with the least shadow of authority.At last Massowah was
reached in safety, and every one was glad, because reports had become
rife as to King John's changed attitude towards Gordon, and the danger
to which he was exposed.But the Khedive was too much occupied to
attend to these matters, or to comply with Gordon's request to send a
regiment and a man-of-war to Massowah, as soon as the Abyssinian
despot made him to all intents and purposes a prisoner.The neglect to
make that demonstration not only increased the very considerable
personal danger in which Gordon was placed during the whole of his
mission, but it also exposed Massowah to the risk of capture if the
Abyssinians had resolved to attack it.The impressions General Gordon formed of the country were extremely
unfavourable.The King was cruel and avaricious beyond all belief, and
in his opinion fast going mad.The country was far less advanced than
he had thought.The people were greedy, unattractive, and quarrelsome.But he detected their military qualities, and some of the merits of
their organisation."They are," he wrote, "a race of warriors, hardy,
and, though utterly undisciplined, religious fanatics.I have seen
many peoples, but I never met with a more fierce, savage set than
these.The King said he could beat united Europe, except Russia."The closing incidents of Gordon's tenure of the post of
Governor-General of the Soudan have now to be given, and they were not
characterised by that spirit of justice, to say nothing of generosity,
which his splendid services and complete loyalty to the Khedive's
Government demanded.During his mission into Abyssinia his natural
demands for support were completely ignored, and he was left to
whatever fate might befall him.When he succeeded in extricating
himself from that perilous position, he found that the Khedive was so
annoyed at his inability to exact from his truculent neighbour a
treaty without any accompanying concessions, that he paid no
attention to him, and seized the opportunity to hasten the close of
his appointment by wilfully perverting the sense of several
confidential suggestions made to his Government.The plain explanation
of these miserable intrigues was that the official class at Cairo,
seeing that Gordon had alienated the sympathy and support of the
British Foreign Office and its representatives by his staunch and
outspoken defence of Ismail in 1878, realised that the moment had come
to terminate his, to them, always hateful Dictatorship in the Soudan.While the Cairo papers were allowed to couple the term "mad" with his
name, the Ministers went so far as to denounce his propositions as
inconsistent.One of these Ministers had been Gordon's enemy for
years; another had been banished by him from Khartoum for cruelty;
they were one and all sympathetic to the very order of things which
Gordon had destroyed, and which, as long as he retained power, would
never be revived.What wonder that they should snatch the favourable
opportunity of precipitating the downfall of the man they had so long
feared!But it was neither creditable nor politic for the
representatives of England to stand by while these schemes were
executed to the detraction of the man who had then given six years'
disinterested and laborious effort to the regeneration of the Soudan
and the suppression of the slave trade.When Gordon discovered that his secret representations, sent in cipher
for the information of the Government, were given to the Press with a
perverted meaning and hostile criticism, he hastened to Cairo.He
requested an immediate interview with Tewfik, who excused himself for
what had been done by his Ministers on the ground of his youth; but
General Gordon read the whole situation at a glance, and at once sent
in his resignation, which was accepted.It is not probable that, under
any circumstances, he would have been induced to return to the Soudan,
where his work seemed done, but he certainly was willing to make
another attempt to settle the Abyssinian difficulty.Without the
Khedive's support, and looked at askance by his own countrymen in the
Delta, called mad on this side and denounced as inconsistent on the
other, no good result could have ensued, and therefore he turned his
back on the scene of his long labours without a sigh, and this time
even without regret.The state of his health was such that rest, change of scene, and the
discontinuance of all mental effort were imperatively necessary, in
the opinion of his doctor, if a complete collapse of mental and
physical power was to be avoided.He was quite a wreck, and was
showing all the effects of protracted labour, the climate, and
improper food.Humanly speaking, his departure from Egypt was only
made in time to save his life, and therefore there was some
compensation in the fact that it was hastened by official jealousy and
animosity.But it seems very extraordinary that, considering the magnitude of the
task he had performed single-handed in the Soudan, and the way he had
done it with a complete disregard of all selfish interest, he should
have been allowed to lay down his appointment without any
manifestation of honour or respect from those he had served so long
and so well.It was
reflected among the English and other European officials, who
pronounced Gordon unpractical and peculiar, while in their hearts they
only feared his candour and bluntness.But even public opinion at
home, as reflected in the Press, seemed singularly blind to the fresh
claim he had established on the admiration of the world.His China
campaigns had earned him ungrudging praise, and a fame which, but for
his own diffidence, would have carried him to the highest positions in
the British army.But his achievements in the Soudan, not less
remarkable in themselves, and obtained with far less help from others
than his triumph over the Taepings, roused no enthusiasm, and received
but scanty notice.The explanation of this difference is not far to
seek, and reveals the baser side of human nature.In Egypt he had hurt
many susceptibilities, and criticised the existing order of things.His propositions were drastic, and based on the exclusion of a costly
European _regime_ and the substitution of a native administration.Even his mode of suppressing the slave trade had been as original as
it was fearless.Exeter Hall could not resound with cheers for a man
who declared that he had bought slaves himself, and recognised the
rights of others in what are called human chattels, even although that
man had done more than any individual or any government to kill the
slave trade at its root.It was not until his remarkable mission to
Khartoum, only four years after he left Egypt, that public opinion
woke up to a sense of all he had done before, and realised, in its
full extent, the magnitude and the splendour of his work as
Governor-General of the Soudan.MINOR MISSIONS--INDIA AND CHINA.General Gordon arrived in London at the end of January 1880--having
lingered on his home journey in order to visit Rome--resolved as far
as he possibly could to take that period of rest which he had
thoroughly earned, and which he so much needed.But during these last
few years of his life he was to discover that the world would not
leave him undisturbed in the tranquillity he desired and sought.Everyone wished to see him usefully and prominently employed for his
country's good, and offers, suitable and not suitable to his character
and genius, were either made to him direct, or put forward in the
public Press as suggestions for the utilization of his experience and
energy in the treatment of various burning questions.His numerous
friends also wished to do him honour, and he found himself threatened
with being drawn into the vortex of London Society, for which he had
little inclination, and, at that time, not even the strength and
health.After this incident he left London on 29th February for Switzerland,
where he took up his residence at Lausanne, visiting _en route_ at
Brussels, Mr, afterwards Lord, Vivian, then Minister at the Belgian
Court, who had been Consul-General in Egypt during the financial
crisis episode.It is pleasant to find that that passage had, in this
case, left no ill-feeling behind it on either side, and that Gordon
promised to think over the advice Mrs Vivian gave him to get married
while he was staying at the Legation.His reply must not be taken as
of any serious import, and was meant to turn the subject.About the
same time he wrote in a private letter, "Wives!what a trial
you are to your husbands!From my experience married men have more or
less a cowed look."It was on this occasion that Gordon was first brought into contact
with the King of the Belgians, and had his attention drawn to the
prospect of suppressing the slave trade from the side of the Congo,
somewhat analogous to his own project of crushing it from Zanzibar.The following unpublished letter gives an amusing account of the
circumstances under which he first met King Leopold:--


                                   "HOTEL DE BELLE-VUE, BRUXELLES,
                                   "_Tuesday, 2nd March 1880_."I arrived here yesterday at 6 P.M., and found my baggage had not
     come on when I got to the hotel (having given orders about my
     boxes which were to arrive to-day at 9 A.M.).I found I was
     _detected_, and a huge card of His Majesty awaited me, inviting
     to dinner at 6.30 P.M.It was then 6.20 P.M.I wrote my excuses,
     telling the truth.It is now 9.30 A.M., and no
     baggage.King has just sent to say he will receive me at 11 A.M.I am obliged to say I cannot come if my baggage does not arrive."I picked up a small book here, the 'Souvenirs of Congress of
     Vienna,' in 1814 and 1815.It is a sad account of the festivities
     of that time.It shows how great people fought for invitations to
     the various parties, and how like a bomb fell the news of
     Napoleon's descent from Elba, and relates the end of some of the
     great men.The English great man, Castlereagh, cut his throat
     near Chislehurst; Alexander died mad, etc., etc.They are all in
     their 6 feet by 2 feet 6 inches.... Horrors, it is now 10.20
     A.M., and no baggage!King sent to say he will see me at 11 A.M.;
     remember, too, I have to dress, shave, etc., etc.10.30 A.M.--No
     baggage!!!10.48 A.M.--No baggage!Indirectly Mackinnon (late Sir William)
     is the sinner, for he evidently told the King I was coming.Napoleon said, 'The smallest trifles produce the greatest
     results.'12.30 P.M.--Got enclosed note from palace, and went to
     see the King--a very tall man with black beard.He was very
     civil, and I stayed with him for one and a half hours.He is
     quite at sea with his expedition (Congo), and I have to try and
     get him out of it.I have to go there to-morrow at 11.30 A.M.My
     baggage has come."During his stay at Lausanne his health improved, and he lost the
numbed feeling in his arms which had strengthened the impression that
he suffered from _angina pectoris_.This apprehension, although
retained until a very short period before his final departure from
England in 1884, was ultimately discovered to be baseless.With
restored health returned the old feeling of restlessness.After five
weeks he found it impossible to remain any longer in Lausanne.Again
he exclaims in his letters: "Inaction is terrible to me!"and on 9th
April he left that place for London.Yet, notwithstanding his desire to return to work, or rather his
feeling that he could not live in a state of inactivity, he refused
the first definite suggestion that was made to him of employment.While he was still at Lausanne, the Governor of Cape Colony sent the
following telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies:--"My
Ministers wish that the post of Commandant of the Colonial Forces
should be offered to Chinese Gordon."The reply to this telegram read
as follows:--"The command of the Colonial Forces would probably be
accepted by Chinese Gordon in the event of your Ministers desiring
that the offer of it should be made to him."The Cape authorities
requested that this offer might be made, and the War Office
accordingly telegraphed to him as follows: "Cape Government offer
command of Colonial Forces; supposed salary, L1500; your services
required early."Everyone seems to have taken it as a matter of course
that he would accept; but Gordon's reply was in the negative: "Thanks
for telegram just received; I do not feel inclined to accept an
appointment."His reasons for not accepting what seemed a desirable
post are not known.They were probably due to considerations of
health, although the doubt may have presented itself to his mind
whether he was qualified by character to work in harmony with the
Governor and Cabinet of any colony.He knew very well that all his
good work had been done in an independent and unfettered capacity, and
at the Cape he must have felt that, as nominal head of the forces, he
would have been fettered by red tape and local jealousies, and
rendered incapable of doing any good in an anomalous position.But
after events make it desirable to state and recollect the precise
circumstances of this first offer to him from the Cape Government.While at Lausanne, General Gordon's attention was much given to the
study of the Eastern Question, and I am not at all sure that the real
reason of his declining the Cape offer was not the hope and
expectation that he might be employed in connection with a subject
which he thoroughly understood and had very much at heart.He drew up
a memorandum on the Treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, which, for
clearness of statement, perfect grasp of a vital international
question, and prophetic vision, has never been surpassed among State
papers.Although written in March 1880, and in my possession a very
short time afterwards, I was not permitted to publish it until
September 1885, when it appeared in the _Times_ of the 24th of that
month.Its remarkable character was at once appreciated by public men,
and Sir William Harcourt, speaking in the House four days later,
testified to the extraordinary foresight with which "poor Gordon"
diagnosed the case of Europe's sick man.I quote here this memorandum
in its integrity:--

     "The Powers of Europe assembled at Constantinople, and
     recommended certain reforms to Turkey.Turkey refused to accede
     to these terms, the Powers withdrew, and deliberated.Not being
     able to come to a decision, Russia undertook, on her own
     responsibility, to enforce them.England acquiesced, provided
     that her own interests were not interfered with.The
     Russo-Turkish War occurred, during which time England, in various
     ways, gave the Turks reason to believe that she would eventually
     come to their assistance.This may be disputed, but I refer to
     the authorities in Constantinople whether the Turks were not
     under the impression during the war _that England would help
     them, and also save them, from any serious loss eventually_.England, therefore, provided this is true, did encourage Turkey
     in her resistance."Then came the Treaty of San Stephano.It was drawn up with the
     intention of finishing off the rule of Turkey in Europe--there
     was no disguise about it; but I think that, looking at that
     treaty from a Russian point of view, it was a very bad one for
     Russia.Russia, by her own act, had trapped herself."By it (the Treaty of San Stephano) Russia had created a huge
     kingdom, or State, south of the Danube, with a port.This new
     Bulgarian State, being fully satisfied, would have nothing more
     to desire from Russia, but would have sought, by alliance with
     other Powers, to keep what she (Bulgaria) possessed, and would
     have feared Russia more than any other Power.Having a seaport,
     she would have leant on England and France.Being independent of
     Turkey, she would wish to be on good terms with her."Therefore I maintain, that _once_ the Russo-Turkish War had been
     permitted, no greater obstacle could have been presented to
     Russia than the maintenance of this united Bulgarian State, and I
     believe that the Russians felt this as well."I do not go into the question of the Asia Minor acquisitions by
     Russia, for, to all intents and purposes, the two treaties are
     alike.By both treaties Russia possesses the strategical points
     of the country, and though by the Berlin Treaty Russia gave up
     the strip south of Ararat, and thus does not hold the road to
     Persia, yet she stretches along this strip, and is only distant
     two days' march from the road, the value of which is merely
     commercial."By both treaties Russia obtained Batoum and the war-like tribes
     around it.Though the _only port_ on the Black Sea between Kertch
     and Sinope, a distance of 1000 miles, its acquisition by Russia
     was never contested.It was said to be a worthless
     possession--'grapes were sour.'"I now come to the changes made in the San Stephano Treaty (which
     was undoubtedly, and was intended to be, the _coup de grace_ to
     Turkish rule in Europe) by the Treaty of Berlin."By the division of the two Bulgarias we prolonged, without
     alleviating, the agony of Turkey in Europe; we repaired the great
     mistake of Russia, from a Russian point of view, in making one
     great State of Bulgaria.We stipulated that Turkish troops, with
     a hostile Bulgaria to the north, and a hostile Roumelia to the
     south, should occupy the Balkans.I leave military men, or any
     men of sense, to consider this step.We restored Russia to her
     place, as the protector of these lands, which she had by the
     Treaty of San Stephano given up.We have left the wishes of
     Bulgarians unsatisfied, and the countries unquiet.We have forced
     them to look to Russia more than to us and France, and we have
     lost their sympathies.It is not doubted that ere
     long the two States will be united.If Moldavia and Wallachia
     laughed at the Congress of Paris, and united while it (the
     Congress) was in session at Paris, is it likely Bulgaria will
     wait long, or hesitate to unite with Roumelia, because Europe
     does not wish it?"Therefore the union of the two States is certain, only it is to
     be regretted that this union will give just the chance Russia
     wants to interfere again; and though, when the union takes place,
     I believe Russia will repent it, still it will always be to
     Russia that they will look till the union is accomplished."I suppose the Turks are capable of appreciating what they gained
     by the Treaty of Berlin._They were fully aware that the Treaty
     of San Stephano was their_ coup de grace.But the Treaty of
     Berlin was supposed to be beneficial to them.By it Turkey
     lost _not only Bulgaria_ and _Roumelia_ (for she has virtually
     lost it), but _Bosnia_ and _Herzegovina_, while she gained the
     utterly impossible advantage of occupying the Balkans, with a
     hostile nation to north and south."I therefore maintain that the Treaty of Berlin did no good to
     Turkey, but infinite harm to Europe."I will now go on to the Cyprus convention, and say a few words
     on the bag-and-baggage policy.Turkey and Egypt are governed by a
     ring of Pashas, most of them Circassians, and who are perfect
     foreigners in Turkey.They are, for the greater part, men who,
     when boys, have been bought at prices varying from L50 to L70,
     and who, brought up in the harems, have been pushed on by their
     purchasers from one grade to another.Some have been dancing boys
     and drummers, like Riaz and Ismail Eyoub of Egypt.I understand
     by bag-and-baggage policy the getting rid of, say, two hundred
     Pashas of this sort in Turkey, and sixty Pashas in Egypt.These
     men have not the least interest in the welfare of the countries;
     they are aliens and adventurers, they are hated by the
     respectable inhabitants of Turkey and Egypt, and they must be got
     rid of."Armenia is lost; it is no use thinking of reforms in it.The
     Russians virtually possess it; the sooner we recognise this fact
     the better.Study existing facts, and decide on a
     definite line of policy, and follow it through.Russia, having a
     definite line of policy, is strong; we have not one, and are weak
     and vacillating.'A double-minded man is unstable in all his
     ways.'"Supposing such a line of policy as follows was decided upon and
     followed up, it would be better than the worries of the last four
     years:--

     "1.The union of Bulgaria and Roumelia, with a port.Constantinople, a State, under European guarantees.Increase of Montenegro, and Italy, on that coast.Annexation of Egypt by England, _either directly or by having
     paramount and entire authority_.Annexation of Syria by France--ditto--ditto--ditto.(By this
     means France would be as interested in stopping Russian progress
     as England is.)Italy to be allowed to extend towards Abyssinia.Re-establishment of the Turkish Constitution, and the
     establishment of a similar one in Egypt (these Constitutions, if
     not interfered with, would soon rid Turkey and Egypt of their
     parasite Pashas)."I daresay this programme could be improved, but it has the
     advantage of being _definite_, and a definite policy, however
     imperfect, is better than an unstable or hand-to-mouth policy."I would not press these points at once; I would keep them in
     view, and let events work themselves out."I believe, in time, this programme could be worked out without a
     shot being fired."I believe it would be quite possible to come to terms with
     Russia on these questions; I do not think she has sailed under
     false colours when her acts and words are generally considered.She is the avowed enemy of Turkey, she has not disguised it.Have
     _we_ been the friend of Turkey?How many years have elapsed
     between the Crimean war and the Russo-Turkish war?What did we do
     to press Turkey to carry out reforms (as promised by the Treaty
     of 1856) in those years?_Absolutely nothing._

     "What has to be done to prevent the inevitable crash of the
     Turkish Empire which is impending, imperilling the peace of the
     world, is _the re-establishment of the Constitution of Midhat,
     and its maintenance, in spite of the Sultan_.By this means, when
     the Sultan and the ring of Pashas fall, there would still exist
     the chambers of representatives of the provinces, who would carry
     on the Government for a time, and at any rate prevent the foreign
     occupation of Constantinople, or any disorders there, incident on
     the exit of the Sultan and his Pashas."Having partially explained how General Gordon declined one post for
which he appeared to be well suited, I have to describe how it was
that he accepted another for which neither by training nor by
character was he in the least degree fitted.The exact train of
trifling circumstances that led up to the proposal that Gordon should
accompany the newly-appointed Viceroy, the Marquis of Ripon, to India
cannot be traced, because it is impossible to assign to each its
correct importance.But it may be said generally, that the prevalent
idea was that Lord Ripon was going out to the East on a great mission
of reform, and some one suggested that the character of that mission
would be raised in the eyes of the public if so well known a
philanthropist as Gordon, whose views on all subjects were free from
official bias, could be associated with it.I do not know whether the
idea originated with Sir Bruce Seton, Lord Ripon's secretary, while at
the War Office, but in any case that gentleman first broached the
proposition to Sir Henry Gordon, the eldest brother of General Gordon.Sir Henry not merely did not repel the suggestion, but he consented to
put it before his brother and to support it.For his responsibility in
this affair Sir Henry afterwards took the fullest and frankest blame
on himself for his "bad advice."When the matter was put before
General Gordon he did not reject it, as might have been expected, but
whether from his desire to return to active employment, or biassed by
his brother's views in favour of the project, or merely from coming to
a decision without reflection, he made up his mind at once to accept
the offer, and the official announcement of the appointment was made
on 1st May, with the additional statement that his departure would
take place without delay, as he was to sail with Lord Ripon on the
14th of that month.It was after his acceptance of this post, and not some months before,
as has been erroneously stated, that General Gordon had an interview
with the Prince of Wales under circumstances that may be described.The Prince gave a large dinner-party to Lord Ripon before his
departure for India, and Gordon was invited.He declined the
invitation, and also declined to give any reason for doing so.The
Prince of Wales, with his unfailing tact and the genuine kindness with
which he always makes allowance for such little breaches of what ought
to be done, at least in the cases of exceptional persons like Gordon,
sent him a message: "If you won't dine with me, will you come and see
me next Sunday afternoon?"Gordon went, and had a very interesting
conversation with the Prince, and in the middle of it the Princess
came into the room, and then the Princesses, her daughters, who said
they would "like to shake hands with Colonel Gordon."Before even the departure Gordon realised he had made a mistake, and
if there had been any way out of the dilemma he would not have been
slow to take it.As there was not, he fell back on the hope that he
might be able to discharge his uncongenial duties for a brief period,
and then seek some convenient opportunity of retiring.But as to his
own real views of his mistake, and of his unfitness for the post,
there never was any doubt, and they found expression when, in the
midst of a family gathering, he exclaimed: "Up to this I have been an
independent comet, now I shall be a chained satellite."The same opinion found expression in a letter he wrote to Sir Halliday
Macartney an hour before he went to Charing Cross:--

     "MY DEAR MACARTNEY,--You will be surprised to hear that I have
     accepted the Private Secretaryship to Lord Ripon, and that I am
     just off to Charing Cross.I am afraid that I have decided in
     haste, to repent at leisure.Good-bye.--Yours,

                                             C. G.His own views on this affair were set forth in the following words:--

"Men at times, owing to the mysteries of Providence, form judgments
which they afterwards repent of.Nothing could have
exceeded the kindness and consideration with which Lord Ripon has
treated me.I have never met anyone with whom I could have felt
greater sympathy in the arduous task he has undertaken."And again, writing at greater length to his brother, he explains what
took place in the following letter:--

     "In a moment of weakness I took the appointment of Private
     Secretary to Lord Ripon, the new Governor-General of India.No
     sooner had I landed at Bombay than I saw that in my irresponsible
     position I could not hope to do anything really to the purpose in
     the face of the vested interests out there.Seeing this, and
     seeing, moreover, that my views were so diametrically opposed to
     those of the official classes, I resigned.Lord Ripon's position
     was certainly a great consideration with me.It was assumed by
     some that my views of the state of affairs were the Viceroy's,
     and thus I felt that I should do him harm by staying with him.We
     parted perfect friends.The brusqueness of my leaving was
     unavoidable, inasmuch as my stay would have put me into the
     possession of secrets of State that--considering my decision
     eventually to leave--I ought not to know.Certainly I might have
     stayed a month or two, had a pain in the hand, and gone quietly;
     but the whole duties were so distasteful that I felt, being
     pretty callous as to what the world says, that it was better to
     go at once."If a full explanation is sought of the reasons why Gordon repented of
his decision, and determined to leave an uncongenial position without
delay, it may be found in a consideration of the two following
circumstances.His views as to what he held to be the excessive
payment of English and other European servants in Asiatic countries
were not new, and had been often expressed.They were crystallised in
the phrase, "Why pay a man more at Simla than at Hongkong?"and had
formed the basis of his projected financial reform in Egypt in 1878,
and they often found expression in his correspondence.For instance,
in a letter to the present writer, he proposed that the loss accruing
from the abolition of the opium trade might be made good by reducing
officers' pay from Indian to Colonial allowances.With Gordon's
contempt for money, and the special circumstances that led to his not
wanting any considerable sum for his own moderate requirements and few
responsibilities, it is not surprising that he held these views; but
no practical statesman could have attempted to carry them out.During
the voyage to India the perception that it would be impossible for
Lord Ripon to institute any special reorganisation on these lines led
him to decide that it would be best to give up a post he did not like,
and he wrote to his sister to this effect while at sea, with the
statement that it was arranged that he should leave in the following
September or October.He reached Bombay on the 28th of May, and his resignation was received
and accepted on the night of the 2nd June.What had happened in that
brief interval of a few days to make him precipitate matters?There is
absolutely no doubt, quite apart from the personal explanation given
by General Gordon, both verbally and in writing, to myself, that the
determining cause was the incident relating to Yakoob Khan.That Afghan chief had been proclaimed and accepted as Ameer after the
death of his father, the Ameer Shere Ali.In that capacity he had
signed the Treaty of Gandamak, and received Sir Louis Cavagnari as
British agent at his capital.When the outbreak occurred at Cabul, on
1st September, and Cavagnari and the whole of the mission were
murdered, it was generally believed that the most guilty person was
Yakoob Khan.On the advance of General Roberts, Yakoob Khan took the
first opportunity of making his escape from his compatriots and
joining the English camp.This voluntary act seemed to justify a doubt
as to his guilt, but a Court of Inquiry was appointed to ascertain the
facts.Mary travelled to the office.The bias of the leading members of that Court was
unquestionably hostile to Yakoob, or rather it would be more accurate
to say that they were bent on finding the highest possible personage
guilty.They were appointed to inquire, not to sentence.Yet they
found Yakoob guilty, and they sent a vast mass of evidence to the
Foreign Department then at Calcutta.The experts of the Foreign
Department examined that evidence.They pronounced it "rubbish," and
Lord Lytton was obliged to send Mr (afterwards Sir) Lepel Griffin, an
able member of the Indian Civil Service, specially versed in frontier
politics, to act as Political Officer with the force in Afghanistan,
so that no blunders of this kind might be re-enacted.But nothing was done either to rehabilitate Yakoob's character or to
negotiate with him for the restoration of a central authority in
Afghanistan.Any other suitable candidate for the Ameership failing to
present himself, the present ruler, Abdurrahman, being then, and
indeed until the eve of the catastrophe at Maiwand, on 27th July 1880,
an adventurous pretender without any strong following, Lord Lytton had
been negotiating on the lines of a division of Afghanistan into three
or more provinces.That policy, of which the inner history has still
to be written, had a great deal more to be said in its favour than
would now be admitted, and only the unexpected genius and success of
Abdurrahman has made the contrary policy that was pursued appear the
acme of sound sense and high statesmanship.When Lord Ripon reached
Bombay at the end of May, the fate of Afghanistan was still in the
crucible.Even Abdurrahman, who had received kind treatment in the
persons of his imprisoned family at Candahar from the English, was not
regarded as a factor of any great importance; while Ayoob, the least
known of all the chiefs, was deemed harmless only a few weeks before
he crossed the Helmund and defeated our troops in the only battle lost
during the war.But if none of the candidates inspired our authorities
with any confidence, they were resolute in excluding Yakoob Khan.Having been relieved from the heavier charge of murdering Cavagnari,
he was silently cast on the not less fatal one of being a madman.Such was the position of the question when Lord Ripon and his
secretary landed at Bombay.It was known that they would alter the
Afghan policy of the Conservative Government, and that, as far as
possible, they would revert to the Lawrentian policy of ignoring the
region beyond the passes.But it was not known that they had any
designs about Yakoob Khan, and this was the bomb they fired on arrival
into the camp of Indian officialdom.The first despatch written by the new secretary was to the Foreign
Department, to the effect that Lord Ripon intended to commence
negotiations with the captive Yakoob, and Mr (now Sir) Mortimer
Durand, then assistant secretary in that branch of the service, was at
once sent from Simla to remonstrate against a proceeding which "would
stagger every one in India."Lord Ripon was influenced by these
representations, and agreed to at least suspend his overtures to
Yakoob Khan, but his secretary was not convinced by either the
arguments or the facts of the Indian Foreign Department.He still
considered that Afghan prince the victim of political injustice, and
also that he was the best candidate for the throne of Cabul.But he
also saw very clearly from this passage of arms with the official
classes that he would never be able to work in harmony with men who
were above and before all bureaucrats, and with commendable promptness
he seized the opportunity to resign a post which he thoroughly
detested.What he thought on the subject of Yakoob Khan is fully set
forth in the following memorandum drawn up as a note to my biography
of that interesting and ill-starred prince in "Central Asian
Portraits."Whether Gordon was right or wrong in his views about
Yakoob Khan is a matter of no very great importance.The incident is
only noteworthy as marking the conclusion of his brief secretarial
experience, and as showing the hopefulness of a man who thought that
he could make the all-powerful administrative system of India decide a
political question on principles of abstract justice.The practical
comment on such sanguine theories was furnished by Mr Durand being
appointed acting private secretary on Gordon's resignation.General Gordon's memorandum read as follows:--

     "Yacoob was accused of concealing letters from the Russian
     Government, and of entering into an alliance with the Rajah of
     Cashmere to form a Triple Alliance.Where are these letters or
     proof of this intention?"Yacoob came out to Roberts of his own free will.It was nothing remarkable that he was visited by an
     Afghan leader, although it was deemed evidence of a treacherous
     intention.Roberts and Cavagnari made the Treaty of Gandamak.It
     is absurd to say Yacoob wanted an European Resident.It is
     against all reason to say he did.He was coerced into taking
     one.He was imprisoned, and a Court of Enquiry was held on him,
     composed of the President Macgregor, who was chief of the staff
     to the man who made the Treaty, by which Cavagnari went to Cabul,
     and who had imprisoned Yacoob.This Court of Enquiry asked for
     evidence concerning a man in prison, which is in eyes of Asiatics
     equivalent to being already condemned.This Court accumulated
     evidence, utterly worthless in any court of justice, as will be
     seen if ever published.This Court of _Enquiry_ found him guilty
     and sentenced him to exile.If the
     secret papers are published, it would be seen that the despatches
     from the Cabulese chiefs were couched in fair terms.They did not
     want to fight the English.Yacoob's
     defence is splendid.He says in it: 'If I had been guilty, would
     I not have escaped to Herat, whereas I put myself in your hands?'The following questions arise from this Court of Enquiry.Who
     fired first shot from the Residency?Was the conduct of Cavagnari
     and his people discreet in a fanatical city?Were not those who
     forced Cavagnari on Yacoob against his protest equally
     responsible with him?Yacoob was weak and timid in a critical
     moment, and he failed, but he did not incite this revolt.It was
     altogether against his interests to do so.What was the
     consequence of his unjust exile?Why, all the trouble which
     happened since that date.Afghanistan was quiet till we took her
     ruler away.This mistake has cost
     L10,000,000, all from efforts to go on with an injustice.The
     Romans before their wars invoked all misery on themselves before
     the Goddess Nemesis if their war was unjust.We did not invoke
     her, but she followed us.Between the time that the Tory
     Government went out, and the new Viceroy Ripon had landed at
     Bombay, Lytton forced the hand of the Liberal Government by
     entering into negotiations with Abdurrahman, and appointing the
     Vali at Candahar, so endeavouring to prevent justice to Yacoob.Stokes, Arbuthnot, and another member of Supreme Council all
     protested against the deposition of Yacoob, also Sir Neville
     Chamberlaine."Lest it should be thought that Gordon was alone in these opinions, I
append this statement, drawn up at the time by Sir Neville
Chamberlaine:--

     "An unprejudiced review of the circumstances surrounding the
     _emeute_ of September 1879 clearly indicates that the spontaneous
     and unpremeditated action of a discontented, undisciplined, and
     unpaid soldiery had not been planned, directed, or countenanced
     by the Ameer, his ministers, or his advisers.There is no
     evidence to prove or even to suspect that the mutiny of his
     soldiers was in any way not deplored by the Ameer, but was
     regarded by him with regret, dismay, and even terror.Fully
     conscious of the very grave misapprehensions and possible
     accusation of timidity and weakness on our part, I entertain,
     myself, very strong convictions that we should have first
     permitted and encouraged the Ameer to punish the mutinous
     soldiers and rioters implicated in the outrage before we
     ourselves interfered.The omission to adopt this course
     inevitably led to the action forced on the Ameer, which
     culminated in the forced resignation of his power and the total
     annihilation of the national government.The Ameer in thus
     resigning reserved to himself the right of seeking, when occasion
     offered, restoration to his heritage and its reversion to his
     heir.Nothing has occurred to justify the ignoring of these
     undeniable rights."Gordon's resignation was handed in to Lord Ripon on the night of the
2nd of June, the news appeared in the London papers of the 4th, and it
had one immediate consequence which no one could have foreseen.But
before referring to that matter I must make clear the heavy pecuniary
sacrifice his resignation of this post entailed upon Gordon.He repaid
every farthing of his expenses as to passage money, etc., to Lord
Ripon, which left him very much out of pocket.He wrote himself on the
subject: "All this Private Secretaryship and its consequent expenses
are all due to my not acting on my _own_ instinct.However, for the
future I will be wiser.... It was a living crucifixion.... I nearly
burst with the trammels.... A L100,000 a year would not have kept me
there.I resigned on 2 June, and never unpacked my official dress."The immediate consequence referred to was as follows: In the drawer of
Mr J. D. Campbell, at the office at Storey's Gate of the Chinese
Imperial Customs, had been lying for some little time the
following telegram for Colonel Gordon from Sir Robert Hart, the
Inspector-General of the Department in China:--

     "I am directed to invite you here (Peking).Please come and see
     for yourself.The opportunity of doing really useful work on a
     large scale ought not to be lost.Work, position, conditions, can
     all be arranged with yourself here to your satisfaction.Do take
     six months' leave and come."As Mr Campbell was aware of Gordon's absence in India, he had thought
it useless to forward the message, and it was not until the
resignation was announced that he did so.In dealing with this
intricate matter, which was complicated by extraneous considerations,
it is necessary to clear up point by point.When Gordon received the
message he at once concluded that the invitation came from his old
colleague Li Hung Chang, and accepted it on that assumption, which in
the end proved erroneous.It is desirable to state that since Gordon's
departure from China in 1865 at least one communication had passed
between these former associates in a great enterprise.The following
characteristic letter, dated Tientsin, 22nd March 1879, reached Gordon
while he was at Khartoum:--

     "DEAR SIR,--I am instructed by His Excellency the Grand
     Secretary, Li, to answer your esteemed favour, dated the 27th
     October 1878, from Khartoum, which was duly received.I am right
     glad to hear from you.It is now over fourteen years since we
     parted from each other.Although I have not written to you, but I
     often speak of you, and remember you with very great interest.The benefit you have conferred on China does not disappear with
     your person, but is felt throughout the regions in which you
     played so important and active a part.All those people bless you
     for the blessings of peace and prosperity which they now enjoy."Your achievements in Egypt are well known throughout the
     civilized world.I see often in the papers of your noble works on
     the Upper Nile.You are a man of ample resources, with which you
     suit yourself to any kind of emergency.My hope is that you may
     long be spared to improve the conditions of the people amongst
     whom your lot is cast.I am striving hard to advance my people to
     a higher state of development, and to unite both this and all
     other nations within the 'Four Seas' under one common
     brotherhood.To the several questions put in your note the
     following are the answers:--Kwoh Sung-Ling has retired from
     official life, and is now living at home.Yang Ta Jen died a
     great many years ago.Na Wang's adopted son is doing well, and is
     the colonel of a regiment, with 500 men under him.The Pa to'
     Chiaow Bridge, which you destroyed, was rebuilt very soon after
     you left China, and it is now in very good condition."Kwoh Ta jen, the Chinese Minister, wrote to me that he had the
     pleasure of seeing you in London.I wished I had been there also
     to see you; but the responsibilities of life are so distributed
     to different individuals in different parts of the world, that it
     is a wise economy of Providence that we are not all in the same
     spot."I wish you all manner of happiness and prosperity.With my
     highest regards,--I remain, yours very truly

               "(For LI HUNG CHANG),        TSENG LAISUN."Under the belief that Hart's telegram emanated from Li Hung Chang, and
inspired by loyalty to a friend in a difficulty, as well as by
affection for the Chinese people, whom in his own words he "liked best
next after his own," Gordon replied to this telegram in the following
message: "Inform Hart Gordon will leave for Shanghai first
opportunity.At that moment China seemed on the verge of war with Russia, in
consequence of the disinclination of the latter power to restore the
province of Kuldja, which she had occupied at the time of the
Mahommedan uprising in Central Asia.The Chinese official, Chung How,
who had signed an unpopular treaty at Livadia, had been sentenced to
death--the treaty itself had been repudiated--and hostilities were
even said to have commenced.The announcement that the Chinese
Government had invited Gordon to Peking, and that he had promptly
replied that he would come, was also interpreted as signifying the
resolve to carry matters with a high hand, and to show the world that
China was determined to obtain what she was entitled to.Those persons
who have a contemptuous disregard for dates went so far even as to
assert that Gordon had resigned because of the Chinese invitation.Never was there a clearer case of _post hoc, propter hoc_; but even
the officials at the War Office were suspicious in the matter, and
their attitude towards Gordon went near to precipitate the very
catastrophe they wanted to avoid.On the same day (8th June) as he telegraphed his reply to the Chinese
invitation, he telegraphed to Colonel Grant, Deputy Adjutant-General
for the Royal Engineers at the Horse Guards: "Obtain me leave until
end of the year; am invited to China; will not involve Government."Considering the position between China and Russia, and the concern of
the Russian press and Government at the report about Gordon, it is not
surprising that this request was not granted a ready approval.The
official reply came back: "Must state more specifically purpose and
position for and in which you go to China."To this Gordon sent the
following characteristic answer: "Am ignorant; will write from China
before the expiration of my leave."An answer like this savoured of
insubordination, and shows how deeply Gordon was hurt by the want of
confidence reposed in him.In saying this I disclaim all intention of
criticising the authorities, for whose view there was some reasonable
justification; but the line they took, while right enough for an
ordinary Colonel of Engineers, was not quite a considerate one in the
case of an officer of such an exceptional position and well-known
idiosyncrasies as "Chinese" Gordon.On that ground alone may it be
suggested that the blunt decision thus given in the final official
telegram--"Reasons insufficient; your going to China is not approved,"
was somewhat harsh.It was also impotent, for it rather made Gordon persist in carrying
out his resolve than deterred him from doing so.His reply was thus
worded: "Arrange retirement, commutation, or resignation of service;
ask Campbell reasons.My counsel, if asked, would be for peace, not
war.Gordon's mind was fully made up to go, even
if he had to sacrifice his commission.Without waiting for any further
communication he left Bombay.As he had insisted on repaying Lord
Ripon his passage-money from England to India which, owing to his
resignation, the Viceroy would otherwise have had to pay out of his
own pocket, Gordon was quite without funds, and he had to borrow the
sum required to defray his passage to China.But having made up his
mind, such trifling difficulties were not likely to deter him.He
sailed from Bombay, not merely under the displeasure of his superiors
and uncertain as to his own status, but also in that penniless
condition, which was not wholly out of place in his character of
knight-errant.But with that solid good sense, which so often
retrieved his reputation in the eyes of the world, he left behind him
the following public proclamation as to his mission and intentions.It
was at once a public explanation of his proceedings, and a declaration
of a pacific policy calculated to appease both official and Russian
irritation:

     "My fixed desire is to persuade the Chinese not to go to war with
     Russia, both in their own interests and for the sake of those of
     the world, especially those of England.In the event of war
     breaking out I cannot answer how I should act for the present,
     but I should ardently desire a speedy peace.It is my fixed
     desire, as I have said, to persuade the Chinese not to go to war
     with Russia.To me it appears that the question in dispute cannot
     be of such vital importance that an arrangement could not be come
     to by concessions upon both sides.Whether I succeed in being
     heard or not is not in my hands.I protest, however, at being
     regarded as one who wishes for war in any country, still less in
     China.Inclined as I am, with only a small degree of admiration
     for military exploits, I esteem it a far greater honour to
     promote peace than to gain any paltry honours in a wretched war."With that message to his official superiors, as well as to the world,
Gordon left Bombay on 13th June.His message of the day before saying,
"Consult Campbell," had induced the authorities at the Horse Guards to
make inquiries of that gentleman, who had no difficulty in satisfying
them that the course of events was exactly as has here been set forth,
and coupling that with Gordon's own declaration that he was for peace
not war, permission was granted to Gordon to do that which at all cost
he had determined to do.When he reached Ceylon he found this
telegram: "Leave granted on your engaging to take no military service
in China," and he somewhat too comprehensively, and it may even be
feared rashly if events had turned out otherwise, replied: "I will
take no military service in China: I would never embarrass the British
Government."Having thus got clear of the difficulties which beset him on the
threshold of his mission, Gordon had to prepare himself for those that
were inherent to the task he had taken up.He knew of old how averse
the Chinese are to take advice from any one, how they waste time in
fathoming motives, and how when they say a thing shall be done it is
never performed.Yet the memory of his former disinterested and
splendid service afforded a guarantee that if they would take advice
and listen to unflattering criticism from any one, that man was
Gordon.Still, from the most favourable point of view, the mission was
fraught with difficulty, and circumstances over which he had no
control, and of which he was even ignorant, added immensely to it.There is no doubt that Peking was at that moment the centre of
intrigues, not only between the different Chinese leaders, but also
among the representatives of the Foreign Powers.The secret history of
these transactions has still to be revealed, and as our Foreign Office
never gives up the private instructions it transmits to its
representatives, the full truth may never be recorded.But so far as
the British Government was concerned, its action was limited to giving
the Minister, Sir Thomas Wade, instructions to muzzle Gordon and
prevent his doing anything that wasn't strictly in accordance with
official etiquette and quite safe, or, in a word, to make him do
nothing.The late Sir Thomas Wade was a most excellent Chinese scholar
and estimable person in every way, but when he tried to do what the
British Government and the whole arrayed body of the Horse Guards,
from the Commander-in-Chief down to the Deputy-Adjutant General, had
failed to do, viz.to keep Gordon in leading strings, he egregiously
failed.Sir Thomas Wade went so far as to order Gordon to stay in the
British Legation, and to visit no one without his express permission.Gordon's reply was to ignore the British Legation and to never enter
its portals during the whole of his stay in China.That was one difficulty in the situation apart from the Russian
question, but it was not the greatest, and as it was the first
occasion on which European politics re-acted in a marked way on the
situation in China, such details as are ascertainable are well worth
recording at some length.There is no doubt that the Russian Government was very much disturbed
at what seemed an inevitable hostile collision with China.The
uncertain result of such a contest along an enormous land-frontier,
with which, at that time, Russia had very imperfect means of
communication, was the least cause of its disquietude.A war with
China signified to Russia something much more serious than this, viz.,
a breach of the policy of friendship to its vast neighbour, which it
had consistently pursued for two centuries, and which it will pursue
until it is ready to absorb, and then in the same friendly guise, its
share of China.Under these circumstances the Russian Government
looked round for every means of averting the catastrophe.It is
necessary to guard oneself from seeming to imply that Russia was in
any sense afraid, or doubtful as to the result of a war with China;
her sole motives were those of astute and far-seeing policy.Whether
the Russian Ambassador at Berlin mooted the matter to Prince
Bismarck, or whether that statesman, without inspiration, saw his
chance of doing Russia a good turn at no cost to himself is not
certain, but instructions were sent to Herr von Brandt, the German
Minister at Peking, a man of great energy, and in favour of bold
measures, to support the Peace Party in every way.He was exactly a
man after Prince Bismarck's own heart, prepared to go to any lengths
to attain his object, and fully persuaded that the end justifies the
means.Li Hung Chang, the
only prominent advocate of peace, was to rebel, march on Peking with
his Black Flag army, and establish a Government of his own.There is
no doubt whatever that this scheme was formed and impressed on Li Hung
Chang as the acme of wisdom.More than that, it was supported by two
other Foreign Ministers at Peking, with greater or less warmth, and
one of them was Sir Thomas Wade.These plots were dispelled by the
sound sense and candid but firm representations of Gordon.But for
him, as will be seen, there would have been a rebellion in the
country, and Li Hung Chang would now be either Emperor of China or a
mere instance of a subject who had lost his head in trying to be
supreme.Having thus explained the situation that awaited Gordon, it is
necessary to briefly trace his movements after leaving Ceylon.He
reached Hongkong on 2nd July, and not only stayed there for a day or
two as the guest of the Governor, Sir T. Pope Hennessey, but found
sufficient time to pay a flying visit to the Chinese city of Canton.Thence he proceeded to Shanghai and Chefoo.At the latter place he
found news, which opened his eyes to part of the situation, in a
letter from Sir Robert Hart, begging him to come direct to him at
Peking, and not to stop _en route_ to visit Li Hung Chang at Tientsin.As has been explained, Gordon went to China in the full belief that,
whatever names were used, it was his old colleague Li Hung Chang who
sent for him, and the very first definite information he received on
approaching the Chinese capital was that not Li, but persons whom by
inference were inimical to Li, had sent for him.The first question
that arises then was who was the real author of the invitation to
Gordon that bore the name of Hart.It cannot be answered, for Gordon
assured me that he himself did not know; but there is no doubt that it
formed part of the plot and counter-plot originated by the German
Minister, and responded to by those who were resolved, in the event of
Li's rebellion, to uphold the Dragon Throne.Sir Robert Hart is a man
of long-proved ability and address, who has rendered the Chinese
almost as signal service as did Gordon himself, and on this occasion
he was actuated by the highest possible motives, but it must be
recorded that his letter led to a temporary estrangement between
himself and Gordon, who I am happy to be able to state positively did
realise long afterwards that he and Hart were fighting in the same
camp, and had the same objects in view--only this was not apparent at
the time.Gordon went to China only because he thought Li Hung Chang
sent for him, but when he found that powerful persons were inciting
him to revolt, he became the first and most strenuous in his advice
against so imprudent and unpatriotic a measure.Sir Robert Hart knew
exactly what was being done by the German Minister.He wished to save
Gordon from being drawn into a dangerous and discreditable plot, and
also in the extreme eventuality to deprive any rebellion of the
support of Gordon's military genius.But without this perfect information, and for the best, as in the end
it proved, Gordon, hot with disappointment that the original summons
was not from Li Hung Chang, went straight to that statesman's yamen at
Tientsin, ignored Hart, and proclaimed that he had come as the friend
of the only man who had given any sign of an inclination to regenerate
China.He resided as long as he was in Northern China with Li Hung
Chang, whom he found being goaded towards high treason by persons who
had no regard for China's interests, and who thought only of the
attainment of their own selfish designs.The German Minister, thinking
that he had obtained an ally who would render the success of his own
plan certain, proposed that Gordon should put himself at the head of
Li's army, march on Peking, and depose the Emperor.Gordon's droll
comment on this is: "I told him I was equal to a good deal of
filibustering, but that this was beyond me, and that I did not think
there was the slightest chance of such a project succeeding, as Li had
not a sufficient following to give it any chance of success."He
recorded his views of the situation in the following note: "The only
thing that keeps me in China is Li Hung Chang's safety--if he were
safe I would not care--but some people are egging him on to rebel,
some to this, and some to that, and all appears in a helpless drift.There are parties at Peking who would drive the Chinese into war for
their own ends."Having measured the position and found it bristling
with unexpected difficulties and dangers, Gordon at once regretted the
promise he had given his own Government in the message from Ceylon.He
thought it was above all things necessary for him to have a free hand,
and he consequently sent the following telegram to the Horse Guards:
"I have seen Li Hung Chang, and he wishes me to stay with him.I
cannot desert China in her present crisis, and would be free to act
as I think fit.I therefore beg to resign my commission in Her
Majesty's Service."Having thus relieved, as he thought, his
Government of all responsibility for his acts--although they responded
to this message by accusing him of insubordination, and by instructing
Sir Thomas Wade to place him under moral arrest--Gordon threw himself
into the China difficulty with his usual ardour.Nothing more remained
to be done at Tientsin, where he had effectually checked the
pernicious counsel pressed on Li Hung Chang most strongly by the
German Minister, and in a minor degree by the representatives of
France and England.In order to influence the Central Government it
was necessary for him to proceed to Peking, and the following
unpublished letter graphically describes his views at the particular
moment:--

     "I am on my way to Peking.There are three parties--Li Hung Chang
     (1), the Court (2), the Literary Class (3).The two first are for
     peace, but dare not say it for fear of the third party.I have
     told Li that he, in alliance with the Court, must coerce the
     third party, and have written this to Li and to the Court Party.By so doing I put my head in jeopardy in going to Peking.I do
     not wish Li to act alone.It is not good he should do anything
     except support the Court Party morally.God will overrule for the
     best.If neither the Court Party nor Li can act, if these two
     remain and let things drift, then there will be a disastrous war,
     of which I shall not see the end.Having given up my commission, I have nothing to look for, and
     indeed I long for the quiet of the future.... If the third party
     hear of my recommendation before the Court Party acts, then I may
     be doomed to a quick exit at Peking.Li Hung Chang is a noble
     fellow, and worth giving one's life for; but he must not rebel
     and lose his good name.It is a sort of general election which is
     going on, but where heads are in gage."Writing to me some months later, General Gordon entered into various
matters relating to this period, and as the letter indirectly throws
light on what may be called the Li Hung Chang episode, I quote it
here, although somewhat out of its proper place:--

     "Thanks for your kind note.I send you the two papers which were
     made public in China, and through the Shen-pao some of it was
     sent over.Another paper of fifty-two articles I gave Li Hung
     Chang, but I purposely kept no copy of it, for it went into--

     "1.The contraband of salt and opium at Hongkong.The advantages of telegraphs and canals, not railways, which
     have ruined Egypt and Turkey by adding to the financial
     difficulties.The effeteness of the Chinese representatives abroad, etc.,
     etc., etc."I wrote as a Chinaman for the Chinese.I recommended Chinese
     merchants to do away with middle-men, and to have Government aid
     and encouragement to create houses or firms in London, etc.; to
     make their own cotton goods, etc.In fact, I wrote as a Chinaman.I see now and then symptoms that they are awake to the situation,
     for my object has been always to put myself into the skin of
     those I may be with, and I like these people as much--well, say
     nearly as much--as I like my countrymen."There are a lot of people in China who would egg on revolts of A
     and B. All this is wrong.I painted this
     picture to the Chinese of 1900: 'Who are those people hanging
     about with jinrickshas?''The Hongs of the European merchants,'
     etc., etc."People have asked me what I thought of the advance of China
     during the sixteen years I was absent.They looked superficially
     at the power military of China.You
     come, I must go; but I go on to say that the stride China has
     made in commerce is immense, and commerce and wealth are the
     power of nations, not the troops.Like the Chinese, I have a
     great contempt for military prowess.I admire
     administrators, not generals.A military Red-Button mandarin has
     to bow low to a Blue-Button civil mandarin, and rightly so to my
     mind."I wrote the other day to Li Hung Chang to protest against the
     railway from Ichang to Peking along the Grand Canal.In making it
     they would enter into no end of expenses, the coin would leave
     the country and they would not understand it, and would be
     fleeced by the financial cormorants of Great Britain.They can
     understand canals.Having arrived at Peking, Gordon was received in several councils by
Prince Chun, the father of the young Emperor and the recognised leader
of the War Party.The leading members of the Grand Council were also
present, and Gordon explained his views to them at length.In the
first place, he said, if there were war he would only stay to help
them on condition that they destroyed the suburbs of Peking, allowed
him to place the city in a proper state of defence, and removed the
Emperor and Court to a place of safety.When they expressed their
opinion that the Taku forts were impregnable, Gordon laughed, and said
they could be taken from the rear.The whole gist of his remarks was
that "they could not go to war," and when they still argued in the
opposite sense, and the interpreter refused to translate the harsh
epithets he applied to such august personages, he took the dictionary,
looked out the Chinese equivalent for "idiocy," and with his finger on
the word, placed it under the eyes of each member of the Council.The
end of this scene may be described in Gordon's own words: "I said make
peace, and wrote out the terms.They were, in all, five articles; the
only one they boggled at was the fifth, about the indemnity.They said
this was too hard and unjust.I said that might be, but what was the
use of talking about it?If a man demanded your money or your life,
you have only three courses open.You must either fight, call for
help, or give up your money.Now, as you cannot fight, it is useless
to call for help, since neither England nor France would stir a finger
to assist you.I believe these are the articles now under discussion
at St Petersburg, and the only one on which there is any question is
the fifth."This latter statement I may add, without going into the
question of the Marquis Tseng's negotiations in the Russian capital,
was perfectly correct.Gordon drew up several notes or memorandums for the information of the
Chinese Government.The first of these was mainly military, and the
following extracts will suffice:--

     "China's power lies in her numbers, in the quick moving of her
     troops, in the little baggage they require, and in their few
     wants.It is known that men armed with sword and spear can
     overcome the best regular troops equipped with breech-loading
     rifles, if the country is at all difficult and if the men with
     spears and swords outnumber their foe ten to one.If this is the
     case where men are armed with spears and swords, it will be much
     truer when those men are themselves armed with breech loaders.Her strength is in
     quiet movements, in cutting off trains of baggage, and in night
     attacks _not pushed home_--in a continuous worrying of her
     enemies.No artillery
     should be moved with the troops; it delays and impedes them.Infantry fire is the most fatal fire; guns make a noise far out
     of proportion to their value in war.If guns are taken into the
     field, troops cannot march faster than these guns.The degree of
     speed at which the guns can be carried dictates the speed at
     which the troops can march.As long as Peking is the centre of
     the Government of China, China can never go to war with any
     first-class power; it is too near the sea."The second memorandum was of greater importance and more general
application.In it he compressed the main heads of his advice into the
smallest possible space, and so far as it was at all feasible to treat
a vast and complicated subject within the limits of a simple and
practical scheme, he therein shows with the greatest clearness how the
regeneration of China might be brought about."In spite of the opinion of some foreigners, it will be generally
     acknowledged that the Chinese are contented and happy, that the
     country is rich and prosperous, and that the people are _au fond_
     united in their sentiments, and ardently desire to remain a
     nation.At constant intervals, however, the whole of this human
     hive is stirred by some dispute between the Pekin Government and
     some foreign Power; the Chinese people, proud of their ancient
     prestige, applaud the high tone taken up by the Pekin Government,
     crediting the Government with the power to support their strong
     words.This goes on for a time, when the Government gives in, and
     corresponding vexation is felt by the people.The recurrence of
     these disputes, the inevitable surrender ultimately of the Pekin
     Government, has the tendency of shaking the Chinese people's
     confidence in the Central Government.The Central Government
     appreciates the fact that, little by little, this prestige is
     being destroyed by their own actions among the Chinese people,
     each crisis then becomes more accentuated or difficult to
     surmount, as the Central Government know each concession is
     another nail in their coffin.The Central Government fear that
     the taking up of a spirited position by any pre-eminent Chinese
     would carry the Chinese people with him, and therefore the
     Central Government endeavour to keep up appearances, and to skirt
     the precipice of war as near as they possibly can, while never
     intending to enter into war."The Central Government residing in the extremity of the Middle
     Kingdom, away from the great influences which are now working in
     China, can never alter one iota from what they were years ago:
     they are being steadily left behind by the people they govern.They know this, and endeavour to stem these influences in all
     ways in their power, hoping to keep the people backward and in
     ignorance, and to <DW44> their progress to the same pace they
     themselves go, if it can be called a pace at all."It is therefore a maxim that 'no progress can be made by the
     Pekin Government.'To them any progress, whether slow or quick,
     is synonymous to slow or quick extinction, for they will never
     move."The term 'Pekin Government' is used advisedly, for if the
     Central Government were moved from Pekin into some province where
     the pulsations and aspirations of the Chinese people could have
     their legitimate effect, then the Central Government and the
     Chinese people, having a unison of thought, would work together."From what has been said above, it is maintained that, so long as
     the Central Government of China isolates itself from the Chinese
     people by residing aloof at Pekin, so long will the Chinese
     people have to remain passive under the humiliations which come
     upon them through the non-progressive and destructive disposition
     of their Government.These humiliations will be the chronic state
     of the Chinese people until the Central Government moves from
     Pekin and reunites itself to its subjects.John went back to the hallway.No army, no purchases
     of ironclad vessels will enable China to withstand a first-class
     Power so long as China keeps her queen bee at the entrance of her
     hive.There is, however, the probability that a proud people like
     the Chinese may sicken at this continual eating of humble pie,
     that the Pekin Government at some time, by skirting too closely
     the precipice of war may fall into it, and then that sequence may
     be anarchy and rebellion throughout the Middle Kingdom which may
     last for years and cause endless misery."It may be asked--How can the present state of things be altered?How can China maintain the high position that the wealth,
     industry, and innate goodness of the Chinese people entitle her
     to have among the nations of the world?Some may say by the
     revolt of this Chinaman or of that Chinaman.To me this seems
     most undesirable, for, in the first place, such action would not
     have the blessing of God, and, in the second, it would result in
     the country being plunged into civil war.The fair, upright, and
     open course for the Chinese people to take is to work, through
     the Press and by petitions, on the Central Government, and to
     request them to move from Pekin, and bring themselves thus more
     into unison with the Chinese people, and thus save that people
     the constant humiliations they have to put up with, owing to the
     seat of the Central Government being at Pekin.This
     recommendation would need no secret societies, no rebellion, no
     treason; if taken up and persevered in it must succeed, and not
     one life need be lost."The Central Government at Pekin could not answer the Chinese
     people except in the affirmative when the Chinese people say to
     the Central Government--'By your residing aloof from us in Pekin,
     where you are exposed to danger, you separate our interests from
     yours, and you bring on us humiliation, which we would never have
     to bear if you resided in the interior.Take our application into
     consideration, and grant our wishes.'"I have been kindly treated by the Central Pekin Government and
     by the Chinese people; it is for the welfare of both parties that
     I have written and signed this paper.I may have expressed myself
     too strongly with respect to the non-progressive nature of the
     Pekin Government, who may desire the welfare of the Middle
     Kingdom as ardently as any other Chinese, but as long as the
     Pekin Government allow themselves to be led and directed by those
     drones of the hive, the Censors, so long must the Pekin
     Government bear the blame earned by those drones in plunging
     China into difficulties.In the insect world the bees get rid of
     the drones in winter."There was yet a third memorandum of a confidential nature written to
Li Hung Chang himself, of which Gordon did not keep a copy, but he
referred to it in the letter written to myself which I have already
quoted.: the prevention of war
between Russia and China, and of a rebellion on the part of Li Hung
Chang under European advice and encouragement, Gordon left China
without any delay.When he reached Shanghai on 16th August he found
another official telegram awaiting him: "Leave cancelled, resignation
not accepted."As he had already taken his passage home he did not
reply, but when he reached Aden he telegraphed as follows: "You might
have trusted me.My passage from China was taken days before the
arrival of your telegram which states 'leave cancelled.'Do you insist
on rescinding the same?"The next day he received a reply granting him
nearly six months' leave, and with that message the question of his
alleged insubordination may be treated as finally settled.There can
be no doubt that among his many remarkable achievements not the least
creditable was this mission to China, when by downright candour, and
unswerving resolution in doing the right thing, he not merely
preserved peace, but baffled the intrigues of unscrupulous
diplomatists and selfish governments.With that incident closed Gordon's connection with China, the country
associated with his most brilliant feats of arms, but in concluding
this chapter it seems to me that I should do well to record some later
expressions of opinion on that subject.The following interesting
letter, written on the eve of the war between France and China in
1882, was published by the _New York Herald_:--

     "The Chinese in their affairs with foreign nations are fully
     aware of their peculiar position, and count with reason that a
     war with either France or another Power will bring them perforce
     allies outside of England.The only Power that could go to war
     with them with impunity is Russia, who can attack them by land.I
     used the following argument to them when I was there:--The
     present dynasty of China is a usurping one--the Mantchou.We may
     say that it exists by sufferance at Pekin, and nowhere else in
     the Empire.If you look at the map of China Pekin is at the
     extremity of the Empire and not a week's marching from the
     Russian frontier.A war with Russia would imply the capture of
     Pekin and the fall of the Mantchou dynasty, which would never
     dare to leave it, for if they did the Chinamen in the south would
     smite them.I said, 'If you go to war then move the Queen
     Bee--_i.e._ the Emperor--into the centre of China and then fight;
     if not, you must make peace.'The two Powers who can coerce China
     are Russia and England.Russia could march without much
     difficulty on Pekin.This much would not hurt trade, so England
     would not interfere.England could march to Taku and Pekin and no
     one would object, for she would occupy the Treaty Ports.But if
     France tried to do so England would object.Thus it is that China
     will only listen to Russia and England, and eventually she must
     fear Russia the most of all Powers, for she can never get over
     the danger of the land journey, but she might, by a great
     increase of her fleet, get over the fear of England.I say China,
     but I mean the Mantchou dynasty, for the Mantchous are despised
     by the Chinese.Any war with China would be for France expensive
     and dangerous, not from the Chinese forces, which would be soon
     mastered, but from the certainty of complications with England.As for the European population in China, write them down as
     identical with those in Egypt in all affairs.Their sole idea is,
     without any distinction of nationality, an increased power over
     China for their own trade and for opening up the country as they
     call it, and any war would be popular with them; so they will egg
     on any Power to make it.My idea is that no colonial or foreign
     community in a foreign land can properly, and for the general
     benefit of the world, consider the questions of that foreign
     State.The leading idea is how they will benefit themselves.The
     Isle of Bourbon or Reunion is the cause of the Madagascar war.It
     is egged on by the planters there, and to my idea they (the
     planters) want slaves for Madagascar.I have a very mean opinion
     of the views of any colonial or foreign community: though I own
     that they are powerful for evil.Who would dare to oppose the
     European colony in Egypt or China, and remain in those
     countries?"In a letter to myself, written about this time, very much the same
views are expressed:--

     "I do not think I could enlighten _you_ about China.Her game is
     and will be to wait events, and she will try and work so as to
     embroil us with France if she does go to war.For this there
     would be plenty of elements in the Treaty Ports.One may say,
     humanly speaking, China going to war with France must entail our
     following suit.It would be a bad thing in some ways for
     civilization, for the Chinese are naturally so bumptious that any
     success would make them more so, and if allied to us, and they
     had success, it would be a bad look-out afterwards.Li Hung Chang as Emperor, if such a thing came to pass,
     would be worse than the present Emperor, for he is sharp and
     clever, would unite China under a Chinese dynasty, and be much
     more troublesome to deal with.Altogether, I cannot think that
     the world would gain if China went to war with France.Also I
     think it would be eventually bad for China.China being a queer
     country, we might expect queer things, and I believe if she did
     go to war she would contract with Americans for the destruction
     of French fleet, and she would let loose a horde of adventurers
     with dynamite.This is essentially her style of action, and Li
     Hung Chang would take it up, but do not say I think so."In a further letter from Jaffa, dated 17th November 1883, he wrote
finally on this branch of the subject:--

     "I fear I can write nothing of any import, so I will not attempt
     it.To you I can remark that if I were the Government I would
     consider the part that should be taken when the inevitable fall
     of the Mantchou dynasty takes place, what steps they would take,
     and how they would act in the break-up, which, however, will only
     end in a fresh cohesion of China, for we, or no other Power,
     could never for long hold the country.At Penang, Singapore,
     etc., the Chinese will eventually oust us in another generation."There was one other question about China upon which Gordon felt very
strongly, viz., the opium question, and as he expressed views which I
combated, I feel bound to end this chapter by quoting what he wrote on
this much-discussed topic.On one point he agrees with myself and his
other opponents in admitting that the main object with the Chinese
authorities was increased revenue, not morality.They have since
attained their object not only by an increased import duty, but also
in the far more extensive cultivation of the native drug, to which the
Emperor, by Imperial Edict, has given his formal sanction:--

                                   "PORT LOUIS, _3rd February 1882_."About the opium article, I think your article--'History of the
     Opium Traffic,' _Times_, 4th January 1884--reads well.But the
     question is this.The Chinese _amour propre_ as a nation is hurt
     by the enforced entry of the drug.This irritation is connected
     with the remembrance of the wars which led to the Treaties about
     opium.Had eggs or apples been the cause of the wars, _i.e._ had
     the Chinese objected to the import of eggs, and we had insisted
     on their being imported, and carried out such importation in
     spite of the Chinese wish by force of war, it would be to my own
     mind the same thing as opium now is to Chinese.We do not give
     the Chinese credit for being so sensitive as they are.As Black
     Sea Treaty was to Russia so opium trade is to China."I take the root of the question to be as above.I do not mean to
     say that all that they urge is fictitious about morality; and I
     would go further than you, and say I think they would willingly
     give up their revenue from opium, indeed I am sure of it, if they
     could get rid of the forced importation by treaty, but their
     action in so doing would be simply one of satisfying their _amour
     propre_.The opium importation is a constant reminder of their
     defeats, and I feel sure China will never be good friends with us
     till it is abolished.It is for that reason I would give it up,
     for I think the only two alliances worth having are France and
     China."I have never, when I have written on it, said anything further
     than this, _i.e.the Chinese Government will not have it_, let us
     say it is a good drug or not.I also say that it is not fair to
     force anything on your neighbour, and, therefore, morally, it is
     wrong, even if it was eggs."Further, I say that through our thrusting these eggs on China,
     this opium, we caused the wars with China which shook the
     prestige of the Pekin Government, and the outcome of this war of
     1842 was the Taeping Rebellion, with its deaths of 13,000,000.The military prestige of the Mantchous was shaken by these
     defeats, the heavy contributions for war led to thousands of
     soldiers being disbanded, to a general impoverishment of the
     people, and this gave the rebel chief, Hung-tsew-tsiuen, his
     chance."A wants B to let him import eggs, B refuses, A coerces him;
     therefore I say it is wrong, and that it is useless discussing
     whether eggs are good or not."Can anyone doubt but that, if the Chinese Government had the
     power, they would stop importation to-morrow?If so, why keep a
     pressure like this on China whom we need as a friend, and with
     whom this importation is and ever will be the sole point about
     which we could be at variance?I know this is the point with Li
     Hung Chang."People may laugh at _amour propre_ of China.It is a positive
     fact, they are most-pigheaded on those points.China is the only
     nation in the world which is forced to take a thing she does not
     want.England is the only nation which forces another nation to
     do this, in order to benefit India by this act.Put like this it
     is outrageous."Note this, only certain classes of vessels are subject to the
     Foreign Customs Office at Canton.By putting all vessels under
     that Office the Chinese Government would make L2,000,000 a year
     more revenue.The Chinese Government will not do this however,
     because it would put power in hands of foreigners, so they lose
     it.Did you ever read the letters of the Ambassador before
     Marquis Tseng?His name, I think, was Coh or Kwoh.He wrote home
     to Pekin about Manchester, telling its wonders, but adding,
     'These people are wonderful, but the masses are miserable far
     beyond Chinese.They think only of money and not of the welfare
     of the people.'"Any foreign nation can raise the bile of Chinese by saying,
     'Look at the English, they forced you to take their opium.'"I should not be a bit surprised did I hear that Li Hung Chang
     smoked opium himself.I know a lot of the princes do, so they
     say.I have no doubt myself that what I have said is the true and
     only reason, or rather root reason.Put our nation in the same
     position of having been defeated and forced to accept some
     article which theory used to consider bad for the health, like
     tea used to be, we would rebel as soon as we could against it,
     though our people drink tea.The opium trade is a standing,
     ever-present memento of defeat and heavy payments; and the
     Chinese cleverly take advantage of the fact that it is a
     deleterious drug."The opium wars were not about opium--opium was only a _cheval de
     bataille_.They were against the introduction of foreigners, a
     political question, and so the question of opium import is now.As for the loss to India by giving it up, it is quite another
     affair.On one hand you have gain, an embittered feeling and an
     injustice; on the other you have loss, friendly nations and
     justice.Cut down pay of all officers in India to Colonial
     allowances _above_ rank of captains.Do not give them Indian
     allowances, and you will cover nearly the loss, I expect.Why
     should officers in India have more than officers in Hongkong?"In a subsequent letter, dated from the Cape, 20th July 1882, General
Gordon replied to some objections I had raised as follows:--

     "As for the opium, to which you say the same objection applies as
     to tea, etc., it is not so, for opium has for ages been a tabooed
     article among Chinese respectable people.I own reluctance to
     foreign intercourse applies to what I said, but the Chinese know
     that the intercourse with foreigners cannot be stopped, and it,
     as well as the forced introduction of opium, are signs of defeat;
     yet one, that of intercourse, cannot be stopped or wiped away
     while the opium question can be.I am writing in a hurry, so am
     not very clear."What I mean is that no one country forces another country to
     take a drug like opium, and therefore the Chinese feel the
     forced introduction of opium as an intrusion and injustice;
     thence their feelings in the matter.This, I feel sure, is the
     case."What could our Government do _in re_ opium?Well, I should say,
     let the clause of treaty lapse about it, and let the smuggling be
     renewed."Pekin would, or rather could, never succeed in cutting off
     foreign intercourse.The Chinese are too much mixed up (and are
     increasingly so every year) with foreigners for Pekin even to try
     it.Also I do not think China would wish to stop its importation
     altogether.All they ask is an increased duty on it."CHAPTER X.

THE MAURITIUS, THE CAPE, AND THE CONGO.There was a moment of hesitation in Gordon's mind as to whether he
would come home or not.His first project on laying down the Indian
Secretaryship had been to go to Zanzibar and attack the slave trade
from that side.Before his plans were matured the China offer came,
and turned his thoughts in a different channel.On his arrival at
Aden, on the way back, he found that the late Sir William Mackinnon, a
truly great English patriot of the type of the merchant adventurers of
the Elizabethan age, had sent instructions that the ships of the
British India Steam Packet Company were at his disposal to convey him
whereever he liked, and for a moment the thought occurred to him to
turn aside to Zanzibar.But a little reflection led him to think that,
as he had been accused of insubordination, it would be better for him
to return home and report himself at headquarters.When he arrived in
London at the end of October 1880, he found that his letters, written
chiefly to his sister during his long sojourn in the Soudan, were on
the eve of publication by Dr Birkbeck Hill.That exceedingly
interesting volume placed at the disposal of the public the evidence
as to his great work in Africa, which might otherwise have been buried
in oblivion.It was written under considerable difficulties, for
Gordon would not see Dr Hill, and made a stringent proviso that he was
not to be praised, and that nothing unkind was to be said about
anyone.He did, however, stipulate for a special tribute of praise to
be given to his Arab secretary, Berzati Bey, "my only companion for
these years--my adviser and my counsellor."Berzati was among those
who perished with the ill-fated expedition of Hicks Pasha at the end
of 1883.To the publication of this work must be attributed the
establishment of Gordon's reputation as the authority on the Soudan,
and the prophetic character of many of his statements became clear
when events confirmed them.After a stay at Southampton and in London of a few weeks, Gordon was
at last induced to give himself a short holiday, and, strangely
enough, he selected Ireland as his recreation ground.I have been told
that Gordon had a strain of Irish blood in him, but I have failed to
discover it genealogically, nor was there any trace of its influence
on his character.He was not fortunate in the season of the year he
selected, nor in the particular part of the country he chose for his
visit.There is scenery in the south-west division of Ireland, quite
apart from the admitted beauty of the Killarney district, that will
vie with better known and more highly lauded places in Scotland and
Switzerland, but no one would recommend a stranger to visit that
quarter of Ireland at the end of November, and the absence of
cultivation, seen under the depressing conditions of Nature, would
strike a visitor with all the effect of absolute sterility.Gordon was
so impressed, and it seemed to him that the Irish peasants of a whole
province were existing in a state of wretchedness exceeding anything
he had seen in either China or the Soudan.If he had seen the same
places six months earlier, he would have formed a less extreme view of
their situation.It was just the condition of things that appealed to
his sympathy, and with characteristic promptitude he put his views on
paper, making one definite offer on his own part, and sent them to a
friend, the present General James Donnelly, a distinguished engineer
officer and old comrade, and moreover a member of a well-known Irish
family.Considering the contents of the letter, and the form in which
Gordon threw out his suggestions, it is not very surprising that
General Donnelly sent it to _The Times_, in which it was published on
3rd December 1880; but Gordon himself was annoyed at this step being
taken, because he realised that he had written somewhat hastily on a
subject with which he could scarcely be deemed thoroughly acquainted.The following is its text:--

     "You are aware how interested I am in the welfare of this
     country, and, having known you for twenty-six years, I am sure I
     may say the same of you."I have lately been over to the south-west of Ireland in the hope
     of discovering how some settlement could be made of the Irish
     question, which, like a fretting cancer, eats away our vitals as
     a nation."I have come to the conclusion that--

     "1.A gulf of antipathy exists between the landlords and tenants
     of the north-west, west, and south-west of Ireland.It is a gulf
     which is not caused alone by the question of rent; there is a
     complete lack of sympathy between these two classes.It is
     useless to inquire how such a state of things has come to pass.I
     call your attention to the pamphlets, letters, and speeches of
     the landlord class, as a proof of how little sympathy or kindness
     there exists among them for the tenantry, and I am sure that the
     tenantry feel in the same way towards the landlords.No half-measured Acts which left the landlords with any say
     to the tenantry of these portions of Ireland will be of any use.They would be rendered--as past Land Acts in Ireland have
     been--quite abortive, for the landlords will insert clauses to do
     away with their force.Any half-measures will only place the
     Government face to face with the people of Ireland as the
     champions of the landlord interest.The Government would be bound
     to enforce their decision, and with a result which none can
     foresee, but which certainly would be disastrous to the common
     weal.My idea is that, seeing--through this cause or that, it is
     immaterial to examine--a deadlock has occurred between the
     present landlords and tenants, the Government should purchase up
     the rights of the landlords over the whole or the greater part of
     Longford, Westmeath, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Leitrim,
     Sligo, Mayo, Cavan, and Donegal.The yearly rental of these
     districts is some four millions; if the Government give the
     landlords twenty years' purchase, it would cost eighty millions,
     which at three and a half per cent.would give a yearly interest
     of L2,800,000, of which L2,500,000 could be recovered; the lands
     would be Crown lands; they would be administered by a Land
     Commission, who would be supplemented by an Emigration
     Commission, which might for a short time need L100,000.This
     would not injure the landlords, and, so far as it is an
     interference with proprietary rights, it is as just as is the law
     which forces Lord A. to allow a railway through his park for the
     public benefit.I would restrain the landlords from any power or
     control in these Crown land districts.Poor-law, roads, schools,
     etc., should be under the Land Commission.For the rest of Ireland, I would pass an Act allowing free
     sale of leases, fair rents, and a Government valuation."In conclusion, I must say, from all accounts and my own
     observation, that the state of our fellow-countrymen in the parts
     I have named is worse than that of any people in the world, let
     alone Europe.I believe that these people are made as we are,
     that they are patient beyond belief, loyal, but, at the same
     time, broken-spirited and desperate, living on the verge of
     starvation in places in which we would not keep our cattle."The Bulgarians, Anatolians, Chinese, and Indians are better off
     than many of them are.The priests alone have any sympathy with
     their sufferings, and naturally alone have a hold over them.In
     these days, in common justice, if we endow a Protestant
     University, why should we not endow a Catholic University in a
     Catholic country?Is it not as difficult to get a L5 note from a
     Protestant as from a Catholic or Jew?Read the letters of ----
     and of ----, and tell me if you see in them any particle of kind
     feeling towards the tenantry; and if you have any doubts about
     this, investigate the manner in which the Relief Fund was
     administered, and in which the sums of money for improvements of
     estates by landlords were expended."In 1833 England gave freedom to the West Indian slaves at a cost
     of twenty millions--worth now thirty millions.This money left
     the country.By an expenditure of
     eighty millions she may free her own people.She would have the
     hold over the land, and she would cure a cancer.I am not well
     off, but I would offer ---- or his agent L1000, if either of them
     would live one week in one of these poor devil's places, and feed
     as these people do.Our comic prints do an infinity of harm by
     their caricatures--firstly, the caricatures are not true, for the
     crime in Ireland is not greater than that in England; and,
     secondly, they exasperate the people on both sides of the
     Channel, and they do no good."It is ill to laugh and scoff at a question which affects our
     existence."This heroic mode of dealing with an old and very complicated
difficulty scarcely came within the range of practical achievement.The Irish question is not to be solved by any such simple
cut-and-dried procedure.It will take time, sympathy, and good-will.When the English people have eradicated their opinion that the Irish
are an inferior race, and when the Irish realise that the old
prejudice has vanished, the root-difficulty will be removed.At least
Gordon deserves the credit of having seen that much from his brief
observation on the spot, and his plea for them as "patient beyond
belief and loyal," may eventually carry conviction to the hearts of
the more powerful and prosperous kingdom.The Irish question was not the only one on which he recorded a written
opinion.The question of retaining Candahar was very much discussed
during the winter of 1880-81, and as the Liberal Government was very
much put to it to get high military opinion to support their proposal
of abandonment, they were very glad when Gordon wrote to _The Times_
expressing a strong opinion on their side.I think the writing of that
letter was mainly due to a sense of obligation to Lord Ripon, although
the argument used as to the necessity of Candahar being held by any
_single_ ruler of Afghanistan was, and is always, unanswerable.But
the question at that time was this: Could any such single ruler be
found, and was Abdurrahman, recognised in the August of 1880 as Ameer
of Cabul, the man?On 27th July 1880, less than eight weeks after Gordon's resignation of
his Indian appointment, occurred the disastrous battle of Maiwand,
when Yakoob's younger brother, Ayoob, gained a decisive victory over a
British force.That disaster was retrieved six weeks later by Lord
Roberts, but Ayoob remained in possession of Herat and the whole of
the country west of the Helmund.It was well known that the rivalry
between him and his cousin Abdurrahman did not admit of being patched
up, and that it could only be settled by the sword.At the moment
there was more reason to believe in the military talent of Ayoob than
of the present Ameer, and it was certain that the instant we left
Candahar the two opponents would engage in a struggle for its
possession.The policy of precipitate evacuation left everything to
the chapter of accidents, and if Ayoob had proved the victor, or even
able to hold his ground, the situation in Afghanistan would have been
eminently favourable for that foreign intervention which only the
extraordinary skill and still more extraordinary success of the Ameer
Abdurrahman has averted.In giving the actual text of Gordon's letter,
it is only right, while frankly admitting that the course pursued has
proved most successful and beneficial, to record that it might well
have been otherwise, and that as a mere matter of argument the
probability was quite the other way.Neither Gordon nor any other
supporter of the evacuation policy ventured to predict that
Abdurrahman, who was then not a young man, and whose early career had
been one of failure, was going to prove himself the ablest
administrator and most astute statesman in Afghan history."Those who advocate the retention of Candahar do so generally on
     the ground that its retention would render more difficult the
     advance of Russia on, and would prevent her fomenting rebellion
     in, India, and that our prestige in India would suffer by its
     evacuation."I think that this retention would throw Afghanistan, in the hope
     of regaining Candahar, into alliance with Russia, and that
     thereby Russia would be given a temptation to offer which she
     otherwise would not have.Supposing that temptation did not
     exist, what other inducement could Russia offer for this
     alliance?If, then, Russia did advance, she
     would bring her auxiliary tribes, who, with their natural
     predatory habits, would soon come to loggerheads with their
     natural enemies, the Afghans, and that the sooner when these
     latter were aided by us.Would the Afghans in such a case be
     likely to be tempted by the small share they would get of the
     plunder of India to give up their secure, independent position
     and our alliance for that plunder, and to put their country at
     the mercy of Russia, whom they hate as cordially as they do us?If we evacuate Candahar, Afghanistan can only have this small
     inducement of the plunder of India for Russia to offer her.Some
     say that the people of Candahar desire our rule.I cannot think
     that any people like being governed by aliens in race or
     religion.They prefer their own bad native governments to a
     stiff, civilized government, in spite of the increased worldly
     prosperity the latter may give."We may be sure that at Candahar the spirit which induced
     children to kill, or to attempt to kill our soldiers in 1879,
     etc., still exists, though it may be cowed.We have trouble
     enough with the fanatics of India; why should we go out of our
     way to add to their numbers?"From a military point of view, by the retention we should
     increase the line we have to defend by twice the distance of
     Candahar to the present frontier, and place an objective point to
     be attacked.Naturally we should make good roads to Candahar,
     which on the loss of a battle there--and such things must be
     always calculated as within possibility--would aid the advance of
     the enemy to the Indus.The _debouche_ of the defiles, with good
     lateral communications between them, is the proper line of
     defence for India, not the entry into those defiles, which cannot
     have secure lateral communications.If the entries of the defiles
     are held, good roads are made through them; and these aid the
     enemy, if you lose the entries or have them turned.This does not
     prevent the passage of the defiles being disputed."The retention of Candahar would tend to foment rebellion in
     India, and not prevent it; for thereby we should obtain an
     additional number of fanatical malcontents, who as British
     subjects would have the greatest facility of passing to and fro
     in India, which they would not have if we did not hold it."That our prestige would suffer in India by the evacuation I
     doubt; it certainly would suffer if we kept it and forsook our
     word--_i.e._ that we made war against Shere Ali, and not against
     his people.The native peoples of India would willingly part with
     any amount of prestige if they obtained less taxation."India should be able, by a proper defence of her present
     frontier and by the proper government of her peoples, to look
     after herself.If the latter is wanting, no advance of frontier
     will aid her."I am not anxious about Russia; but, were I so, I would care much
     more to see precautions taken for the defence of our Eastern
     colonies, now that Russia has moved her Black Sea naval
     establishment to the China Sea, than to push forward an
     outstretched arm to Candahar.The interests of the Empire claim
     as much attention as India, and one cannot help seeing that they
     are much more imperilled by this last move of Russia than by
     anything she can do in Central Asia."Politically, militarily, and morally, Candahar ought not to be
     retained.It would oblige us to keep up an interference with the
     internal affairs of Afghanistan, would increase the expenditure
     of impoverished India, and expose us chronically to the reception
     of those painfully sensational telegrams of which we have had a
     surfeit of late."During these few months Gordon wrote on several other subjects--the
Abyssinian question, in connection with which he curiously enough
styled "the Abyssinians the best of mountaineers," a fact not
appreciated until their success over the Italians many years later,
the registration of slaves in Egypt, and the best way of carrying on
irregular warfare in difficult country and against brave and active
races.His remarks on the last subject were called forth by our
experiences in the field against the Zulus in the first place, and the
Boers in the second, and quite exceptional force was given to them by
the occurrence of the defeat at Majuba Hill one day after they
appeared in the _Army and Navy Gazette_.For this reason I quote the
article in its entirety:--

     "The individual man of any country in which active outdoor life,
     abstinence, hunting of wild game, and exposure to all weathers
     are the habits of life, is more than a match for the private
     soldier of a regular army, who is taken from the plough or from
     cities, and this is the case doubly as much when the field of
     operations is a difficult country, and when the former is, and
     the latter is not, acclimatised.On the one hand, the former is
     accustomed to the climate, knows the country, and is trained to
     long marches and difficulties of all sorts inseparable from his
     daily life; the latter is unacclimatised, knows nothing of the
     country, and, accustomed to have his every want supplied, is at a
     loss when any extraordinary hardships or difficulties are
     encountered; he has only his skill in his arms and discipline in
     his favour, and sometimes that skill may be also possessed by his
     foe.The native of the country has to contend with a difficulty
     in maintaining a long contest, owing to want of means and want of
     discipline, being unaccustomed to any yoke interfering with
     individual freedom.The resources of a regular army, in
     comparison to those of the natives of the country, are infinite,
     but it is accustomed to discipline.In a difficult country, when
     the numbers are equal, and when the natives are of the
     description above stated, the regular forces are certainly at a
     very great disadvantage, until, by bitter experience in the
     field, they are taught to fight in the same irregular way as
     their foes, and this lesson may be learnt at a great cost.I
     therefore think that when regular forces enter into a campaign
     under these conditions, the former ought to avoid any unnecessary
     haste, for time does not press with them, while every day
     increases the burden on a country without resources and
     unaccustomed to discipline, and as the forces of the country,
     unprovided with artillery, never ought to be able to attack
     fortified posts, any advance should be made by the establishment
     of such posts.All engagements in the field ought, if possible,
     to be avoided, except by corps raised from people who in their
     habits resemble those in arms, or else by irregular corps raised
     for the purpose, apart from the routine and red-tape inseparable
     from regular armies.The regular forces will act as the back-bone
     of the expedition, but the rock and cover fighting will be done
     better by levies of such specially raised irregulars.For war
     with native countries, I think that, except for the defence of
     posts, artillery is a great incumbrance, far beyond its value.It
     is a continual source of anxiety.Its transport regulates the
     speed of the march, and it forms a target for the enemy, while
     its effects on the scattered enemy is almost _nil_.An advance of
     regular troops, as at present organised, is just the sort of
     march that suits an active native foe.The regulars' column must
     be heaped together, covering its transport and artillery.The
     enemy knows the probable point of its destination on a particular
     day, and then, knowing that the regulars cannot halt definitely
     where it may be chosen to attack, it hovers round the column like
     wasps.The regulars cannot, from not being accustomed to the
     work, go clambering over rocks, or beating covers after their
     foes.Therefore I conclude that in these wars[1] regular troops
     should only act as a reserve; that the real fighting should be
     done either by native allies or by special irregular corps,
     commanded by special men, who would be untrammelled by
     regulations; that, except for the defence of posts, artillery
     should be abandoned.It may seem egotistical, but I may state
     that I should never have succeeded against native foes had I not
     had flanks, and front, and rear covered by irregular forces.Whenever either the flanks, or rear, or front auxiliaries were
     barred in their advance, we turned the regular forces on that
     point, and thus strengthening the hindered auxiliaries, drove
     back the enemy.We owed defeats, when they occurred, to the
     absence of these auxiliaries, and on two occasions to having
     cannon with the troops, which lost us 1600 men.The Abyssinians,
     who are the best of mountaineers, though they have them, utterly
     despise cannon, as they hinder their movements.I could give
     instance after instance where, in native wars, regular troops
     could not hold their own against an active guerilla, and where,
     in some cases, the disasters of the regulars were brought about
     by being hampered by cannon.No one can deny artillery may be
     most efficient in the contention of two regular armies, but it is
     quite the reverse in guerilla warfare.The inordinate haste which
     exists to finish off these wars throws away many valuable aids
     which would inevitably accrue to the regular army if time was
     taken to do the work, and far greater expense is caused by this
     hurry than otherwise would be necessary.All is done on the
     '_Veni, vidi, vici_' principle.It may be very fine, but it is
     bloody and expensive, and not scientific.I am sure it will occur
     to many, the times we have advanced, without proper breaches,
     bridges, etc., and with what loss, assaulted.It would seem that
     military science should be entirely thrown away when combating
     native tribes.I think I am correct in saying that the Romans
     always fought with large auxiliary forces of the invaded country
     or its neighbours, and I know it was the rule of the Russians in
     Circassia."[1] In allusion more particularly to the Cape and China.Perhaps Gordon was influenced by the catastrophes in South Africa when
he sent the following telegram at his own expense to the Cape
authorities on 7th April 1881: "Gordon offers his services for two
years at L700 per annum to assist in terminating war and administering
Basutoland."To this telegram he was never accorded even the courtesy
of a negative reply.It will be remembered that twelve months earlier
the Cape Government had offered him the command of the forces, and
that his reply had been to refuse.The incident is of some interest as
showing that his attention had been directed to the Basuto question,
and also that he was again anxious for active employment.His wish for
the latter was to be realised in an unexpected manner.He was staying in London when, on visiting the War Office, he casually
met the late Colonel Sir Howard Elphinstone, an officer of his own
corps, who began by complaining of his hard luck in its just having
fallen to his turn to fill the post of Engineer officer in command at
the Mauritius, and such was the distastefulness of the prospect of
service in such a remote and unattractive spot, that Sir Howard went
on to say that he thought he would sooner retire from the service.In
his impulsive manner Gordon at once exclaimed: "Oh, don't worry
yourself, I will go for you; Mauritius is as good for me as anywhere
else."The exact manner in which this exchange was brought about has
been variously described, but this is the literal version given me by
General Gordon himself, and there is no doubt that, as far as he could
regret anything that had happened, he bitterly regretted the accident
that caused him to become acquainted with the Mauritius.In a letter
to myself on the subject from Port Louis he said: "It was not over
cheerful to go out to this place, nor is it so to find a deadly sleep
over all my military friends here."In making the arrangements which
were necessary to effect the official substitution of himself for
Colonel Elphinstone, Gordon insisted on only two points: first, that
Elphinstone should himself arrange the exchange; and secondly that no
payment was to be made to him as was usual--in this case about
L800--on an exchange being effected.Sir Howard Elphinstone was thus
saved by Gordon's peculiarities a disagreeable experience and a
considerable sum of money.Some years after Gordon's death Sir Howard
met with a tragic fate, being washed overboard while taking a trip
during illness to Madeira.Like everything else he undertook, Gordon determined to make his
Mauritius appointment a reality, and although he was only in the
island twelve months, and during that period took a trip to the
interesting group of the Seychelles, he managed to compress an immense
amount of work into that short space, and to leave on record some
valuable reports on matters of high importance.He found at Mauritius
the same dislike for posts that were outside the ken of headquarters,
and the same indifference to the dry details of professional work that
drove officers of high ability and attainments to think of resigning
the service sooner than fill them, and, when they did take them, to
pass their period of exile away from the charms of Pall Mall in a
state of inaction that verged on suspended animation.In a passage
already quoted, he refers to the deadly sleep of his military friends,
and then he goes on to say in a sentence, which cannot be too much
taken to heart by those who have to support this mighty empire, with
enemies on every hand--"We are in a perfect Fools' Paradise about our
power.We have plenty of power if we would pay attention to our work,
but the fault is, to my mind, the military power of the country is
eaten up by selfishness and idleness, and we are trading on the
reputation of our forefathers.When one sees by the newspapers the
Emperor of Germany sitting, old as he is, for two long hours
inspecting his troops, and officers here grudging two hours a week for
their duties, one has reason to fear the future."During his stay at Mauritius he wrote three papers of first-rate
importance.One of them on Egyptian affairs after the deposition of
Ismail may be left for the next chapter, and the two others, one on
coaling stations in the Indian Ocean, and the second on the
comparative merits of the Cape and Mediterranean routes come within
the scope of this chapter, and are, moreover, deserving of special
consideration.With regard to the former of these two important
subjects, Gordon wrote as follows, but I cannot discover that anything
has been done to give practical effect to his recommendations:--

     "I spoke to you concerning Borneo and the necessity for coaling
     stations in the Eastern seas.Taking Mauritius with its large
     French population, the Cape with its conflicting elements, and
     Hongkong, Singapore, and Penang with their vast Chinese
     populations, who may be with or against us, but who are at any
     time a nuisance, I would select such places where no temptation
     would induce colonists to come, and I would use them as maritime
     fortresses.For instance, the only good coaling place between
     Suez and Adelaide would be in the Chagos group, which contain a
     beautiful harbour at San Diego.My object is to secure this for
     the strengthening of our maritime power.These islands are of
     great strategical importance _vis a vis_ with India, Suez, and
     Singapore.Remember Aden has no harbour to speak of, and has the
     need of a garrison, while Chagos could be kept by a company of
     soldiers.It is wonderful our people do not take the views of our
     forefathers.They took up their positions at all the salient
     points of the routes.We can certainly hold these places, but
     from the colonial feelings they have almost ceased to be our own.By establishing these coaling stations no diplomatic
     complications could arise, while by their means we could unite
     all our colonies with us, for we could give them effective
     support.The spirit of no colony would bear up for long against
     the cutting off of its trade, which would happen if we kept
     watching the Mediterranean and neglected the great ocean routes.The cost would not be more than these places cost now, if the
     principle of heavily-armed, light-draught, swift gunboats with
     suitable arsenals, properly (not over) defended, were followed."Chagos as well as Seychelles forms part of the administrative group of
the Mauritius.The former with, as Gordon states, an admirable port in
San Diego, lies in the direct route to Australia from the Red Sea, and
the latter contains an equally good harbour in Port Victoria Mahe.The
Seychelles are remarkably healthy islands--thirty in number--and
Gordon recommended them as a good place for "a man with a little money
to settle in."He also advanced the speculative and somewhat
imaginative theory that in them was to be found the true site of the
Garden of Eden.The views Gordon expressed in 1881 as to the diminished importance of
the Mediterranean as an English interest, and the relative superiority
of the Cape over the Canal route, on the ground of its security, were
less commonly held then than they have since become.Whether they are
sound is not to be taken on the trust of even the greatest of
reputations; and in so complicated and many-sided a problem it will be
well to consider all contingencies, and to remember that there is no
reason why England should not be able in war-time to control them
both, until at least the remote epoch when Palestine shall be a
Russian possession."I think Malta has very much lost its importance.The
     Mediterranean now differs much from what it was in 1815.Other
     nations besides France possess in it great dockyards and
     arsenals, and its shores are backed by united peoples.Any war
     with Great Britain in the Mediterranean with any one Power would
     inevitably lead to complications with neutral nations.Steam has
     changed the state of affairs, and has brought the Mediterranean
     close to every nation of Europe.War in the Mediterranean is _war
     in a basin_, the borders of which are in the hands of other
     nations, all pretty powerful and interested in trade, and all
     likely to be affected by any turmoil in that basin, and to be
     against the makers of such turmoil.In fact, the Mediterranean
     trade is so diverted by the railroads of Europe, that it is but
     of small importance.The trade which is of value is the trade
     east of Suez, which, passing through the Canal, depends upon its
     being kept open.If the entrance to the Mediterranean were
     blocked at Gibraltar by a heavy fleet, I cannot see any advantage
     to be gained against us by the fleets blocked up in it--at any
     rate I would say, let our _first care_ be for the Cape route, and
     secondly for the Mediterranean and Canal.The former route
     entails no complications, the latter endless ones, coupled with a
     precarious tenure.Look at the Mediterranean, and see how small
     is that sea on which we are apparently devoting the greater part
     of our attention.The
     Resident, according to existing orders, reports to Bombay, and
     Bombay to _that_ Simla Council, which knows and cares nothing
     for the question.A special regiment should be raised for its
     protection."While stationed in the Mauritius, Gordon attained the rank of
Major-General in the army, and another colonel of Engineers was sent
out to take his place.During the last three months of his residence
he filled, in addition to his own special post, that of the command of
all the troops on the station, and at one time it seemed as if he
might have been confirmed in the appointment.But this was not done,
owing, as he suggested, to the "determination not to appoint officers
of the Royal Artillery or Engineers to any command;" but a more
probable reason was that Gordon had been inquiring about and had
discovered that the colonists were not only a little discontented, but
had some ground for their discontent.By this time Gordon's
uncompromising sense of justice was beginning to be known in high
official quarters, and the then responsible Government had far too
many cares on its shoulders that could not be shirked to invite others
from so remote and unimportant a possession as the Mauritius.Even before any official decision could have been arrived at in this
matter, fate had provided him with another destination.Two passages have already been cited, showing the overtures first made
by the Cape Government, and then by Gordon himself, for his employment
in South Africa.On 23rd
February 1882, when an announcement was made by myself that Gordon
would vacate his command in a few weeks' time, the Cape Government
again expressed its desire to obtain the use of his services, and
moreover recollected the telegram to which no reply had been sent.Sir
Hercules Robinson, then Governor of the Cape, sent the following
telegram to the Colonial Secretary, the Earl of Kimberley:--

     "Ministers request me to inquire whether H.M.'s Government would
     permit them to obtain the services of Colonel Charles Gordon.Ministers desire to invite Colonel Gordon to come to this Colony
     for the purpose of consultation as to the best measures to be
     adopted with reference to Basutoland, in the event of Parliament
     sanctioning their proposals as to that territory, and to engage
     his services, should he be willing to renew the offer made to
     their predecessors in April 1881, to assist in terminating the
     war and administering Basutoland."Lord Kimberley then sent instructions by telegraph to Durban, and
thence by steamer, sanctioning Gordon's employment and his immediate
departure from the Mauritius.The increasing urgency of the Basuto
question induced the Cape Government to send a message by telegraph to
Aden, and thence by steamer direct to Gordon.In this message they
stated that "the services of some one of proved ability, firmness, and
energy," were required; that they did not expect Gordon to be bound by
the salary named in his own telegram, and that they begged him to
visit the Colony "at once"--repeating the phrase twice.All these
messages reached Gordon's hands on 2nd April.Two days later he
started in the sailing vessel _Scotia_, no other ship being
obtainable.The Cape authorities had therefore no ground to complain of the
dilatoriness of the man to whom they appealed in their difficulty,
although their telegram was despatched 3rd of March, and Gordon did
not reach Cape Town before the 3rd of May.It will be quite understood
that Gordon had offered in the first place, and been specially invited
in the second place, to proceed to the Cape, for the purpose of
dealing with the difficulty in Basutoland.He was to find that, just
as his mission to China had been complicated by extraneous
circumstances, so was his visit to the Cape to be rendered more
difficult by Party rivalries, and by work being thrust upon him which
he had several times refused to accept, and for the efficient
discharge of which, in his own way, he knew he would never obtain the
requisite authority.Before entering upon this matter a few words may be given to the
financial agreement between himself and the Cape Government.The first
office in 1880 had carried with it a salary of L1500; in 1881 Gordon
had offered to go for L700; in 1882 the salary was to be a matter of
arrangement, and on arrival at Cape Town he was offered L1200 a year.He refused to accept more than L800 a year; but as he required and
insisted on having a secretary, the other L400 was assigned for that
purpose.In naming such a small and inadequate salary Gordon was under
the mistaken belief that his imperial pay of L500 a year would
continue, but, unfortunately for him, a new regulation, 25th June
1881, had come into force while he was buried away in the Mauritius,
and he was disqualified from the receipt of the income he had earned.Gordon was very indignant, more especially because it was clear that
he was doing public service at the Cape, while, as he said with some
bitterness, if he had started an hotel or become director of a
company, his pay would have gone on all the same.The only suggestion
the War Office made was that he should ask the Cape Government to
compensate him, but this he indignantly refused.In the result all his
savings during the Mauritius command were swallowed up, and I believe
I understate the amount when I say that his Cape experience cost him
out of his own pocket from first to last five hundred pounds.That sum
was a very considerable one to a man who never inherited any money,
and who went through life scorning all opportunities of making it.But on this occasion he vindicated a principle, and showed that
"money was not his object."As Gordon went to the Cape specially for the purpose of treating the
Basutoland question, it may be well to describe briefly what that
question was.Basutoland is a mountainous country, difficult of
access, but in resources self-sufficing, on the eastern side of the
Orange Free State, and separated from Natal and Kaffraria, or the
Transkei division of Cape Colony, by the sufficiently formidable
Drakensberg range.Its population consisted of 150,000 stalwart and
freedom-loving Highlanders, ruled by four chiefs--Letsea, Masupha,
Molappo, and Lerothodi, with only the three first of whom had Gordon
in any way to deal.Notwithstanding their numbers, courage, and the
natural strength of their country, they owed their safety from
absorption by the Boers to British protection, especially in 1868, and
they were taken over by us as British subjects without any formality
three years later.They do not seem to have objected so long as the
tie was indefinite, but when in 1880 it was attempted to enforce the
regulations of the Peace Preservation Act by disarming these clans,
then the Basutos began a pronounced and systematic opposition.Letsea
and Lerothodi kept up the pretence of friendliness, but Masupha
fortified his chief residence at Thaba Bosigo, and openly prepared for
war.That war had gone on for two years without result, and the total
cost of the Basuto question had been four millions sterling when
Gordon was summoned to the scene.Having given this general
description of the question, it will be well to state the details of
the matters in dispute, as set forth by Gordon after he had examined
all the papers and heard the evidence of the most competent and
well-informed witnesses.His memorandum, dated 26th May 1882, read as follows:--

     "In 1843 the Basuto chiefs entered into a treaty with Her
     Majesty's Government, by which the limits of Basutoland were
     recognised roughly in 1845.The Basuto chiefs agreed by
     convention with Her Majesty's Government to a concession of land
     on terminable leases, on the condition that Her Majesty's
     Government should protect them from Her Majesty's subjects."In 1848 the Basuto chiefs agreed to accept the Sovereignty of
     Her Majesty the Queen, on the understanding that Her Majesty's
     Government would restrain Her Majesty's subjects in the
     territories they possessed."Between 1848 and 1852, notwithstanding the above treaties, a
     large portion of Basutoland was annexed by the proclamation of
     Her Majesty's Government, and this annexation was accompanied by
     hostilities, which were afterwards decided by Sir George Cathcart
     as being undertaken in support of unjustifiable aggression."In 1853, notwithstanding the treaties, Basutoland was abandoned,
     leaving its chiefs to settle as they could with the Europeans of
     the Free State who were settled in Basutoland and were mixed up
     with the Basuto people."In 1857, the Basutos asked Her Majesty's Government to arbitrate
     and settle their quarrels."In 1858 the Free State interfered to protect their settlers, and
     a war ensued, and the Free State was reduced to great
     extremities, and asked Her Majesty's Government to mediate.This
     was agreed to, and a frontier line was fixed by Her Majesty's
     Government."In 1865 another war broke out between the Free State and the
     Basutos, at the close of which the Basutos lost territory, and
     were accepted as British subjects by Her Majesty's Government for
     the second time, being placed under the direct government of Her
     Majesty's High Commissioner."In 1871 Basutoland was annexed to the _Crown_ Colony of the Cape
     of Good Hope, without the Basutos having been consulted."In 1872 the _Crown_ Colony became a colony with a responsible
     Government, and the Basutos were placed virtually under another
     power.The Basutos asked for representation in the Colonial
     Parliament, which was refused, and to my mind here was the
     mistake committed which led to these troubles."Then came constant disputes, the Disarmament Act, the Basuto
     War, and present state of affairs."From this chronology there are four points that stand out in
     relief:--

     "1.That the Basuto people, who date back generations, made
     treaties with the British Government, which treaties are equally
     binding, whether between two powerful states, or between a
     powerful state and a weak one.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos lost land.That, in defiance of the treaties, the Basutos, without being
     consulted or having their rights safeguarded, were handed over to
     another power--the Colonial Government.That that other power proceeded to enact their disarmament, a
     process which could only be carried out with a servile race, like
     the Hindoos of the plains of India, and which any one of
     understanding must see would be resisted to the utmost by any
     people worth the name; the more so in the case of the Basutos,
     who realised the constant contraction of their frontiers in
     defiance of the treaties made with the British Government, and
     who could not possibly avoid the conclusion that this disarmament
     was only a prelude to their extinction."The necessary and inevitable result of the four deductions was
     that the Basutos resisted, and remain passively resisting to this
     day."The fault lay in the British Government not having consulted the
     Basutos, their co-treaty power, when they handed them over to the
     Colonial Government.They should have called together a national
     assembly of the Basuto people, in which the terms of the transfer
     could have been quietly arranged, and this I consider is the root
     of all the troubles, and expenses, and miseries which have sprung
     up; and therefore, as it is always best to go to the root of any
     malady, I think it would be as well to let bygones be bygones,
     and to commence afresh by calling together by proclamation a
     Pitso of the whole tribe, in order to discuss the best means of
     sooner securing the settlement of the country.I think that some
     such proclamation should be issued.By this Pitso we would know
     the exact position of affairs, and the real point in which the
     Basutos are injured or considered themselves to be injured."To those who wish for the total abandonment of Basutoland, this
     course must be palatable; to those who wish the Basutos well, and
     desire not to see them exterminated, it must also be palatable;
     and to those who hate the name of Basutoland it must be
     palatable, for it offers a solution which will prevent them ever
     hearing the name again."This Pitso ought to be called at once.All Colonial officials
     ought to be absent, for what the colony wants is to know what is
     the matter; and the colony wishes to know it from the Basuto
     people, irrespective of the political parties of the Government."Such a course would certainly recommend itself to the British
     Government, and to its masters--the British people."Provided the demands of the Basutos--who will, for their own
     sakes, never be for a severing of their connection with the
     colony, in order to be eventually devoured by the Orange Free
     State--are such as will secure the repayment to the colony of all
     expenses incurred by the Colonial Government in the maintenance
     of this connection, and I consider that the Colonial Government
     should accept them."With respect to the Loyals, there are some 800 families, the
     cost of keeping whom is on an average one shilling per diem each
     family, that is L40 per diem, or L1200 per month, and they have
     been rationed during six months at cost of L7200.Their claims
     may therefore be said to be some L80,000.Now, if these 800
     families (some say half) have claims amounting to L30 each
     individually (say 400 families at L30), L12,000 paid at once
     would rid the colony of the cost of subsistence of these
     families, viz.L600 a month (the retention of them would only add
     to the colonial expenditure, and tend to pauperise them)."I believe that L30,000 paid at once to the Loyals would reduce
     their numbers to one-fourth what they are now.It is proposed to
     send up a Commission to examine into their claims; the Commission
     will not report under two months, and there will be the delay of
     administration at Cape Town, during all which time L1200 a month
     are being uselessly expended by the colony, detrimentally to the
     Loyals.Therefore I recommend (1) that the sum of L30,000 should
     be at once applied to satisfy the minor claims of the Loyals; (2)
     that this should be done at once, at same time as the meeting of
     the National Pitso."The effect of this measure in connection with the meeting of the
     National Pitso would be very great, for it would be a positive
     proof of the good disposition of the Colonial Government.The
     greater claims could, if necessary, wait for the Parliamentary
     Commission, but I would deprecate even this delay, and though for
     the distribution of the L30,000 I would select those on whom the
     responsibility of such distribution could be put, without
     reference to the Colonial Government, for any larger sums perhaps
     the colonial sanction should be taken."I urge that this measure of satisfying the Loyals is one that
     presses and cannot well wait months to be settled."In conclusion, I recommend (1) that a National Pitso be held;
     (2) that the Loyals should at once be paid off."I feel confident that by the recommendation No.1 nothing could
     be asked for detrimental to colonial interests, whose Government
     would always have the right of amending or refusing any demands,
     and that by recommendation No.2 a great moral effect would be
     produced at once, and some heavy expenses saved."Attached to this memorandum was the draft of a proclamation to the
chiefs, etc., of Basutoland, calling on them to meet in Pitso or
National Assembly without any agent of the Colonial Government being
present.It was not very surprising that such a policy of fairness and
consideration for Basuto opinion, because so diametrically opposite to
everything that Government had been doing, should have completely
taken the Cape authorities aback, nor were its chances of being
accepted increased by Gordon entrusting it to Mr Orpen, whose policy
in the matter had been something more than criticised by the Ministers
at that moment in power at the Cape.Gordon's despatch was in the
hands of the Cape Premier early in June, and the embarrassment he felt
at the ability and force with which the Basuto side of the question
was put by the officer, who was to settle the matter for the Cape
Government, was so great that, instead of making any reply, he passed
it on to Lord Kimberley and the Colonial Office for solution.It was
not until the 7th of August that an answer was vouchsafed to Gordon on
what was, after all, the main portion of his task in South Africa.In
the interval Gordon was employed on different military and
administrative matters, for he had had thrust on him as a temporary
charge the functions of Commandant-General of the Cape forces, which
he had never wished to accept, but it will be clearer to the reader to
follow to the end the course of his Basuto mission, which was the
essential cause of his presence in South Africa.On the 18th July the Ministers requested Gordon to go up to
Basutoland.At that moment, and indeed for more than three weeks
later, Gordon had received no reply to the detailed memorandum already
quoted.He responded to this request with the draft of a convention
that would "save the susceptibilities of Mr Orpen between whom and
Masupha any _entente_ would seem impossible."The basis of that
convention was to be the semi-independence of the Basutos, but its
full text must be given in order to show the consistency, as well as
the simplicity, of Gordon's proposed remedy of a question that had
gone on for years without any prospect of termination.CONVENTION BETWEEN COLONY, CAPE
