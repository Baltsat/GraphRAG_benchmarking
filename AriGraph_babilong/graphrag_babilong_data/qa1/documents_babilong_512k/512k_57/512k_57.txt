But that if there were any Bodies in
the world, or els any intelligences, or other Natures which were not
wholly perfect, their being must depend from his power in such a manner,
that they could not subsist one moment without him.Thence I went in search of other Truths; and having proposed _Geometry_
for my object, which I conceived as a continued Body, or a space
indefinitely spred in length, bredth, height or depth, divisible into
divers parts, which might take severall figures and bignesses, and be
moved and transposed every way.For the Geometricians suppose all this
in their object.I past through some of their most simple
demonstrations; and having observed that this great certaintie, which
all the world grants them, is founded only on this, that men evidently
conceived them, following the rule I already mentioned.I observed also
that there was nothing at all in them which ascertain'd me of the
existence of their object.As for example, I well perceive, that
supposing a Triangle, three angles necessarily must be equall to two
right ones: but yet nevertheless I saw nothing which assured me that
there was a Triangle in the world.Whereas returning to examine the
_Idea_ which I had of a perfect Being, _I_ found its existence comprised
in it, in the same manner as it was comprised in that of a Triangle,
where the three angles are equall to two right ones; or in that of a
sphere, where all the parts are equally distant from the center.Or even
yet more evidently, and that by consequence, it is at least as certain
that God, who is that perfect Being, is, or exists, as any demonstration
in Geometry can be.But that which makes many perswade themselves that there is difficulty
in knowing it, as also to know what their Soul is, 'tis that they never
raise their thoughts beyond sensible things, and that they are so
accustomed to consider nothing but by imagination, which is a particular
manner of thinking on materiall things, that whatsoever is not
imaginable seems to them not intelligible.Which is manifest enough from
this, that even the Philosophers hold for a Maxime in the Schools, That
there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense;
where notwithstanding its certain, that the _Ideas_ of God and of the
Soul never were.And (me thinks) those who use their imagination to
comprehend them, are just as those, who to hear sounds, or smell odours,
would make use of their eys; save that there is yet this difference,
That the sense of seeing assures us no lesse of the truth of its
objects, then those of smelling or hearing do: whereas neither our
imagination, nor our senses, can ever assure us of any thing, if our
understanding intervenes not.To be short, if there remain any who are not enough perswaded of the
existence of God, and of their soul, from the reasons I have produc'd, I
would have them know, that all other things, whereof perhaps they think
themselves more assured, as to have a body, and that there are Stars,
and an earth, and the like, are less certain.For although we had such a
morall assurance of these things, that without being extravagant we
could not doubt of them.However, unless we be unreasonable when a
metaphysicall certainty is in question, we cannot deny but we have cause
enough not to be wholly confirmed in them, when we consider that in the
same manner we may imagine being asleep, we have other bodies, and that
we see other Stars, and another earth, though there be no such thing.For how doe we know that those thoughts which we have in our dreams,
are rather false then the others, seeing often they are no less lively
and significant, and let the ablest men study it as long as they please,
I beleeve they can give no sufficient reason to remove this doubt,
unless they presuppose the existence of God.For first of all, that
which I even now took for a rule, to wit, that those things which were
most clearly and distinctly conceived, are all true, is certain, only by
reason, that God is or exists, and that he is a perfect being, and that
all which we have comes from him.Whence it follows, that our Idea's or
notions, being reall things, and which come from God in all wherein they
are clear and distinct, cannot therein be but true.So that if we have
very often any which contain falshood, they cannot be but of such things
which are somewhat confus'd and obscure, because that therein they
signifie nothing to us, that's to say, that they are thus confus'd in us
only, because we are not wholly perfect.And it's evident that there is
no less contrariety that falshood and imperfection should proceed from
God, as such, then there is in this, that truth and falshood proceed
from nothing.But if we know not that whatsoever was true and reall in
us comes from a perfect and infinite being, how clear and distinct
soever our Idea's were, we should have no reason to assure us, that they
had the perfection to be true.Now after that the knowledge of God, and of the Soul hath rendred us
thus certain of this rule, it's easie to know; that the extravaganceys
which we imagin in our sleep, ought no way to make us doubt of the truth
of those thoughts which we have being awake: For if it should happen,
that even sleeping we should have a very distinct Idea; as for example,
A Geometritian should invent some new demonstration, his sleeping would
not hinder it to be true.And for the most ordinary error of our
dreames, which consists in that they represent unto us severall objects
in the same manner as our exterior senses doe, it matters not though it
give us occasion to mistrust the truth of those Ideas, because that they
may also often enough cozen us when we doe not sleep; As when to those
who have the Jaundies, all they see seems yellow; or, as the Stars or
other bodies at a distance, appear much less then they are.For in fine,
whether we sleep or wake, we ought never to suffer our selves to be
perswaded but by the evidence of our Reason; I say, (which is
observable) Of our Reason, and not of our imagination, or of our senses.As although we see the Sun most clearly, we are not therefore to judge
him to be of the bigness we see him of; and we may well distinctly
imagine the head of a Lion, set on the body of a Goat, but therefore we
ought not to conclude that there is a _Chimera_ in the world.For reason
doth not dictate to us, that what we see or imagine so, is true: But it
dictates, that all our Idea's or notions ought to have some grounds of
truth; For it were not possible, that God who is all perfect, and all
truth, should have put them in us without that: And because that our
reasonings are never so evident, nor so entire while we sleep, as when
we wake, although sometimes our imaginations be then as much or more
lively and express.It also dictates to us, that our thoughts, seeing
they cannot be all true by reason that we are not wholly perfect; what
they have of truth, ought infallibly to occur in those which we have
being awake, rather then in our dreams.V.


I should be glad to pursue this Discourse, and shew you the whole Series
of the following Truths, which I have drawn from the former: But because
for this purpose, it were now necessary for me to treat of severall
questions, which are controverted by the learned, with whom I have no
desire to imbroil my self, I beleeve it better for me to abstain from
it; and so in generall onely to discover what they are, that I may leave
the wisest to judge whether it were profitable to inform the publick
more particularly of them.I alwayes remained constant to my resolution,
to suppose no other Principle but that which I now made use of, for the
demonstration of the Existence of God, and of the Soul; and to receive
nothing for true, which did not seem to me more clear and more certain
then the demonstrations of Geometry had formerly done.And yet I dare
say, that I have not onely found out the means to satisfie my self, in a
short time, concerning all the principall difficulties which are usually
treated in Philosophy.But that also _I_ have observed certain Laws
which God hath so established in Nature, and of which he hath imprinted
such notions in our Souls, that when we shall have made sufficient
reflections upon them we cannot doubt but that they are exactly observed
in whatsoever either is, or is done in the World.Then considering the
connexion of these Laws, me thinks, I have discovercd divers Truths,
more usefull and important then whatever _I_ learn'd before, or ever
hop'd to learn.But because _I_ have endeavoured to lay open the principall of them in a
Treatise, which some considerations hinder me from publishing; _I_ can
no way better make them known, then by relating summarily what it
contains.I had a designe to comprehend all what I thought _I_ knew, before _I_
would write it, touching the nature of material things.But even as
Painters, not being able equally well to represent upon a _flat_ all the
severall facies of a solid body, chuse the principall of them, which
they place towards the light; and shadowing the others, make them appear
no more then they do to our sight: So, fearing lest _I_ should not bring
into this Discourse all which was in my thoughts, _I_ onely undertook to
set forth at large my conceptions touching the light; and upon that
occasion to add somewhat of the Sun, and of the fix'd Stars, by reason
that it proceeds almost all from thence; of the Heavens, because they
transmit it; of the Planets, of the Comets, and of the Earth, because
they cause it to reflect; and in particular, of all Bodies which are on
the earth, whether for that they are either coloured, or transparent, or
luminous; and last of all, of Man, because he is the Spectator thereof.As also, in some manner to shadow out all these things, and that _I_
might the more freely speak what _I_ judg'd, without being obliged to
follow, or to refute the opinions which are received amongst the
Learned, _I_ resolved to leave all this world here to their disputes,
and to speak onely of what would happen in a new one, if God now created
some where in those imaginary spaces matter enough to compose it, and
that he diversly and without order agitated the severall parts of this
matter, so as to compose a Chaos of it as confused as the Poets could
feign one: and that afterwards he did nothing but lend his ordinary
concurrence to Nature, and leave her to work according to the Laws he
hath established.Thus first of all _I_ described this Matter, and endevoured to
represent it such, that me thinks there is nothing in the world more
clear, or more intelligible, except what was beforesaid of God, and of
the Soul.For even _I_ expresly supposed that there was in it none of
those forms and qualities which are disputed in the Schools; nor
generally any thing but that the knowledge thereof was so naturall to
our understandings, that we could not even feigne to be ignorant of it.Besides, I made known what the Laws of Nature were; and without
grounding my reasons on any other principles, but on the infinite
perfections of God, I did endeavour to demonstrate all those which might
be questioned, and to make them appear to be such, that although God had
created divers worlds, there could have been none where they were not
observed.Afterwards _I_ shewed how the greater part of the Matter of
this _Chaos_ ought, according to those Laws, to dispose and order it
self in a certain manner, which would make it like our Heavens: And how
some of these parts were to compose an Earth, and some Planets and
Commets, some others a Sun and fix'd Starrs.And here enlarging my self
on the subject of Light, _I_ at length explain'd what that light was,
which was to be in the Sun and Stars; and thence how it travers'd in an
instant the immense spaces of the Heavens, and how it reflected it self
from Planets and Commets towards the Earth._I_ added also divers things
touching the substance, situation, the motions, and all the several
qualities of these heavens and these stars: So that _I_ thought _I_ had
said enough to make known, That there is nothing remarkable in those of
this world, which ought not, or at least could not appear altogether
like to these of that world which _I_ described.Thence _I_ came to speak particularly of the Earth; how, although I had
expresly supposed, that God had placed no weight in the Matter whereof
it was composed; yet all its parts exactly tended towards its center:
How that there being water and air upon its superficies, the disposition
of the Heavens, and of the Starrs, and chiefly of the Moon, ought to
cause a floud and an ebb, which in all circumstances was like to that
which we observe in our Seas; And besides, a certain course aswel of the
water, as of the air, from East to West, as is also observed between the
Tropicks: How the Mountains, the Seas, the Springs and Rivers might
naturally be form'd therein, and Metals run in the mines, and Plants
grow in the Fields, and generally all bodies be therein engendered which
are call'd mixt or composed.And amongst other things, because that next the Stars, I know nothing in
the world but Fire, which produceth light, I studied to make all clearly
understood which belongs to its nature; how it's made, how it's fed,
how sometimes it hath heat onely without light, and sometimes onely
light without heat; how it can introduce several colours into several
bodies, and divers other qualities; how it dissolves some, and hardens
others; how it can consume almost all, or convert them into ashes and
smoak: and last of all, how of those ashes, by the only violence of its
action, it forms glass.For this transmutation of ashes into glass,
seeming to me to be as admirable as any other operation in Nature, I
particularly took pleasure to describe it.Yet would I not inferre from all these things, that this World was
created after the manner I had proposed.For it is more probable that
God made it such as it was to be, from the beginning.But it's certain,
and 'tis an opinion commonly received amongst the Divines, That the
action whereby he now preserveth it, is the same with that by which he
created it.So that, although at the beginning he had given it no other
form but that of a Chaos (provided, that having established the Laws of
Nature, he had afforded his concurrence to it, to work as it used to do)
we may beleeve (without doing wrong to the miracle of the Creation) that
by that alone all things which are purely material might in time have
rendred themselves such as we now see them: and their nature is far
easier to conceive, when by little and little we see them brought forth
so, then when we consider them quite form'd all at once.From the description of inanimate Bodies and Plants, I pass'd to that of
Animals, and particularly to that of Men.But because I had not yet
knowledge enough to speak of them in the same stile as of the others; to
wit, in demonstrating effects by their causes, and shewing from what
seeds, and in what manner Nature ought to produce them; I contented my
self to suppose, That God form'd the body of a Man altogether like one
of ours; aswel the exteriour figure of its members, as in the interiour
conformity of its organs; without framing it of other matter then of
that which I had described; and without putting in it at the beginning
any reasonable soul, or any other thing to serve therein for a
vegetative or sensitive soul; unless he stirr'd up in his heart one of
those fires without light which I had already discovered; and that I
conceiv'd of no other nature but that which heats hay when its housed
before it be dry, or which causes new Wines to boyl when it works upon
the grape: For examining the functions which might be consequently in
this body, I exactly found all those which may be in us, without our
thinking of them; and to which our soul (that is to say, that distinct
part from our bodies, whose nature (as hath been said before) is onely
to think) consequently doth not contribute, and which are all the same
wherein we may say unreasonable creatures resemble us.Yet could I not
finde any, of those which depending from the thought, are the onely ones
which belong unto us as Men; whereas I found them all afterwards, having
supposed that God created a reasonable soul, and that he joyn'd it to
this body, after a certain manner which I describ'd.But that you might see how I treated this matter, I shall here present
you with the explication of the motion of the heart, and of the
arteries, which being the first and most general (which is observed in
animals) we may thereby easily judge what we ought to think of all the
rest.And that we may have the less difficulty to understand what I
shall say thereof, I wish those who are not versed in Anatomy, would
take the pains, before they read this, to cause the heart of some great
animal which hath lungs, to be dissected; for in all of them its very
like that of a Man: and that they may have shewn them the two cels or
concavities which are there: First that on the right side, whereto two
large conduits answer, to wit, the _vena cava_, which is the principal
receptacle of bloud, and as the body of a tree, whereof all the other
veins of the body are branches; and the arterious vein, which was so
mis-call'd, because that in effect its an artery, which taking its
_origine_ from the heart, divides it self after being come forth, into
divers branches, which every way spred themselves through the lungs.Then the other which is on the left side, whereunto in the same manner
two pipes answer, which are as large, or larger then the former; to wit,
the veinous artery, which was also il named, forasmuch as its nothing
else but a vein which comes from the lungs, where its divided into
several branches interlaid with those of the arterious vein, and those
of that pipe which is called the Whistle, by which the breath enters.And the great artery, which proceeding from the heart, disperseth its
branches thorow all the body.I would also that they would carefully
observe the eleven little skins, which, as so many little doors, open
and shut the four openings which are in these two concavities; to wit,
three at the entry of the _vena cava_, where they are so disposed, that
they can no wayes hinder the bloud which it contains from running into
the right concavity of the heart; and yet altogether hinder it from
coming out.Three at the entry of the arterious vein; which being
disposed quite contrary, permit only the bloud which is in that
concavity to pass to the lungs; but not that which is in the lungs to
return thither.And then two others at the entry of the veinous artery,
which permits the bloud to run to the left concavity of the heart, but
opposeth its return.And three at the entry of the great artery, which
permit it to go from the heart, but hinder its return thither.Neither
need we seek any other reason for the number of these skins, save only
that the opening of the veinous artery, being oval-wise, by reason of
its situation, may be fitly shut with two; whereas the other, being
round, may the better be clos'd with three.Besides, I would have them
consider, that the great artery and the arterious vein are of a
composition much stronger then the veinous artery or the _vena cava_.And that these two later grow larger before they enter into the heart,
and make (as it were) two purses, call'd the ears of the heart, which
are composed of a flesh like it; and that there is always more heat in
the heart then in any other part of the body.And in fine, that if any
drop of bloud enter into these concavities, this heat is able to make it
presently swell and dilate it self, as generally all liquors do, when
drop by drop we let them fall into a very hot vessel.For after this I need say no more for to unfold the motion of the
heart, but that when these concavities are not full of bloud,
necessarily there runs some from the _vena cava_ into the right, and
from the veinous artery into the left; for that these two vessels are
always full of it, and that their openings which are towards the heart
cannot then be shut: But that assoon as there is thus but two drops of
bloud entred, one in either of these concavities, these drops, which
cannot but be very big, by reason that their openings whereby they enter
are very large, and the vessels whence they come very full of bloud, are
rarified and dilated because of the heat which they find therein.By
means whereof, causing all the heart to swel, they drive and shut the
five little doors which are at the entry of the two vessels whence they
come, hindering thereby any more bloud to fall down into the heart, and
continuing more and more to rarifie themselves, they drive and open the
six other little doors which are at the entry of the other two vessels
whence they issue, causing by that means all the branches of the
arterious vein, and of the great artery, to swel (as it were) at the
same time with the heart: which presently after fals, as those arteries
also do, by reason that the bloud which is entred therein grows colder,
and their six little doors shut up again, and those five of the _vena
cava_, and of the veinous artery open again, and give way to two other
drops of bloud, which again swell the heart and the arteries in the same
manner as the preceding did.And because the bloud which thus enters
into the heart, passeth thorow those two purses, which are call'd the
ears; thence it comes, that their motion is contrary to the heart's, and
that they fall when that swels.Lastly, That they who know not the force of Mathematical demonstrations,
and are not accustomed to distinguish true reasons from probable ones,
may not venture to deny this without examining it, I shall advertise
them, that this motion which I have now discovered, as necessarily
follows from the onely disposition of the organs (which may plainly be
seen in the heart,) and from the heat (which we may feel with our
fingers,) and from the nature of the bloud (which we may know by
experience,) as the motions of a clock doth by the force, situation and
figure of its weight and wheels.But if it be asked, how it comes that the bloud of the veins is not
exhausted, running so continually into the heart; and how that the
arteries are not too full, since all that which passeth thorow the heart
dischargeth it self into them: I need answer nothing thereto but what
hath been already writ by an English Physician, to whom this praise must
be given, to have broken the ice in this place, and to be the first who
taught us, That there are several little passages in the extremity of
the arteries whereby the bloud which they receive from the heart,
enters the little branches of the veins; whence again it sends it self
back towards the heart: so that its course is no other thing but a
perpetuall circulation.Which he very wel proves by the ordinary
experience of Chirurgians, who having bound the arm indifferently hard
above the the place where they open the vein, which causeth the bloud to
issue more abundantly, then if it had not been bound.And the contrary
would happen, were it bound underneath, between the hand and the
incision, or bound very hard above.For its manifest, that the band
indifferently tyed, being able to hinder the bloud which is already in
the arm to return towards the heart by the veins; yet it therefore
hinders not the new from coming always by the arteries, by reason they
are placed under the veins, and that their skin being thicker, are less
easie to be press'd, as also that the bloud which comes from the heart,
seeks more forcibly to passe by them towards the hand, then it doth to
return from thence towards the heart by the veins.And since this bloud
which issues from the arm by the incision made in one of the veins, must
necessarily have some passage under the bond, to wit, towards the
extremities of the arm, whereby it may come thither by the arteries, he
also proves very well what he sayes of the course of the bloud through
certain little skins, which are so disposed in divers places along the
veins, which permit it not to pass from the middle towards the
extremities, but onely to return from the extremities towards the heart.And besides this, experience shews, That all the bloud which is in the
body may in a very little time run out by one onely artery's being cut,
although it were even bound very neer the heart, and cut betwixt it and
the ligature: So that we could have no reason to imagine that the bloud
which issued thence could come from any other part.But there are divers other things which witness, that the true cause of
this motion of the bloud is that which I have related.As first, The
difference observed between that which issues out of the veins, and that
which comes out of the arteries, cannot proceed but from its being
rarified and (as it were) distilled by passing thorow the heart: its
more subtil, more lively, and more hot presently after it comes out;
that is to say, being in the arteries, then it is a little before it
enters them, that is to say, in the veins.And if you observe, you will
finde, that this difference appears not well but about the heart; and
not so much in those places which are farther off.Next, the hardnesse
of the skin of which the artery vein and the great artery are composed,
sheweth sufficiently, that the bloud beats against them more forcibly
then against the veins.And why should the left concavity of the heart,
and the great artery be more large and ample then the right concavity,
and the arterious vein; unless it were that the bloud of the veinous
artery, having bin but onely in the lungs since its passage thorow the
heart, is more subtil, and is rarified with more force and ease then the
bloud which immediately comes from the _vena cava_.And what can the
Physicians divine by feeling of the pulse, unlesse they know, that
according as the bloud changeth its nature, it may by the heat of the
heart be rarified to be more or lesse strong, and more or lesse quick
then before.And if we examine how this heat is communicated to the
other members, must we not avow that 'tis by means of the bloud, which
passing the heart, reheats it self there, and thence disperseth it self
thorow the whole body: whence it happens, that if you take away the
bloud from any part, the heat by the same means also is taken a way.And
although the heart were as burning as hot iron, it were not sufficient
to warm the feet and the hands so often as it doth, did it not continue
to furnish them with new bloud.Besides, from thence we know also that the true use of respiration is to
bring fresh air enough to the lungs, to cause that bloud which comes
from the right concavity of the heart, where it was rarified, and (as it
were) chang'd into vapours, there to thicken, and convert it self into
bloud again, before it fall again into the left, without which it would
not be fit to serve for the nourishment of the fire which is there.Which is confirm'd, for that its seen, that animals which have no lungs
have but one onely concavity in the heart; and that children, who can
make no use of them when they are in their mothers bellies, have an
opening, by which the bloud of the _vena cava_ runs to the left
concavity of the heart, and a conduit by which it comes from the
arterious vein into the great artery without passing the lungs.Next, How would the concoction be made in the stomach, unlesse the heart
sent heat by the arteries, and therewithall some of the most fluid parts
of the bloud, which help to dissolve the meat receiv'd therein?and is
not the act which converts the juice of these meats into bloud easie to
be known, if we consider, that it is distill'd by passing and repassing
the heart, perhaps more then one or two hundred times a day?And what
need we ought else to explain the nutrition and the production of divers
humours which are in the body, but to say, that the force wherewith the
bloud in rarifying it self, passeth from the heart towards the
extremities or the arteries, causeth some of its parts to stay amongst
those of the members where they are, and there take the place of some
others, which they drive from thence?And that according to the
situation, or the figure, or the smalnesse of the pores which they
meet, some arrive sooner in one place then others.In the same manner
as we may have seen in severall sieves, which being diversly pierc'd,
serve to sever divers grains one from the other.And briefly, that which
is most remarkable herein, is the generation of the animal spirits,
which are as a most subtil wind, or rather, as a most pure and lively
flame, which continually rising in great abundance from the heart to the
brain, dischargeth it self thence by the nerves into the muscles, and
gives motion to all the members; without imagining any other reason
which might cause these parts of the bloud, which being most mov'd, and
the most penetrating, are the most fit to form these spirits, tend
rather towards the brain, then to any other part.Save onely that the
arteries which carry them thither, are those which come from the heart
in the most direct line of all: And that according to the rules of the
Mechanicks, which are the same with those of Nature, when divers things
together strive to move one way, where there is not room enough for all;
so those parts of bloud which issue from the left concavity of the heart
tend towards the brain, the weaker and less agitated are expell'd by the
stronger, who by that means arrive there alone.I had particularly enough expounded all these things in a Treatise which
I formerly had design'd to publish: In pursuit whereof, I had therein
shewed what ought to be the fabrick of the nerves and muscles of an
humane body, to cause those animall spirits which were in them, to have
the power to move those members.As we see that heads a while after they
are cut off, yet move of themselves, and bite the ground, although they
are not then animated.What changes ought to be made in the brain to
cause waking, sleeping, and dreaming: how light, sounds, smels, tasts,
heat, and all other qualities of exteriour objects, might imprint
severall _Ideas_ by means of the senses.How hunger and thirst, and the
other interiour passions might also send theirs thither.What ought to
be taken therein for common sense, where these _Ideas_ are received; for
memory which preserves them; and for fancy, which can diversly change
them, and form new ones of them; and by the same means, distributing the
animal spirits into the muscles, make the members of the body move in so
many severall fashions, and as fitly to those objects which present
themselves to its senses; and to the interiour passions which are in
them, as ours may move themselves without the consent of the Wil.Which
wil seem nothing strange to those, who knowing how many _Automatas_ or
moving Machines the industry of men can make, imploying but very few
pieces, in comparison of the great abundance of bones, muscles, nerves,
arteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every
Animal, will consider this body as a fabrick, which having been made by
the hands of God, is incomparably better ordered, and hath more
admirable motions in it then any of those which can be invented by men.And herein I particularly insisted, to make it appear, that if there
were such Machines which had organs, and the exteriour figure of an Ape,
or of any other unreasonable creature, we should finde no means of
knowing them not to be altogether of the same nature as those Animals:
whereas, if there were any which resembled our bodies, and imitated our
actions as much as morally it were possible, we should always have two
most certain ways to know, that for all that they were not reall men:
The first of which is, that they could never have the use of speech, nor
of other signes in framing it, as we have, to declare our thoughts to
others: for we may well conceive, that a Machine may be so made, that it
may utter words, and even some proper to the corporal actions, which
may cause some change in its organs; as if we touch it in some part, and
it should ask what we would say; or so as it might cry out that one
hurts it, and the like: but not that they can diversifie them to answer
sensibly to all what shall be spoken in its presence, as the dullest men
may do.And the second is, That although they did divers things aswel,
or perhaps better, then any of us, they must infallibly fail in some
others, whereby we might discover that they act not with knowledge, but
onely by the disposition of their organs: for whereas Reason is an
universal instrument which may serve in all kinde of encounters, these
organs have need of some particular disposition for every particular
action: whence it is, that its morally impossible for one Machine to
have severall organs enough to make it move in all the occurrences of
this life, in the same manner as our Reason makes us move.Now by these
two means we may also know the difference which is between Men and
Beasts: For 'tis a very remarkable thing, that there are no men so dull
and so stupid, without excepting those who are out of their wits, but
are capable to rank severall words together, and of them to compose a
Discourse, by which they make known their thoughts: and that on the
contrary, there is no other creature, how perfect or happily soever
brought forth, which can do the like.The which happens, not because
they want organs; for we know, that Pyes and Parrots can utter words
even as we can, and yet cannot speak like us; that is to say, with
evidence that they think what they say.Whereas Men, being born deaf and
dumb, and deprived of those organs which seem to make others speak, as
much or more then beasts, usually invent of themselves to be understood
by those, who commonly being with them, have the leisure to learn their
expressions.And this not onely witnesseth, that Beasts have lesse
reason than men, but that they have none at all.For we see there needs
not much to learn to speak: and forasmuch as we observe inequality
amongst Beasts of the same kind, aswell as amongst men, and that some
are more easily managed then others; 'tis not to be believed, but that
an Ape or a Parrot which were the most perfect of its kinde, should
therein equall the most stupid child, or at least a child of a
distracted brain, if their souls were not of a nature wholly different
from ours.And we ought not to confound words with naturall motions,
which witness passions, and may be imitated by Machines aswell as by
Animals; nor think (as some of the Ancients) that beasts speak, although
we do not understand their language: for if it were true, since they
have divers organs which relate to ours, they could aswell make
themselves understood by us, as by their like.Its likewise very
remarkable that although there are divers creatures which express more
industry then we in some one of their actions; yet we may well perceive,
that the same shew none at all in many others: So that what they do
better then we, proves not at all that they have reason; for by that
reckoning they would have more then any of us, and would do better in
all other things; but rather, that they have none at all, and that its
Nature onely which works in them according to the disposition of their
organs.As wee see a Clock, which is onely composed of wheels and
springs, can reckon the hours, and measure the times more exactly then
we can with all our prudence.After this I had described the reasonable Soul, and made it appear, that
it could no way be drawn from the power of the Matter, as other things
whereof I had spoken; but that it ought to have been expresly created:
And how it suffiseth not for it to be lodg'd in our humane body as a
Pilot in his ship, to move its members onely; but also that its
necessary it be joyned and united more strongly therewith to have
thoughts and appetites like ours, and so make a reall man.I have here dilated my self a little on the subject of the Soul, by
reason 'tis of most importance; for, next the errour of those who deny
God, which I think I have already sufficiently confuted, there is none
which sooner estrangeth feeble minds from the right way of vertue, then
to imagine that the soul of beasts is of the same nature as ours, and
that consequently we have nothing to fear nor hope after this life, no
more then flies or ants.Whereas, when we know how different they are,
we comprehend much better the reasons which prove that ours is of a
nature wholly independing from the body, and consequently that it is not
subject to die with it.And that when we see no other cause which
destroys it, we are naturally thence moved to judge that it's immortall.Its now three years since I ended the Treatise which contains all these
things, and that I began to review it, to send it afterwards to the
Presse, when I understood, that persons to whom I submit, and whose
authority can no lesse command my actions, then my own Reason doth my
thoughts, had disapproved an opinion in Physicks, published a little
before by another; of which I will not say that I was, but that indeed I
had observed nothing therein, before their censure, which I could have
imagined prejudiciall either to Religion or the State; or consequently,
which might have hindred me from writing the same, had my Reason
perswaded mee thereto.And this made me fear, lest in the same manner
there might be found some one amongst mine, in which I might have been
mistaken; notwithstanding the great care I always had to admit no new
ones into my belief, of which I had not most certain demonstrations; and
not to write such as might turn to the disadvantage of any body.Which
was sufficient to oblige me to change my resolution of publishing them.For although the reasons for which I had first of all taken it, were
very strong; yet my inclination, which alwayes made me hate the trade of
Book-making, presently found me out others enough to excuse my self from
it.And these reasons on the one and other side are such, that I am not
only somewhat concern'd to speak them; but happily the Publick also to
know them.I never did much esteem those things which proceeded from mine own
brain; and so long as I have gathered no other fruits from the Method I
use, but onely that I have satisfied my self in some difficulties which
belong to speculative Sciences, or at least endeavoured to regulate my
Manners by the reasons it taught me, I thought my self not obliged to
write any thing of them.For, as for what concerns Manners, every one
abounds so much in his own sense, That we may finde as many Reformers as
heads, were it permitted to others, besides those whom God hath
established as Soveraigns over his people, or at least, to whom he hath
dispensed grace and zeal enough to be Prophets, to undertake the change
of any thing therein.And although my Speculations did very much please
me, I did beleeve that other men also had some, which perhaps pleas'd
them more.But as soon as I had acquired some generall notions touching
naturall Philosophy, and beginning to prove them in divers particular
difficulties, I observed how far they might lead a man, and how far
different they were from the principles which to this day are in use; I
judg'd, that I could not keep them hid without highly sinning against
the Law, which obligeth us to procure, as much as in us lies, the
general good of all men.For they made it appear to me, that it was
possible to attain to points of knowledge, which may be very profitable
for this life: and that in stead of this speculative Philosophy which is
taught in the Schools, we might finde out a practicall one, by which
knowing the force and workings of Fire, Water, Air, of the Starrs, of
the Heavens, and of all other Bodies which environ us, distinctly, as we
know the several trades of our Handicrafts, we might in the same manner
employ them to all uses to which they are fit, and so become masters and
possessours of Nature.Which is not onely to be desired for the
invention of very many expedients of Arts, which without trouble might
make us enjoy the fruits of the earth, and all the conveniences which
are to be found therein: But chiefly also for the preservation of
health, which (without doubt) is the first good, and the foundation of
all other good things in this life.For even the minde depends so much
on the temper and disposition of the organs of the body, that if it be
possible to finde any way of making men in the generall wiser, and more
able then formerly they were, I beleeve it ought to be sought in
Physick.True it is, that which is now in use contains but few things,
whose benefit is very remarkable: But (without any designe of slighting
of it) I assure my self, there is none, even of their own profession,
but will consent, that whatsoever is known therein, is almost nothing in
companion of what remains to be known.And that we might be freed from
very many diseases, aswell of the body as of the mind, and even also
perhaps from the weaknesses of old age, had we but knowledge enough of
their Causes, and of all the Remedies wherewith Nature hath furnished
us.Now having a designe to employ all my life in the enquiry of so
necessary a Science; and having found a way, the following of which me
thinks might infallibly lead us to it, unless we be hindred by the
shortness of life, or by defect of experiments.I judg'd that there was
no better Remedie against those two impediments, but faithfully to
communicate to the publique, all that little I should discover, and to
invite all good Wits to endevour to advance farther in contributing
every one, according to his inclination and power, to those Experiments
which are to be made, and communicating also to the publique all the
things they should learn; so that the last, beginning where the
precedent ended, and so joyning the lives and labors of many in one, we
might all together advance further then any particular Man could do.I also observ'd touching Experiments, that they are still so much the
more necessary, as we are more advanc'd in knowledg.For in the
beginning it's better to use those only which of themselves are
presented to our senses, and which we cannot be ignorant of, if we do
but make the least reflections upon them, then to seek out the rarest
and most studied ones.The reason whereof is, that those which are
rarest, doe often deceive, when we seldome know the same of the most
common ones, and that the circumstances on which they depend, are, as it
were, always so particular, and so small, that it's very uneasie to
finde them out.First, I
endevoured to finde in generall the Principles or first Causes of
whatsoever is or may be in the world, without considering any thing for
this end, but God alone who created it, or drawing them elsewhere, then
from certain seeds of Truth which naturally are in our souls.After
this, I examined what were the first and most ordinary Effects which
might be deduced from these Causes: And me thinks that thereby I found
out Heavens, Starrs, an Earth; and even on the Earth, Water, Air and
Fire, Minerals, and some other such like things, which are the most
common, and the most simple of all, and consequently the most easie to
be understood.Afterwards, when I would descend to those which were more
particular, there were so many severall ones presented themselves to me,
that I did beleeve it impossible for a humane understanding to
distinguish the forms and species of Bodies which are on the earth, from
an infinite number of others which might be there, had it been the will
of God so to place them: Nor by consequence to apply them to our use,
unless we set the Effects before the Causes, and make use of divers
particular experiments; In relation to which, revolving in my minde all
those objects which ever were presented to my senses, I dare boldly say,
I observed nothing which I could not fitly enough explain by the
principles I had found.But I must also confesse that the power of
Nature is so ample and vast, and these principles are so simple and
generall, that I can observe almost no particular Effect, but that I
presently know it might be deduced from thence in many severall ways:
and that commonly my greatest difficulty is to finde in which of these
ways it depends thereon; for I know no other expedient for that, but
again to seek some experiments, which may be such, that their event may
not be the same, if it be in one of those ways which is to be exprest,
as if it were in another.In fine, I am gotten so far, That (me thinks)
I see well enough what course we ought to hold to make the most part of
those experiments which may tend to this effect.But I also see they
are such, and of so great a number, that neither my hands nor my estate
(though I had a thousand times more then I have) could ever suffice for
all.So that according as I shall hereafter have conveniency to make
more or fewer of them, I shall also advance more or lesse in the
knowledge of Nature, which I hop'd I should make known by the Treatise
which I had written; and therein so clearly shew the benefit which the
Publick may receive thereby, that I should oblige all those in general
who desire the good of Mankinde; that is to say, all those who are
indeed vertuous, (and not so seemingly, or by opinion only) aswell to
communicate such experiments as they have already made, as to help me in
the enquiry of those which are to be made.But since that time, other reasons have made me alter my opinion, and
think that I truly ought to continue to write of all those things which
I judg'd of any importance, according as I should discover the truth of
them, and take the same care, as if I were to print them; as well that I
might have so much the more occasion throughly to examine them; as
without doubt, we always look more narrowly to what we offer to the
publick view, then to what we compose onely for our own use: and
oftentimes the same things which seemed true to me when I first
conceived them, appear'd afterwards false to me, when I was committing
them to paper: as also that I might lose no occasion of benefiting the
Publick, if I were able, and that if my Writings were of any value,
those to whose hands they should come after my death, might to make what
use of them they think fit.But that I ought not any wayes to consent that they should be published
during my life; That neither the opposition and controversies, whereto
perhaps they might be obnoxious, nor even the reputation whatsoever it
were, which they might acquire me, might give me any occasion of
mispending the time I had design'd to employ for my instruction; for
although it be true that every Man is oblig'd to procure, as much as in
him lies, the good of others; and that to be profitable to no body, is
properly to be good for nothing: Yet it's as true, that our care ought
to reach beyond the present time; and that it were good to omit those
things which might perhaps conduce to the benefit of those who are
alive, when our designe is, to doe others which shall prove farr more
advantagious to our posterity; As indeed I desire it may be known that
the little I have learnt hitherto, is almost nothing in comparison of
what I am ignorant of; and I doe not despair to be able to learn: For
it's even the same with those, who by little and little discover the
truth in Learning; as with those who beginning to grow rich, are less
troubled to make great purchases, then they were before when they were
poorer, to make little ones.Or else one may compare them to Generals of
Armies, whose Forces usually encrease porportionably to their Victories;
and who have need of more conduct to maintain themselves after the loss
of a battail, then after the gaining one, to take Towns and Provinces.For to endeavour to overcome all the difficulties and errours which
hinder us to come to the knowledg of the Truth, is truly to fight
battails.And to receive any false opinion touching a generall or
weighty matter, is as much as to lose one; there is far more dexterity
required to recover our former condition, then to make great progresses
where our Principles are already certain.For my part, if I formerly
have discovered some Truths in Learning, as I hope my Discourse will
make it appear I have, I may say, they are but the products and
dependances of five or six principall difficulties which I have
overcome, and which I reckon for so many won Battails on my side.Neither will I forbear to say; That I think, It's only necessary for me
to win two or three more such, wholly to perfect my design.And that I
am not so old, but according to the ordinary course of Nature, I may
have time enough to effect it.But I beleeve I am so much the more
obliged to husband the rest of my time, as I have more hopes to employ
it well; without doubt, I should have divers occasions of impeding it,
should I publish the grounds of my Physicks.For although they are
almost all so evident, that to beleeve them, it's needfull onely to
understand them; and that there is none whereof I think my self unable
to give demonstration.Yet because it's impossible that they should
agree with all the severall opinions of other men, I foresee I should
often be diverted by the opposition they would occasion.It may be objected, These oppositions might be profitable, as well to
make me know my faults, as if any thing of mine were good to make others
by that means come to a better understanding thereof; and as many may
see more then one man, beginning from this time to make use of my
grounds, they might also help me with their invention.But although I
know my self extremely subject to fail, and do never almost trust my
first thoughts; yet the experience I have of the objections which may be
made unto me, hinder me from hoping for any profit from them; For I have
often tried the judgments as well of those whom I esteem'd my friends,
as of others whom I thought indifferent, and even also of some, whose
malignity and envie did sufficiently discover what the affection of my
friends might hide.But it seldom happened that any thing was objected
against me, which I had not altogether foreseen, unless it were very
remote from my Subject: So that I never almost met with any Censurer of
my opinions, that seemed unto me either less rigorous, or less equitable
then my self.Neither did I ever observe, that by the disputations
practiced in the Schools any Truth which was formerly unknown, was ever
discovered.For whilest every one seeks to overcome, men strive more to
maintain probabilities, then to weigh the reasons on both sides; and
those who for a long time have been good Advocates, are not therefore
the better Judges afterwards.As for the benefit which others may receive from the communication of my
thoughts, it cannot also be very great, forasmuch as I have not yet
perfected them, but that it is necessary to add many things thereunto,
before a usefull application can be made of them.And I think I may say
without vanity, That if there be any one capable thereof, it must be my
self, rather then any other.Not but that there may be divers wits in
the world incomparably better then mine; but because men cannot so well
conceive a thing and make it their own, when they learn it of another,
as when they invent it themselves: which is so true in this Subject,
that although I have often explain'd some of my opinions to very
understanding men, and who, whilest I spake to them, seem'd very
distinctly to conceive them; yet when they repeated them, I observ'd,
that they chang'd them almost always in such a manner, that I could no
longer own them for mine.Upon which occasion, I shall gladly here
desire those who come after me, never to beleeve those things which may
be delivered to them for mine, when I have not published them my self.And I do not at all wonder at the extravagancies which are attributed to
all those ancient Philosophers, whose Writings we have not; neither do I
thereby judge, that their thoughts were very irrationall, seeing they
were the best Wits of their time; but onely that they have been ill
convey'd to us: as it appears also, that never any of their followers
surpass'd them.And I assure my self, that the most passionate of those,
who now follow _Aristotle_, would beleeve himself happy, had he but as
much knowledge of Nature as he had, although it were on condition that
he never might have more: They are like the ivie, which seeks to climb
no higher then the trees which support it, and ever after tends
downwards again when it hath attain'd to the height thereof: for, me
thinks also, that such men sink downwards; that is to say, render
themselves in some manner lesse knowing, then if they did abstain from
studying; who being not content to know all which is intelligibly set
down in their Authour, will besides that, finde out the solution of
divers difficulties of which he says nothing, and perhaps never thought
of them: yet their way of Philosophy is very fit for those who have but
mean capacities: For the obscurity of the distinctions and principles
which they use causeth them to speak of all things as boldly, as if they
knew them, and maintain all which they say, against the most subtill and
most able; so that there is no means left to convince them.Wherein they
seem like to a blinde man, who, to fight without disadvantage against
one that sees, should challenge him down into the bottom of a very dark
cellar: And I may say, that it is these mens interest, that I should
abstain from publishing the principles of the Philosophy I use, for
being most simple and most evident, as they are, I should even do the
same in publishing of them, as if I opened some windows, to let the day
into this cellar, into which they go down to fight.But even the best
Wits have no reason to wish for the knowledge of them: for if they will
be able to speak of all things, and acquire the reputation of being
learned, they will easily attain to it by contenting themselves with
probability, which without much trouble may be found in all kinde of
matters; then in seeking the Truth, which discovers it self but by
little and little, in some few things; and which, when we are to speak
of others, oblige us freely to confesse our ignorance of them.But if
they prefer the knowledge of some few truths to the vanity of seeming to
be ignorant of nothing, as without doubt they ought to do, and will
undertake a designe like mine, I need not tell them any more for this
purpose, but what I have already said in this Discourse: For if they
have a capacity to advance farther then I have done, they may with
greater consequence finde out of themselves whatsoever I think I have
found; Forasmuch as having never examined any thing but by order, it's
certain, that what remains yet for me to discover, is in it self more
difficult and more hid, then what I have already here before met with;
and they would receive much less satisfaction in learning it from me,
then from themselves.Besides that, the habit which they would get by
seeking first of all the easie things, and passing by degrees to others
more difficult, will be more usefull to them, then all my instructions.As I for my part am perswaded, that had I been taught from my youth all
the Truths whose demonstrations I have discovered since, and had taken
no pains to learn them, perhaps I should never have known any other, or
at least, I should never have acquired that habit, and that faculty
which I think I have, still to finde out new ones, as I apply my self to
the search of them.And in a word, if there be in the world any work
which cannot be so well ended by any other, as by the same who began it,
it's that which I am now about.It's true, That one man will not be sufficient to make all the
experiments which may conduce thereunto: But withall, he cannot
profitably imploy other hands then his own, unlesse it be those of
Artists, or others whom he hires, and whom the hope of profit (which is
a very powerfull motive) might cause exactly to do all those things he
should appoint them: For as for voluntary persons, who by curiosity or a
desire to learn, would perhaps offer themselves to his help, besides
that commonly they promise more then they perform, and make onely fair
propositions, whereof none ever succeeds, they would infallibly be paid
by the solution of some difficulties, or at least by complements and
unprofitable entertainments, which could not cost him so little of his
time, but he would be a loser thereby.And for the Experiments which
others have already made, although they would even communicate them to
him (which those who call them Secrets would never do,) they are for
the most part composed of so many circumstances, or superfluous
ingredients, that it would be very hard for him to decypher the truth of
them: Besides, he would find them all so ill exprest, or else so false,
by reason that those who made them have laboured to make them appear
conformable to their principles; that if there were any which served
their turn, they could not at least be worth the while which must be
imployed in the choice of them.So that, if there were any in the world
that were certainly known to be capable of finding out the greatest
things, and the most profitable for the Publick which could be, and that
other men would therefore labour alwayes to assist him to accomplish his
Designes; I do not conceive that they could do more for him, then
furnish the expence of the experiments whereof he stood in need; and
besides, take care only that he may not be by any body hindred of his
time.But besides that, I do not presume so much of my Self, as to
promise any thing extraordinary, neither do I feed my self with such
vain hopes, as to imagine that the Publick should much interesse it self
in my designes; I have not so base a minde, as to accept of any favour
whatsoever, which might be thought I had not deserved.All these considerations joyned together, were the cause three years
since why I would not divulge the Treatise I had in hand; and which is
more, that I resolved to publish none whilest I lived, which might be so
general, as that the Grounds of my Philosophy might be understood
thereby.But since, there hath been two other reasons have obliged me to
put forth some particular Essays, and to give the Publick some account
of my Actions and Designes.The first was, that if I failed therein,
divers who knew the intention I formerly had to print some of my
Writings, might imagine that the causes for which I forbore it, might
be more to my disadvantage then they are.For although I do not affect
glory in excess; or even, (if I may so speak) that I hate it, as far as
I judge it contrary to my rest, which I esteem above all things: Yet
also did I never seek to hide my actions as crimes, neither have I been
very wary to keep my self unknown; as well because I thought I might
wrong my self, as that it might in some manner disquiet me, which would
again have been contrary to the perfect repose of my minde which I seek.And because having alwayes kept my self indifferent, caring not whether
I were known or no, I could not chuse but get some kinde of reputation,
I thought that I ought to do my best to hinder it at least from being
ill.The other reason which obliged me to write this, is, that observing
every day more and more the designe I have to instruct my self, retarded
by reason of an infinite number of experiments which are needful to me,
and which its impossible for me to make without the help of others;
although I do not so much flatter my self, as to hope that the Publick,
shares much in my concernments; yet will I not also be so much wanting
to my self, as to give any cause to those who shall survive me, to
reproach this, one day to me, That I could have left them divers things
far beyond what I have done, had I not too much neglected to make them
understand wherein they might contribute to my designe.And I thought it easie for me to choose some matters, which being not
subject to many Controversies, nor obliging me to declare any more of my
Principles then I would willingly, would neverthelesse expresse clearly
enough, what my abilities or defects are in the Sciences.Wherein I
cannot say whether I have succeeded or no; neither will I prevent the
judgment of any man by speaking of my own Writings: but I should be
glad they might be examin'd; and to that end I beseech all those who
have any objections to make, to take the pains to send them to my
Stationer, that I being advertised by him, may endeavour at the same
time to adjoyn my Answer thereunto: and by that means, the Reader seeing
both the one and the other, may the more easily judge of the Truth.For
I promise, that I will never make any long Answers, but only very freely
confesse my own faults, if I find them; or if I cannot discover them,
plainly say what I shal think requisite in defence of what I have writ,
without adding the explanation of any new matter, that I may not
endlesly engage my self out of one into another.Now if there be any whereof I have spoken in the beginning, of the
Opticks and of the Meteors, which at first jarr, by reason that I call
them Suppositions, and that I seem not willing to prove them; let a man
have but the patience to read the whole attentively, and I hope he will
rest satisfied: For (me thinks) the reasons follow each other so
closely, that as the later are demonstrated by the former, which are
their Causes; the former are reciprocally proved by the later, which are
their Effects.And no man can imagine that I herein commit the fault
which the Logicians call a _Circle_; for experience rendring the
greatest part of these effects most certain, the causes whence I deduce
them serve not so much to prove, as to explain them; but on the
contrary, they are those which are proved by them.Neither named I them
Suppositions, that it might be known that I conceive my self able to
deduce them from those first Truths which I have before discovered: But
that I would not expresly do it to crosse certain spirits, who imagine
that they know in a day al what another may have thought in twenty
yeers, as soon as he hath told them but two or three words; and who are
so much the more subject to erre, and less capable of the Truth, (as
they are more quick and penetrating) from taking occasion of erecting
some extravagant Philosophy on what they may beleeve to be my
Principles, and lest the fault should be attributed to me.For as for
those opinions which are wholly mine, I excuse them not as being new,
because that if the reasons of them be seriously considered, I assure my
self, they will be found so plain, and so agreeable to common sense,
that they will seem less extraordinary and strange then any other which
may be held on the same Subjects.Neither do I boast that I am the first
Inventor of any of them; but of this indeed, that I never admitted any
of them, neither because they had, or had not been said by others, but
only because Reason perswaded me to them.If Mechanicks cannot so soon put in practise the Invention which is set
forth in the Opticks, I beleeve that therefore men ought not to condemn
it; forasmuch as skill and practice are necessary for the making and
compleating the Machines I have described; so that no circumstance
should be wanting.I should no less wonder if they should succeed at
first triall, then if a man should learn in a day to play excellently
well on a Lute, by having an exact piece set before him.And if I write
in French, which is the language of my Country, rather then in Latin,
which is that of my Tutors, 'tis because I hope such who use their meer
naturall reason, wil better judge of my opinions, then those who only
beleeve in old Books.And for those who joyn a right understanding with
study, (who I only wish for my Judges) I assure my self, they will not
be so partiall to the Latin, as to refuse to read my reasons because I
expresse them in a vulgar tongue.To conclude, I will not speak here in particular of the progresse I
hoped to make hereafter in Learning; Nor engage my self by any promise
to the Publick, which I am not certain to perform.But I shall onely
say, That I am resolved to employ the remainder of my life in no other
thing but the study to acquire some such knowledge of Nature as may
furnish us with more certain rules in Physick then we hitherto have had:
And that my inclination drives me so strongly from all other kind of
designes, chiefly from those which cannot be profitable to any, but by
prejudicing others; that if any occasion obliged me to spend my time
therein, I should beleeve I should never succeed therein: which I here
declare, though I well know it conduceth not to make me considerable in
the world; neither is it my ambition to be so.And I shall esteem my
self always more obliged to those by whose favour I shal without
disturbance enjoy my ease, then to them who should proffer me the most
honourable imployment of the earth.+--------------------------------------------------------------+

braines to save mine," is inconsistent with the preceding portion of the
paragraph which speaks of "the exceeding great courtesie" of Powhatan;
and Smith was quite capable of inserting it afterwards when he made up
his

"General Historie."Smith represents himself at this time--the last half of 1616 and the
first three months of 1617--as preparing to attempt a third voyage to
New England (which he did not make), and too busy to do Pocahontas the
service she desired.She was staying at Branford, either from neglect
of the company or because the London smoke disagreed with her, and there
Smith went to see her.His account of his intercourse with her, the only
one we have, must be given for what it is worth.According to this she
had supposed Smith dead, and took umbrage at his neglect of her.He
writes:

"After a modest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured
her face, as not seeming well contented; and in that humour, her husband
with divers others, we all left her two or three hours repenting myself
to have writ she could speak English.But not long after she began to
talke, remembering me well what courtesies she had done: saying, 'You
did promise Powhatan what was yours should be his, and he the like to
you; you called him father, being in his land a stranger, and by the
same reason so must I do you:' which though I would have excused, I
durst not allow of that title, because she was a king's daughter.With
a well set countenance she said: 'Were you not afraid to come into my
father's country and cause fear in him and all his people (but me), and
fear you have I should call you father; I tell you then I will, and
you shall call me childe, and so I will be forever and ever, your
contrieman.They did tell me alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other
till I came to Plymouth, yet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seek
you, and know the truth, because your countriemen will lie much."'This savage was the Tomocomo spoken of above, who had been sent by
Powhatan to take a census of the people of England, and report what they
and their state were.At Plymouth he got a long stick and began to make
notches in it for the people he saw.But he was quickly weary of that
task.He told Smith that Powhatan bade him seek him out, and get him
to show him his God, and the King, Queen, and Prince, of whom Smith had
told so much.Smith put him off about showing his God, but said he had
heard that he had seen the King.This the Indian denied, James probably
not coming up to his idea of a king, till by circumstances he was
convinced he had seen him.Then he replied very sadly: "You gave
Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your king gave
me nothing, and I am better than your white dog."Smith adds that he took several courtiers to see Pocahontas, and "they
did think God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have seen
many English ladies worse favoured, proportioned, and behavioured;" and
he heard that it had pleased the King and Queen greatly to esteem her,
as also Lord and Lady Delaware, and other persons of good quality, both
at the masques and otherwise.Much has been said about the reception of Pocahontas in London, but
the contemporary notices of her are scant.The Indians were objects of
curiosity for a time in London, as odd Americans have often been since,
and the rank of Pocahontas procured her special attention.At the playing of Ben Jonson's "Christmas his Mask" at court, January
6, 1616-17, Pocahontas and Tomocomo were both present, and Chamberlain
writes to Carleton: "The Virginian woman Pocahuntas with her father
counsellor have been with the King and graciously used, and both she and
her assistant were pleased at the Masque.She is upon her return though
sore against her will, if the wind would about to send her away."Neill says that "after the first weeks of her residence in England
she does not appear to be spoken of as the wife of Rolfe by the letter
writers," and the Rev.Peter Fontaine says that "when they heard that
Rolfe had married Pocahontas, it was deliberated in council whether he
had not committed high treason by so doing, that is marrying an Indian
princesse."His interest in the colony was never
the most intelligent, and apt to be in things trivial.15, 1609) writes to Lord Salisbury that he had told the King of
the Virginia squirrels brought into England, which are said to fly.The
King very earnestly asked if none were provided for him, and said he was
sure Salisbury would get him one.Would not have troubled him, "but that
you know so well how he is affected to these toys."There has been recently found in the British Museum a print of a
portrait of Pocahontas, with a legend round it in Latin, which is
translated: "Matoaka, alias Rebecka, Daughter of Prince Powhatan,
Emperor of Virginia; converted to Christianity, married Mr.Rolff; died
on shipboard at Gravesend 1617."This is doubtless the portrait engraved
by Simon De Passe in 1616, and now inserted in the extant copies of the
London edition of the "General Historie," 1624.It is not probable that
the portrait was originally published with the "General Historie."The
portrait inserted in the edition of 1624 has this inscription:

Round the portrait:

"Matoaka als Rebecca Filia Potentiss Princ: Pohatani Imp: Virginim."In the oval, under the portrait:

         "Aetatis suae 21 A.1616"
Below:

"Matoaks als Rebecka daughter to the mighty Prince Powhatan Emprour of
Attanoughkomouck als virginia converted and baptized in the Christian
faith, and wife to the worth Mr.Camden in his "History of Gravesend" says that everybody paid this
young lady all imaginable respect, and it was believed she would have
sufficiently acknowledged those favors, had she lived to return to her
own country, by bringing the Indians to a kinder disposition toward the
English; and that she died, "giving testimony all the time she lay sick,
of her being a very good Christian."The Lady Rebecka, as she was called in London, died on shipboard at
Gravesend after a brief illness, said to be of only three days, probably
on the 21st of March, 1617.I have seen somewhere a statement, which
I cannot confirm, that her disease was smallpox.George's Church,
where she was buried, was destroyed by fire in 1727.The register of
that church has this record:


       "1616, May 21 Rebecca Wrothe
        Wyff of Thomas Wroth gent
     A Virginia lady borne, here was buried
          in ye chaunncle."Yet there is no doubt, according to a record in the Calendar of State
Papers, dated "1617, 29 March, London," that her death occurred March
21, 1617.John Rolfe was made Secretary of Virginia when Captain Argall became
Governor, and seems to have been associated in the schemes of that
unscrupulous person and to have forfeited the good opinion of the
company.August 23, 1618, the company wrote to Argall: "We cannot
imagine why you should give us warning that Opechankano and the natives
have given the country to Mr.Rolfe's child, and that they reserve it
from all others till he comes of years except as we suppose as some
do here report it be a device of your own, to some special purpose for
yourself."It appears also by the minutes of the company in 1621 that
Lady Delaware had trouble to recover goods of hers left in Rolfe's hands
in Virginia, and desired a commission directed to Sir Thomas Wyatt and
Mr.George Sandys to examine what goods of the late "Lord Deleware had
come into Rolfe's possession and get satisfaction of him."This George
Sandys is the famous traveler who made a journey through the Turkish
Empire in 1610, and who wrote, while living in Virginia, the first book
written in the New World, the completion of his translation of Ovid's
"Metamorphosis."John Rolfe died in Virginia in 1622, leaving a wife and children.This is supposed to be his third wife, though there is no note of his
marriage to her nor of the death of his first.October 7, 1622, his
brother Henry Rolfe petitioned that the estate of John should be
converted to the support of his relict wife and children and to his own
indemnity for having brought up John's child by Powhatan's daughter.This child, named Thomas Rolfe, was given after the death of Pocahontas
to the keeping of Sir Lewis Stukely of Plymouth, who fell into evil
practices, and the boy was transferred to the guardianship of his uncle
Henry Rolfe, and educated in London.When he was grown up he returned
to Virginia, and was probably there married.There is on record his
application to the Virginia authorities in 1641 for leave to go into the
Indian country and visit Cleopatra, his mother's sister.He left an only
daughter who was married, says Stith (1753), "to Col.John Bolling; by
whom she left an only son, the late Major John Bolling, who was father
to the present Col.John Bolling, and several daughters, married to
Col.Campbell in his "History of Virginia"
says that the first Randolph that came to the James River was an
esteemed and industrious mechanic, and that one of his sons, Richard,
grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph, married Jane Bolling, the
great granddaughter of Pocahontas.In 1618 died the great Powhatan, full of years and satiated with
fighting and the savage delights of life.He had many names and titles;
his own people sometimes called him Ottaniack, sometimes Mamauatonick,
and usually in his presence Wahunsenasawk.He ruled, by inheritance and
conquest, with many chiefs under him, over a large territory with not
defined borders, lying on the James, the York, the Rappahannock, the
Potomac, and the Pawtuxet Rivers.He had several seats, at which he
alternately lived with his many wives and guard of bowmen, the chief of
which at the arrival of the English was Werowomocomo, on the Pamunkey
(York) River.He is said
to have had a hundred wives, and generally a dozen--the
youngest--personally attending him.When he had a mind to add to his
harem he seems to have had the ancient oriental custom of sending into
all his dominions for the fairest maidens to be brought from whom to
select.And he gave the wives of whom he was tired to his favorites.Strachey makes a striking description of him as he appeared about 1610:
"He is a goodly old man not yet shrincking, though well beaten with cold
and stormeye winters, in which he hath been patient of many necessityes
and attempts of his fortune to make his name and famely great.He is
supposed to be little lesse than eighty yeares old, I dare not saye how
much more; others saye he is of a tall stature and cleane lymbes, of a
sad aspect, rownd fatt visaged, with graie haires, but plaine and thin,
hanging upon his broad showlders; some few haires upon his chin, and so
on his upper lippe: he hath been a strong and able salvadge, synowye,
vigilant, ambitious, subtile to enlarge his dominions:... cruell he hath
been, and quarellous as well with his own wcrowanccs for trifles, and
that to strike a terrour and awe into them of his power and condicion,
as also with his neighbors in his younger days, though now delighted in
security and pleasure, and therefore stands upon reasonable conditions
of peace with all the great and absolute werowances about him, and is
likewise more quietly settled amongst his own."It was at this advanced age that he had the twelve favorite young wives
whom Strachey names.All his people obeyed him with fear and adoration,
presenting anything he ordered at his feet, and trembling if he frowned.His punishments were cruel; offenders were beaten to death before him,
or tied to trees and dismembered joint by joint, or broiled to death on
burning coals.Strachey wondered how such a barbarous prince should put
on such ostentation of majesty, yet he accounted for it as belonging to
the necessary divinity that doth hedge in a king: "Such is (I believe)
the impression of the divine nature, and however these (as other
heathens forsaken by the true light) have not that porcion of the
knowing blessed Christian spiritt, yet I am perswaded there is an
infused kind of divinities and extraordinary (appointed that it shall
be so by the King of kings) to such as are his ymedyate instruments on
earth."Here is perhaps as good a place as any to say a word or two about the
appearance and habits of Powhatan's subjects, as they were observed
by Strachey and Smith.A sort of religion they had, with priests or
conjurors, and houses set apart as temples, wherein images were kept
and conjurations performed, but the ceremonies seem not worship, but
propitiations against evil, and there seems to have been no conception
of an overruling power or of an immortal life.Smith describes a
ceremony of sacrifice of children to their deity; but this is doubtful,
although Parson Whittaker, who calls the Indians "naked slaves of the
devil," also says they sacrificed sometimes themselves and sometimes
their own children.An image of their god which he sent to England
"was painted upon one side of a toadstool, much like unto a deformed
monster."And he adds: "Their priests, whom they call Quockosoughs, are
no other but such as our English witches are."This notion I believe
also pertained among the New England colonists.There was a belief
that the Indian conjurors had some power over the elements, but not a
well-regulated power, and in time the Indians came to a belief in the
better effect of the invocations of the whites.In "Winslow's Relation,"
quoted by Alexander Young in his "Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
under date of July, 1623, we read that on account of a great drought
a fast day was appointed.The
exercise lasted eight or nine hours.Before they broke up, owing to
prayers the weather was overcast.This the Indians seeing, admired the goodness of our God: "showing the
difference between their conjuration and our invocation in the name
of God for rain; theirs being mixed with such storms and tempests, as
sometimes, instead of doing them good, it layeth the corn flat on the
ground; but ours in so gentle and seasonable a manner, as they never
observed the like."It was a common opinion of the early settlers in Virginia, as it was of
those in New England, that the Indians were born white, but that they
got a brown or tawny color by the use of red ointments, made of earth
and the juice of roots, with which they besmear themselves either
according to the custom of the country or as a defense against the
stinging of mosquitoes.The women are of the same hue as the men, says
Strachey; "howbeit, it is supposed neither of them naturally borne so
discolored; for Captain Smith (lyving sometymes amongst them) affirmeth
how they are from the womb indifferent white, but as the men, so doe the
women," "dye and disguise themselves into this tawny cowler, esteeming
it the best beauty to be nearest such a kind of murrey as a sodden
quince is of," as the Greek women colored their faces and the ancient
Britain women dyed themselves with red; "howbeit [Strachey slyly adds]
he or she that hath obtained the perfected art in the tempering of this
collour with any better kind of earth, yearb or root preserves it not
yet so secrett and precious unto herself as doe our great ladyes their
oyle of talchum, or other painting white and red, but they frindly
communicate the secret and teach it one another."Thomas Lechford in his "Plain Dealing; or Newes from New England,"
London, 1642, says: "They are of complexion swarthy and tawny; their
children are borne white, but they bedawbe them with oyle and colors
presently."The men are described as tall, straight, and of comely proportions; no
beards; hair black, coarse, and thick; noses broad, flat, and full at
the end; with big lips and wide mouths', yet nothing so unsightly as
the Moors; and the women as having "handsome limbs, slender arms, pretty
hands, and when they sing they have a pleasant tange in their voices.The men shaved their hair on the right side, the women acting as
barbers, and left the hair full length on the left side, with a lock an
ell long."A Puritan divine--"New England's Plantation, 1630"--says of
the Indians about him, "their hair is generally black, and cut before
like our gentlewomen, and one lock longer than the rest, much like to
our gentlemen, which fashion I think came from hence into England."Their love of ornaments is sufficiently illustrated by an extract from
Strachey, which is in substance what Smith writes:

"Their eares they boare with wyde holes, commonly two or three, and in
the same they doe hang chaines of stayned pearle braceletts, of white
bone or shreeds of copper, beaten thinne and bright, and wounde up
hollowe, and with a grate pride, certaine fowles' legges, eagles,
hawkes, turkeys, etc., with beasts clawes, bears, arrahacounes,
squirrells, etc.The clawes thrust through they let hang upon the cheeke
to the full view, and some of their men there be who will weare in these
holes a small greene and yellow-couloured live snake, neere half a yard
in length, which crawling and lapping himself about his neck oftentymes
familiarly, he suffreeth to kisse his lippes.Others weare a dead ratt
tyed by the tayle, and such like conundrums."This is the earliest use I find of our word "conundrum," and the sense
it bears here may aid in discovering its origin.Powhatan is a very large figure in early Virginia history, and deserves
his prominence.He was an able and crafty savage, and made a good fight
against the encroachments of the whites, but he was no match for
the crafty Smith, nor the double-dealing of the Christians.There is
something pathetic about the close of his life, his sorrow for the death
of his daughter in a strange land, when he saw his territories overrun
by the invaders, from whom he only asked peace, and the poor privilege
of moving further away from them into the wilderness if they denied him
peace.In the midst of this savagery Pocahontas blooms like a sweet, wild rose.She was, like the Douglas, "tender and true."Wanting apparently the
cruel nature of her race generally, her heroic qualities were all of the
heart.No one of all the contemporary writers has anything but gentle
words for her.Barbarous and untaught she was like her comrades, but of
a gentle nature.Stripped of all the fictions which Captain Smith has
woven into her story, and all the romantic suggestions which later
writers have indulged in, she appears, in the light of the few facts
that industry is able to gather concerning her, as a pleasing and
unrestrained Indian girl, probably not different from her savage sisters
in her habits, but bright and gentle; struck with admiration at the
appearance of the white men, and easily moved to pity them, and so
inclined to a growing and lasting friendship for them; tractable and apt
to learn refinements; accepting the new religion through love for those
who taught it, and finally becoming in her maturity a well-balanced,
sensible, dignified Christian woman.According to the long-accepted story of Pocahontas, she did something
more than interfere to save from barbarous torture and death a stranger
and a captive, who had forfeited his life by shooting those who
opposed his invasion.In all times, among the most savage tribes and in
civilized society, women have been moved to heavenly pity by the sight
of a prisoner, and risked life to save him--the impulse was as natural
to a Highland lass as to an African maid.Pocahontas went further than
efforts to make peace between the superior race and her own.When the
whites forced the Indians to contribute from their scanty stores to the
support of the invaders, and burned their dwellings and shot them on
sight if they refused, the Indian maid sympathized with the exposed
whites and warned them of stratagems against them; captured herself by a
base violation of the laws of hospitality, she was easily reconciled to
her situation, adopted the habits of the foreigners, married one of her
captors, and in peace and in war cast in her lot with the strangers.History has not preserved for us the Indian view of her conduct.It was no doubt fortunate for her, though perhaps not for the colony,
that her romantic career ended by an early death, so that she always
remains in history in the bloom of youth.She did not live to be pained
by the contrast, to which her eyes were opened, between her own and her
adopted people, nor to learn what things could be done in the Christian
name she loved, nor to see her husband in a less honorable light than
she left him, nor to be involved in any way in the frightful massacre
of 1622.If she had remained in England after the novelty was over, she
might have been subject to slights and mortifying neglect.The struggles
of the fighting colony could have brought her little but pain.Dying
when she did, she rounded out one of the prettiest romances of all
history, and secured for her name the affection of a great nation, whose
empire has spared little that belonged to her childhood and race, except
the remembrance of her friendship for those who destroyed her people.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

112   pet monkey."The difficulty in applying ornaments borrowed from other styles is, that
although they all suggest construction, it is not _the_ construction of
the buildings to which they are applied.To use Pugin’s clever
antithesis, “they are constructed ornament, not ornamented
construction,” and as such can never satisfy the mind.However beautiful
in themselves, they are out of place, there is no real or apparent use
for their being there; and, in an art so essentially founded on
utilitarian principles and common sense as architecture is, any offence
against constructive propriety is utterly intolerable.The other class, or decorative ornaments, are forms invented for the
purpose, either mere lithic forms, or copied from the vegetable kingdom,
and applied so as to give elegance or brilliancy to the constructive
decoration just described.The first and most obvious of these are mere mouldings, known to
architects as Scotias, Cavettos, Ogees, Toruses, Rolls, &c.—curves
which, used in various proportions either horizontally or vertically,
produce when artistically combined, the most pleasing effect.In conjunction with these, it is usual to employ a purely conventional
class of ornament, such as frets, scrolls, or those known as the bead
and reel, or egg and dart mouldings; or in Gothic architecture the
billet or dog-tooth or all the thousand and one forms that were invented
during the Middle Ages.In certain styles of art, vegetable forms are employed even more
frequently than those last described.Among these, perhaps the most
beautiful and perfect ever invented was that known as the honeysuckle
ornament, which the Greeks borrowed from the Assyrians, but made so
peculiarly their own.It has all the conventional character of a purely
lithic, with all the grace of a vegetable form; and, as used with the
Ionic order, is more nearly perfect than any other known.The Romans made a step further towards a more direct imitation of nature
in their employment of the acanthus leaf.As applied to a capital, or
where the constructive form of the bell beneath it is still distinctly
seen, it is not only unobjectionable, but productive of the most
pleasing effect.Indeed it is doubtful if anything of its class has yet
been invented so entirely satisfactory as the Roman Corinthian order, as
found, for instance, in the so-called Temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome.The proportions of the order have never yet been excelled, and there is
just that balance between imitation of nature and conventionality which
is indispensable.It is not so pure or perfect as a Grecian order, but
as an example of rich decoration applied to an architectural order it is
unsurpassed.With their disregard of precedent and untrammelled wildness of
imagination, the Gothic architects tried every form of vegetable
ornament, from the purest conventionalism, where the vegetable form can
hardly be recognised, to the most literal imitation of nature.While confining himself to purely lithic forms, an architect can never
sin against good taste, though he may miss many beauties; with the
latter class of ornament he is always in danger of offence, and few have
ever employed it without falling into mistakes.In the first place,
because it is impossible to imitate perfectly foliage and flowers in
stone; and secondly, because if the pliant forms of plants are made to
support, or do the work of, hard stone, the incongruity is immediately
apparent, and the more perfect the imitation the greater the mistake.5), any amount of literal imitation that
the sculptor thought proper may be indulged in, because in it the stone
construction is so apparent everywhere, that the vegetable form is the
merest supplement conceivable; or in a hollow moulding round a doorway,
a vine may be sculptured with any degree of imitation that can be
employed; for as it has no more work to do than the object represented
would have in the same situation, it is a mere adjunct, a statue of a
plant placed in a niche, as we might use the statue of a man: but if in
the woodcut (No.6) imitations of real leaves were used to support the
upper moulding, the effect would not be so satisfactory; indeed it is
questionable if in both these last examples a little more
conventionality would not be desirable.In too many instances, even in the best Gothic architecture, the
construction is so overlaid by imitative vegetable forms as to be
concealed, and the work is apparently done by leaves or twigs, but in
the earliest and purest style this is almost never the case.As a
general rule it may be asserted that the best lithic ornaments are those
which approach nearest to the grace and pliancy of plants, and that the
best vegetable forms are those which most resemble the regularity and
symmetry of such as are purely conventional.Although the Greeks in one or two instances employed human figures to
support entablatures or beams, the good taste of such an arrangement is
more than questionable.They borrowed it, with the Ionic order, from the
Assyrians, with whom the employment of caryatides and animal forms was
the rule, not the exception, in contradistinction from the Egyptians,
who never adopted this practice.[14] Even the Romans avoided this
mistake, and the Gothic architects also as a general rule kept quite
clear of it.Whenever they did employ ornamented figures for
architectural purposes, they were either monsters, as in gargoyles or
griffons; or sometimes, in a spirit of caricature, they used dwarfs or
deformities of various sorts; but their sculpture, properly so called,
was always provided with a niche or pedestal, where it might have been
placed after the building was complete, or from which it might be
removed without interfering with the architecture.Colour is one of the most invaluable elements placed at the command of
the architect to enable him to give grace or finish to his designs.From
its nature it is of course only an accessory, or mere ornament; but
there is nothing that enables him to express his meaning so cheaply and
easily, and at the same time with such brilliancy and effect.For an
interior it is absolutely indispensable; and no apartment can be said to
be complete till it has received its finishing touches from the hand of
the painter.Whether exteriors ought or ought not to be similarly
treated admits of more doubt.Internally the architect has complete command of the situation: he can
suit his design to his colours, or his colours to his design.Walls,
roof, floor, furniture, are all at his disposal, and he can shut out any
discordant element that would interfere with the desired effect.Externally this is seldom, if ever the case.A façade that looks
brilliant and well in noonday sun may be utterly out of harmony with a
cold grey sky, or with the warm glow of a setting sun full upon it: and
unless all other buildings and objects are toned into accordance with
it, the effect can seldom be harmonious.There can be now no reasonable doubt that the Greeks painted their
temples both internally and externally, but as a general rule they
always placed them on heights where they could only be seen relieved
against the sky; and they could depend on an atmosphere of almost
uniform, unvarying brightness.Had their temples been placed in groves
or valleys, they would probably have given up the attempt, and certainly
never would have ventured upon it in such a climate as ours.Except in such countries as Egypt and Greece, it must always be a
mistake to apply colour by merely painting the surface of the building
externally; but there are other modes of effecting this which are
perfectly legitimate.ornaments may be inlaid in the stone of
the wall without interfering with the construction, and so placed may be
made more effective and brilliant than the same ornaments would be if
carved in relief.Again, string-courses and mouldings of various
 stones or marbles might frequently be employed with better
effect than can be obtained in some situations by depth of cutting and
boldness of projection.Such a mode of decoration can, however, only be
partial; if the whole building is to be, it must be done
constructively, by using different  materials, or the effect
will never be satisfactory.In the Middle Ages the Italians carried this mode of decoration to a
considerable extent; but in almost all instances it is so evidently a
veneer overlying the construction that it fails to please; and a
decoration which internally, where construction is of less importance,
would excite general admiration, is without meaning on the outside of
the same wall.At the same time it is easy to conceive how polychromy might be carried
out successfully, if, for instance, a building were erected, the pillars
of which were of red granite or porphyry, the cornices or string-courses
of dark  marbles, and the plain surfaces of lighter kinds, or
even of stone.A design so carried out would be infinitely more
effective than a similar one executed in materials of only one colour,
and depending for relief only on varying shadows of daylight.There is
in fact just the same difficulty in lighting monochromatic buildings as
there is with sculpture.A  painting, on the other hand,
requires merely sufficient light, and with that expresses its form and
meaning far more clearly and easily than when only one colour is
employed.The task, however, is difficult; so much so, indeed, that
there is hardly one single instance known of a complete polychromatic
design being successfully carried out anywhere, though often attempted.The other mode of merely inlaying the ornaments in colour instead of
relieving them by carving as seldom fails.Notwithstanding this, an architect should never neglect to select the
colour of his materials with reference to the situation in which his
building is to stand.A red brick building may look remarkably well if
nestling among green trees, while the same building would be hideous if
situated on a sandy plain, and relieved only by the warm glow of a
setting sun.A building of white stone or white brick is as
inappropriate among the trees, and may look bright and cheerful in the
other situation.In towns colours might be used of very great brilliancy, and if done
constructively, there could be no greater improvement to our
architecture; but its application is so difficult that no satisfactory
result has yet been attained, and it may be questioned whether it will
be ever successfully accomplished.With regard to interiors there can be no doubt.All architects in all
countries of the world resorted to this expedient to harmonise and to
give brilliancy to their compositions, and have depended on it for their
most important effects.The Gothic architects carried this a step further by the introduction of
painted glass, which was a mode of colouring more brilliant than had
been ever before attempted.This went beyond all previous efforts,
inasmuch as it  not only the objects themselves, but also the
light in which they were seen.So enamoured were they of its beauties,
that they sacrificed much of the constructive propriety of their
buildings to admit of its display, and paid more attention to it than to
any other part of their designs.Perhaps they carried this predilection
a little beyond the limits of good taste; but colour is in itself so
exquisite a thing, and so admirable a vehicle for the expression of
architectural as well as of æsthetic beauty, that it is difficult to
find fault even with the abuse of what is in its essence so legitimate
and so beautiful.XIII.—SCULPTURE AND PAINTING.Carved ornament and decorative colour come within the especial province
of the architect.In some styles, such as the Saracenic, and in many
buildings, they form the Alpha and the Omega of the decoration.But, as
mentioned above, one of the great merits of architecture as an art is
that it affords room for the display of the works of the sculptor and
the painter, not only in such a manner as not to interfere with its own
decorative construction, but so as to add meaning and value to the
whole.No Greek temple and no Gothic cathedral can indeed be said to be
perfect or complete without these adjuncts; and one of the principal
objects of the architects in Greece or in the Middle Ages was to design
places and devise means by which these could be displayed to advantage,
without interfering either with the construction or constructive
decoration.This was perhaps effected more successfully in the Parthenon
than in any other building we are acquainted with.The pediments at
either end were noble frames for the exhibition of sculpture, and the
metopes were equally appropriate for the purpose; while the plain walls
of the cella were admirably adapted for paintings below and for a
sculptured frieze above.The deeply recessed portals of our Gothic cathedrals, their galleries,
their niches and pinnacles, were equally appropriate for the exuberant
display of this class of sculpture in a less refined or fastidious age;
while the mullion-framed windows were admirably adapted for the
exhibition of a mode of  decoration, somewhat barbarous, it must
be confessed, but wonderfully brilliant.The system was carried further in India than in any other country except
perhaps Egypt.Probably no Hindu temple was ever erected without being
at least intended to be adorned with Phonetic sculpture, and many of
them are covered with it from the plinth to the eaves, in strong
contrast with the Mahomedan buildings that stand side by side with them,
and which are wholly devoid of any attempt at this kind of decoration.The taste of these Hindu sculptures may be questionable, but such as
they are they are so used as never to interfere with the architectural
effect of the building on which they are employed, but always so as to
aid the design irrespective of the story they have to tell.There is
probably no instance in which their removal or their absence would not
be felt as an injury from an architectural point of view.It is difficult now to ascertain whether Phonetic painting was used to
the same extent as sculpture in ancient times.From its nature it is
infinitely more perishable, and a bucket of whitewash will in half an
hour obliterate the work of years, and, strange to say, there are ages,
both in the East and the west, where men’s minds are so attuned that
they consider whitewash a more fitting decoration than 
paintings of the most elaborate and artistic character.While this is so
we need hardly wonder that our means of forming a distinct opinion on
this subject are somewhat limited.Be this as it may, it is still one of the special privileges of
architecture that she is able to attract to herself these phonetic arts,
and one of the greatest merits a building can possess is its affording
appropriate places for their display without interfering in any way with
the special department of the architect.But it is always necessary to
distinguish carefully between what belongs to the province of each art
separately.The work of the architect ought to be complete and perfect
without either sculpture or painting, and must be judged as if they were
absent; but he will not have been entirely successful unless he has
provided the means by which the value of his design may be doubled by
their introduction.It is only by the combination of the Phonetic
utterance with the Technic and Æsthetic elements that a perfect work of
art has been produced, and that architecture can be said to have reached
the highest point of perfection to which it can aspire.Considerable confusion has been introduced into the reasoning on the
subject of architectural Uniformity from the assumption that the two
great schools of art—the classical and the mediæval—adopted contrary
conclusions regarding it, Formality being supposed to be the
characteristic of the former, Irregularity of the latter.The Greeks, of
course, when building a temple or monument, which was only one room or
one object, made it exactly symmetrical in all its parts; but so did the
Gothic architects when building a church or chapel or hall, or any
single object: in ninety-nine instances out of a hundred, a line drawn
down the centre divides it into two equal and symmetrical halves; and
when an exception to this occurs, there is some obvious motive for it.But where several buildings of different classes were to be grouped, or
even two temples placed near one another, the Greeks took the utmost
care to prevent their appearing parts of one design or one whole; and
when, as in the instance of the Erechtheium,[15] three temples are
placed together, no Gothic architect ever took such pains to secure for
each its separate individuality as the Grecian architect did.What has
given rise to the error is, that all the smaller objects of Grecian art
have perished, leaving us only the great monuments without their
adjuncts.If we can conceive the task assigned to a Grecian architect of erecting
a building like one of our collegiate institutions, he would without
doubt have distinguished the chapel from the refectory, and that from
the library, and he would have made them of a totally different design
from the principal’s lodge, or the chambers of the fellows and students;
but it is more than probable that, while carefully distinguishing each
part from the other, he would have arranged them with some regard to
symmetry, placing the chapel in the centre, the library and refectory as
pendants to one another, though dissimilar, and the residences so as to
connect and fill up the whole design.The truth seems to be that no
great amount of dignity can be obtained without a certain degree of
regularity; and there can be little doubt that artistically it is better
that mere utilitarian convenience should give way to the exigencies of
architectural design than that the latter should be constrained to yield
to the mere prosaic requirements of the building.The chance-medley
manner in which many such buildings were grouped together in the Middle
Ages tells the story as clearly, and may be productive of great
picturesqueness of effect, but not of the same nobility as might have
been obtained by more regularity.The highest class of design will never
be reached by these means.It is not difficult to discover, at least to a certain extent, that the
cause of this is that no number of separate units will suffice to make
one whole.A number of pebbles will not make a great stone, nor a number
of rose-bushes an oak; nor will any number of dwarfs make up a giant.To
obtain a great whole there must be unity, to which all the parts must
contribute, or they will remain separate particles.The effect of unity
is materially heightened when to it is added uniformity: the mind then
instantly and easily grasps the whole, knows it to be one, and
recognises the ruling idea that governed and moulded the whole together.It seems only to be by the introduction of uniformity that sufficient
simplicity for greatness can be obtained, and the evidence of design
made so manifest that the mind is satisfied that the building is no mere
accumulation of separate objects, but the production of a master-mind.In a palace irregularity seems unpardonable.The architect has there
practically unlimited command of funds and of his arrangements, and he
can easily design his suites of rooms so as to produce any amount of
uniformity he may require: the different heights of the different
storeys and the amount of ornament on them, with the employment of wings
for offices, is sufficient to mark the various purposes of the various
parts; but where the system is carried so far in great public buildings,
that great halls, libraries, committee-rooms, and subordinate residences
are all squeezed into one perfectly uniform design, the building loses
all meaning, and fails from the opposite error.The rule seems to be, that every building or every part of one ought
most distinctly and clearly to express not only its constructive
exigencies, but also the uses for which it is destined; on the other
hand, that mere utility, in all instances where architectural effect is
aimed at, ought to give way to artistic requirements; and that an
architect is consequently justified, in so far as his means will admit,
in producing that amount of uniformity and regularity which seems
indispensable for anything like grandeur of effect.In villas and small
buildings all we look for is picturesqueness and meaning combined with
elegance; but in larger and more monumental erections we expect
something more; and this can hardly be obtained without the introduction
of some new element which shall tell, in the first place, that artistic
excellence was the ruling idea of the design, and in the next should
give it that perfect balance and symmetry which seems to be as inherent
a quality of the higher works of nature as of true art.XV.—IMITATION OF NATURE.The subject of the imitation of Nature is one intimately connected with
those mooted in the preceding paragraphs, and regarding which
considerable misunderstanding seems to prevail.It is generally assumed
that in architecture we ought to copy natural objects as we see them,
whereas the truth seems to be that we ought always to copy the
processes, never the forms of Nature.The error apparently has arisen
from confounding together the imitative arts of painting and sculpture
with the constructive art of architecture.The former have no other mode
of expression than by copying, more or less literally, the forms of
Nature; the latter, as explained above, depends wholly on a different
class of elements for its effect; but at the same time no architect can
either study too intently, or copy too closely, the methods and
processes by which Nature accomplishes her ends; and the most perfect
building will be that in which these have been most closely and
literally followed.To take one prominent instance:—So far as we can judge, the human body
is the most perfect of Nature’s works; in it the groundwork of skeleton
is never seen, and though it can hardly be said to be anywhere
concealed, it is only displayed at the joints or more prominent points
of support, where the action of the frame would be otherwise
unintelligible.The muscles are disposed not only where they are most
useful, but so as to form groups gracefully rounded in outline.The
softness and elegance of these are further aided by the deposition of
adipose matter, and the whole is covered with a skin which with its
beautiful texture conceals the more utilitarian construction of the
internal parts.In the trunk of the body the viscera are disposed wholly
without symmetry or reference to beauty of any sort—the heart on one
side, the liver on the other, and the other parts exactly in those
positions and in those forms by which they may most directly and easily
perform the essential functions for which they are designed.But the
whole is concealed in a perfectly symmetrical sheath of the most
exquisitely beautiful outline.It may be safely asserted that a building
is beautiful and perfect exactly in the ratio in which the same amount
of concealment and the same amount of display of construction is
preserved, where the same symmetry is shown as between the right and
left sides of the human body—the same difference as between the legs and
arms, where the parts are applied to different purposes, and where the
same amount of ornament is added, to adorn without interfering with what
is useful.In short, there is no principle involved in the structure of
man which may not be taken as the most absolute standard of excellence
in architecture.It is in Nature’s highest works that we find the symmetry of proportion
most prominent.When we descend to the lower types of animals we lose it
to a great extent, and among trees and vegetables generally find it only
in a far less degree, and sometimes miss it altogether.In the mineral
kingdom among rocks and stones it is altogether absent.So universal is
this principle in Nature that we may safely apply it to our criticism on
art, and say that a building is perfect as a whole in proportion to its
motived regularity, and departs from the highest type in the ratio in
which symmetrical arrangement is neglected.It may, however, be
incorrect to say that an oak-tree is a less perfect work of creation
than a human being, but it is certain that it is lower in the scale of
created beings.So it may be said that a picturesque group of Gothic
buildings may be as perfect as the stately regularity of an Egyptian or
classic temple; but if it is so, it is equally certain that it belongs
to a lower and inferior class of design.This analogy, however, we may leave for the present.The one point which
it is indispensable to insist on here is, that man can progress or tend
towards success only by following the principles and copying, so far as
he can understand them, the processes which Nature employs in her works;
but he can never succeed in anything by copying forms without reference
to principles.If we could find Nature making trees like stones, or
animals like trees, or birds like fishes, or fishes like mammalia, or
using any parts taken from one kingdom for purposes belonging to
another, it would then be perfectly legitimate for us to use man’s
stature as the modulus for a Doric, or woman’s as that of an Ionic
column—to build cathedrals like groves, and make windows like leaves, or
to estimate their beauty by their resemblance to such objects; but all
such comparisons proceed on an entire mistake of what imitation of
Nature really means.It is the merest and most absolute negation of reason to apply to one
purpose things that were designed for another, or to imitate them when
they have no appropriateness; but it is our highest privilege to
understand the processes of Nature.To apply these to our own wants and
purposes is the noblest use of human intellect and the perfection of
human wisdom.So instinctively, but so literally, has this correct process of
imitating Nature been followed in all true styles of architecture, that
we can always reason regarding them as we do with reference to natural
objects.Thus, if an architect finds in any quarter of the globe a Doric
or Corinthian capital with a few traces of a foundation, he can, at a
glance, tell the age of the temple or building to which it belonged.He
knows who the people were who erected it, to what purpose it was
dedicated, and proceeds at once to restore its porticos, and without
much uncertainty can reproduce the whole fabric.Or if he finds a few
Gothic bases in situ, with a few mouldings or frusta of columns, by the
same process he traces the age, the size, and the purposes of the
building before him.A Cuvier or an Owen can restore the form and
predicate the habits of an extinct animal from a few fragments of bone,
or even from a print of a foot.In the same manner an architect may,
from a few fragments of a building, if of a true style of architecture,
restore the whole of its pristine forms, and with almost the same amount
of certainty.This arises wholly because the architects of former days
had correct ideas of what was meant by imitation of Nature.They added
nothing to their buildings which was not essential; there was no detail
which had not its use, and no ornament which was not an elaboration or
heightening of some essential part, and hence it is that a true building
is as like to a work of Nature as any production of man’s hands can be
to the creations of his Maker.There is one property inherent in the productions of architectural art,
which, while it frequently lends to them half their charm, at the same
time tends more than anything else to warp and distort our critical
judgments regarding them.We seldom can look at a building of any age
without associating with it such historical memories as may cling to its
walls; and our predilections for any peculiar style of architecture are
more often due to educational or devotional associations than to purely
artistic judgments.A man must be singularly ignorant or strangely
passionless who can stand among the fallen columns of a Grecian temple,
or wander through the corridors of a Roman amphitheatre, or the aisles
of a ruined Gothic abbey, and not feel his heart stirred by emotions of
a totally different class from those suggested by the beauty of the
mouldings or the artistic arrangement of the building he is
contemplating.The enthusiasm which burst forth in the 15th century for the classical
style of art, and then proved fatal to the Gothic, was not so much an
architectural as a literary movement.It arose from the re-discovery—if
it may be so called—of the poems of Homer and Virgil, of the histories
of Thucydides and Tacitus, of the Philosophy of Aristotle and the
eloquence of Cicero.It was a vast reaction against the darkness and
literary degradation of the Middle Ages, and carried the educated
classes of Europe with it for the next three centuries.So long as
classical literature only was taught in our schools, and classical
models followed in our literature, classical architecture could alone be
tolerated in our buildings, and this generally without the least
reference either to its own peculiar beauties, or its appropriateness
for the purposes to which it was applied.A second reaction has now taken place against this state of affairs.The
revival of the rites and ceremonies of the mediæval Church, our reverent
love of our own national antiquities, and our admiration for the rude
but vigorous manhood of the Middle Ages,—all have combined to repress
the classical element both in our literature and our art, and to exalt
in their place Gothic feelings and Gothic art, to an extent which cannot
be justified on any grounds of reasonable criticism.Unless the art-critic can free himself from the influence of these
adventitious associations, his judgments lose half their value; but, on
the other hand, to the historian of art they are of the utmost
importance.It is because architecture so fully and so clearly expresses
the feelings of the people who practised it that it becomes frequently a
better vehicle of history than the written page; and it is these very
associations that give life and meaning to blocks of stone and mounds of
brick, and bring so vividly before our eyes the feelings and the
aspirations of the long-forgotten past.The importance of association in giving value to the objects of
architectural art can hardly be overrated either by the student or
historian.What has to be guarded against is that unreasoning enthusiasm
which mistakes the shadow for the reality, and would force us to admire
a rude piece of clumsy barbarism erected yesterday, and to which no
history consequently attaches, because something like it was done in
some long past age.Its reality, its antiquity, and its weather stains
may render its prototype extremely interesting, even if not beautiful;
while its copy is only an antiquarian toy, as ugly as it is absurd.There is still one other point of view from which it is necessary to
look at this question of architectural design before any just conclusion
can be arrived at regarding it.It is in fact necessary to answer two
other questions, nearly as often asked as those proposed at the
beginning of Section III.“Can any one invent a new style?”—“Can we ever
again have a new and original style of architecture?” Reasoning from
experience alone, it is easy to answer these questions.No individual
has, so far as we know, ever invented a new style in any part of the
world.No one can even be named who during the prevalence of a true
style of art materially advanced its progress, or by his individual
exertion did much to help it forward; and we may safely answer, that as
this has never happened before, it is hardly probable that it will ever
occur now.If this one question must be answered in the negative, the other may as
certainly be answered in the affirmative, inasmuch as no nation in any
age or in any part of the globe has failed to invent for itself a true
and appropriate style of architecture whenever it chose to set about it
in the right way, and there certainly can be no great difficulty in our
doing now what has been so often done before, if we only set to work in
a proper spirit, and are prepared to follow the same process which
others have followed to obtain this result.What that process is, may perhaps be best explained by such an example
as that of ship-building before alluded to, which, though totally
distinct, is still so nearly allied to architecture, as to make a
comparison between the two easy and intelligible.Let us, for instance, take a series of ships, beginning with those in
which William the Conqueror invaded our shores, or the fleet with which
Edward III.Next take the vessels which
transported Henry VIII.to his meeting with Francis I., and then pass on
to the time of the Spanish Armada and the sea fights of Van Tromp and De
Ruyter, and on to the times of William III., and then through the
familiar examples till we come to such ships as the ‘Wellington’ and
‘Marlborough’ of yesterday, and the ‘Warrior’ or ‘Minotaur’ of to-day.In all this long list of examples we have a gradual, steady, forward
progress without one check or break.Each century is in advance of the
one before it, and the result is as near perfection as we can well
conceive.But if we ask who effected these improvements, or who invented any part
of the last-named wonderful fabrics, we must search deep indeed into the
annals of the navy to find out.But no one has inquired and no one cares
to know, for the simple reason that, like architecture in the Middle
Ages, it is a true and living art, and the improvements were not
effected by individuals, but by all classes—owners, sailors,
shipwrights, and men of science, all working together through centuries,
each lending the aid of his experience or of his reasoning.If we place alongside of this series of ships a list of churches or
cathedrals, commencing with Charlemagne and ending with Charles V., we
find the same steady and assured progress obtained by the same identical
means.In this instance, princes, priests, masons, and mathematicians,
all worked steadily together for the whole period, striving to obtain a
well-defined result.In the ship the most suitable materials only are employed in every part,
and neither below nor aloft is there one single timber nor spar nor one
rope which is superfluous.Nor in the cathedral was any material ever
used that was not believed to be the most suitable for its purpose; nor
any form of construction adopted which did not seem the best to those
who employed it; nor any detail added which did not appear necessary for
the purpose it was designed to express?the result being, that we can
look on and contemplate both with the same unmitigated satisfaction.The one point where this comparison seems to halt is, that ship-building
never became a purely fine art, which architecture really is.The
difference is only one of aim, which it would be as easy to apply to the
one art as it has been to the other.Had architecture never progressed
beyond its one strictly legitimate object of house-building, it would
never have been more near a fine art than merchant ship-building, and
palaces would only have been magnified dwelling-places.Castles and
men-of-war advanced both one stage further towards a fine art.Size and
power were impressed on both, and in this respect they stand precisely
equal to one another.Here ship-building halted, and has not progressed
beyond, while architecture has been invested with a higher aim.In all
ages men have sought to erect houses more dignified and stately than
those designed for their personal use.They attempted the erection of
dwelling-places for their Gods, or temples worthy of the worship of
Supreme Beings; and it was only when this strictly useful art threw
aside all shadow of utilitarianism, and launched boldly forth in search
of the beautiful and the sublime, that it became a truly fine art, and
took the elevated position which it now holds above all other useful
arts.It would have been easy to supply the same motive to
ship-building.If we could imagine any nation ever to construct ships of
God, or to worship on the bosom of the ocean, ships might easily be made
such objects of beauty that the cathedral could hardly compete with
them.It is not, however, only in architecture or in ship-building that this
progress is essential, for the progress of every art and every science
that is worthy of the name is owing to the same simple process of the
aggregation of experiences; whether we look to metallurgy or mechanics,
cotton-spinning or coining, their perfection is due to the same cause.So also the sciences—astronomy, chemistry, geology—are all cultivated by
the same means.When the art or science is new, great men stand forth
and make great strides; but when once it reaches maturity, and becomes
the property of the nation, the individual is lost in the mass, and a
thousand inferior brains follow out steadily and surely the path which
the one great intellect has pointed out, but which no single mind,
however great, could carry to its legitimate conclusion.So far as any reason or experience yet known can be applied to this
subject, it seems clear that no art or science ever has been or can be
now advanced by going backwards, and copying earlier forms, or those
applicable to other times or other circumstances; and that progress
towards perfection can only be obtained by the united efforts of many
steadily pursuing a well-defined object.Whenever this is done, success
appears to be inevitable, or at all events every age is perfectly
satisfied with its own productions.Where forward progress is the law,
it is certain that the next age will surpass the present; but the living
cannot conceive anything more perfect than what they are doing, or they
would apply it.Everything in any true art is thoroughly up to the
highest standard of its period, and instead of the dissatisfied
uncertainty in which we are wandering in all matters concerning
architecture, we should be exulting in our own productions, and proud in
leaving to our posterity the progress we have made, feeling assured that
we have paved the way for them to advance to a still higher standard of
perfection.As soon as the public are aware of the importance of this rule, and of
its applicability to architecture, a new style must be the inevitable
result; and if our civilisation is what we believe it to be, that style
will not only be perfectly suited to all our wants and desires, but also
more beautiful and more perfect than any that has ever existed before.If we turn from these speculations to ask what prospect there is of the
public appreciating correctly this view of the matter, or setting
earnestly about carrying it out, the answer can hardly be deemed
satisfactory; in fact, if it were left to the public, very little
progress, except from an utilitarian point of view, would probably be
made.The study of the classical languages, to which so much importance is
attached in our public schools, and in our own and most foreign
universities, tended at one time in another way to draw attention from
the formation of a true style of architecture by fixing it exclusively
on Greek and Roman models.The Renaissance in the 15th century, as
pointed out above, arose much more from admiration of classic literature
than from any feeling for the remains of buildings which had been
neglected for centuries, and were far surpassed by those which succeeded
them.The same feelings perpetuated by early association are the great
cause of the hold that classic art still has on the educated classes in
Europe.On the other hand, the revival of the Gothic style fifty years ago
enlisted the sympathy of the clergy, not only in England, but on the
continent of Europe, when they arrived at the conclusion that the Gothic
style was the one most suited for church-building purposes; and
attempted to establish a point that no deviation from Gothic models
should be tolerated.Beyond these there was another class of men who had but little sympathy
with Greece or Rome, and still less with mediæval monasticism or
feudalism, but who in their own strong sense were inclined to take a
more reasonable view of the matter, and these men have for years been
erecting in London, Manchester, Leeds, and in other cities of England a
series of warehouses and other buildings designed wholly with reference
to their uses, and ornamented only in their construction, and which
consequently are—as far as their utilitarian purposes will allow—as
satisfactory as anything of former days.In addition to these, and within the last fifteen to twenty years, a
very great progress has taken place in domestic architecture, not only
in London and its suburbs, but throughout England, where buildings have
been erected of a new and an original type, peculiarly applicable to the
requirements of English domestic life, and of great variety and
picturesque design; and these remarks apply not only to mansions, but to
the residences of a much humbler and more simple kind.In civil engineering, the lowest and most prosaic branch of
architectural art, our progress has been brilliant and rapid.Of this no
better example can be given than the four great bridges erected over the
Thames.The old bridges of Westminster and Blackfriars, and those of
Waterloo and London, were erected at nearly equal intervals during one
century, and the steady progress which they exhibit is greater than that
of almost any similar branch of art during any equal period of time.In this department our progress is so undeniable that we saw old London
Bridge removed without regret, though it was a work of the same age and
of the same men who built all our greatest and best cathedrals, and in
its own line was quite as perfect and as beautiful as they.But it had
outlived its age, and we knew we could replace it by a better—so its
destruction was inevitable; and if we had made the same progress in the
higher that we have in the lower branches of the building art, we should
see a Gothic cathedral pulled down with the same indifference, content
to know that we could easily replace it by one far nobler and more
worthy of our age and intelligence.No architect during the Middle Ages
ever hesitated to pull down any part of a cathedral that was old and
going to decay, and to replace it with something in the style of the
day, however incongruous that might be; and if we were progressing as
they were, we should have as little compunction in following the same
course.In the confusion of ideas and of styles which now prevails, it is
satisfactory to be able to contemplate, in the Crystal Palace at
Sydenham, at least one great building carried out wholly on the
principles of Gothic or of any true style of art.No material is used in
it which is not the best for its purpose, no constructive expedient
employed which was not absolutely essential, and it depends wholly for
its effect on the arrangement of its parts and the display of its
construction.So essentially is its principle the same which, as we have
seen, animated Gothic architecture, that we hardly know even now how
much of the design belongs to Sir Joseph Paxton, how much to the
contractors, or how much to the subordinate officers employed by the
Company.Here, as in a cathedral, every man was set to work in that
department which it was supposed he was best qualified to superintend.There was room for every art and for every intellect, and clashing and
interference were impossible.This, however, was only the second of the
series.The third was entrusted to an Engineer officer, who had no
architectural education, and who had never thought twice on the subject
before he was set to carry out his very inchoate design for the 1862
Exhibition.He failed of course, for architecture is not a Phonetic art
depending on inspiration, but a technic art based on experience.As
re-erected on Muswell Hill the building was immensely improved, and far
superior to its predecessor, but was burnt down before the public had
time to realise its form.As being rebuilt, it probably will be still
one step further in advance, and if the series were carried to a
hundred, with more leisure and a higher aim, we might perhaps learn to
despise many things we now so servilely copy, and might create a style
surpassing anything that ever went before.We have certainly more
wealth, more constructive skill, and more knowledge than our
forefathers; and, living in the same climate and being of the same race,
there seems no insuperable difficulty in our doing at least as much if
not more than they accomplished.Art, however, will not be regenerated by buildings so ephemeral as
Crystal Palaces or so prosaic as Manchester warehouses, nor by anything
so essentially utilitarian as the works of our engineers.The one hope
is that having commenced at the bottom, the true system may extend
upwards, and come at last to be applied to our palaces and even to
churches, and that the whole nation may lend its aid to work out the
great problem.The prospect of this being done may seem distant, but as
soon as the general significance of the problem is fully appreciated by
the public, the result seems inevitable; and with the means of diffusing
knowledge which we now possess, we may perhaps be permitted to fancy
that the dawn is at hand, and that after our long wanderings in the
dark, daylight may again enlighten our path and gladden our hearts with
the vision of brighter and better things in art than a false system has
hitherto enabled us to attain.These remarks might easily be extended to any desired length, and in
fact this part of the work ought to be enlarged till it equalled the
narrative part, if it had any pretension to be a complete treatise on
the Art of Architecture.In that case, the static or descriptive part of
a treatise on any art is equally important with the dynamic or narrative
part.In most instances more so; but in this respect architecture is
exceptional, and the narrative form is by far the more important of the
two divisions into which the subject naturally divides itself.If, for instance, any one were writing a treatise on Naval Architecture,
it is more than probable that he would not allude to any vessel not
afloat at the time of his writing.If he mentioned the triremes of the
Romans or the galleys of the Venetians, it would be in an introductory
chapter intended for the amusement, not the instruction, of his readers.In like manner, if an engineer undertakes to write on the art of
bridge-building, harbour-making, or on roads or canals, he is only
careful to cite the best existing examples in use, and would be
considered pedantic if he wasted his time, or that of his readers, in
recounting what was done in these departments by the Romans or the
Chinese.If the fine art architecture was with us as well up to the mark
of the intelligence of the day as these more utilitarian branches of the
profession, the same course would be the proper one to pursue in writing
with regard to it.Unfortunately, however, we have no architecture of
our own, and it is impossible to make the various styles in practice
either intelligible or interesting, except by tracing them back to their
origin, and explaining the steps by which they reached perfection.If architecture was practised by us on the same principles that guided
either the Classic or Gothic architects in their designs, a static
treatise on it would not only be the most instructive but the most
pleasing form of teaching its elements.Owing, however, to the system of
copying which is now the basis of all designs, this is no longer the
case, and the consequently abnormal position of the art renders the
study of its principles almost impossible, and memory must supply the
place of pure reason for their elucidation, thus giving to the narrative
branch of the subject a somewhat exaggerated importance, even when
looked at from a merely technic point of view.Besides this, however, the narrative form as applied to Architecture has
advantages of its own greater than those of any other art of the same
class, inasmuch as it is a great stone book in which most of the nations
of the earth have recorded their annals, and written their thoughts, and
even expressed their feelings in clearer and truer language than by any
other form of utterance.The pyramids and temples of Egypt are a truer
expression of the feelings and aspirations of their builders than we can
obtain from any other source.The Parthenon at Athens brings the age of
Pericles more clearly before our eyes in all its perfection of art than
any written page.The Flavian Amphitheatre and the Baths of Caracalla
enable us to realise imperial Rome more vividly than even the glowing
pages of Tacitus.Our Mediæval cathedrals are a living record of the
faith and feelings of peoples, who have left, besides these, but few
materials by which one could judge of their aspirations or of their
civilisation; while, if we wish to know in what India differed from
Europe in those ages, and in what respect she still resembled it, it is
to her contemporary temples that we must turn, and they tell us in a
language not to be mistaken wherein lay the differences, and still how
nearly alike the civilisations at one time were.All this, and
infinitely more, we may learn from a record, which, though often ruined
and nearly obliterated, never deceives.Where it first was placed, there
it still remains to tell to future generations what at that spot, at
some previous time, men thought and felt; what their state of
civilisation enabled them to accomplish, and to what stage they had
attained in their conception of a God.Besides, however, the advantages to be obtained in an artistic point of
view from treating architecture in a narrative rather than in a static
form, there is, as pointed out above, still another, which, though of
minor importance, still adds immensely to the interest of the subject.It is that, when so treated, the art affords one of the clearest and
most certain tests known of the ethnographic relations of people one to
another.It may, therefore, be as well, before proceeding further, to
explain as briefly as is consistent with intelligibility what is meant
by Architectural Ethnography.I.—ETHNOGRAPHY AS APPLIED TO ARCHITECTURAL ART.Ethnology, though one of the youngest, is perhaps neither the least
beautiful nor the least attractive of that fair sisterhood of sciences
whose birth has rewarded the patient industry and inflexible love of
truth which characterises the philosophy of the present day.It takes up
the history of the world at the point where it is left by its elder
sister Geology, and, following the same line of argument, strives to
reduce to the same scientific mode of expression the apparent chaos of
facts which have hitherto been looked upon as inexplicable by the
general observer.It is only within the limits of the present century that Geology was
rescued from the dreams of cataclysms and convulsions which formed the
staple of the science in the last century; and that step by step, by
slow degrees, rocks have been classified and phenomena explained.All
that picturesque wildness with which the materials seemed at first sight
to be distributed over the world’s surface has been reduced to order,
and they now lie arranged as clearly, and as certainly in the mind of a
geologist, as if they had been squared by the tool of a mason and placed
in order by the hand of a mechanic.Race has
succeeded race;—all have been disturbed, some obliterated—many
contorted—and sometimes the older, apparently, superimposed upon the
newer.All at first sight is chaos and confusion, and it seems almost
hopeless to attempt to unravel the mysteries of the long-forgotten past.It is true nevertheless, in Ethnology, as in the sister science, that no
change on the world’s surface has taken place without leaving its mark.A race may be obliterated, or only crop up at the edge of some great
basin of population; but it has left its traces either as fossil remains
in the shape of buildings or works, or as impressions on language or on
the arts of those who supplanted the perishing race.When these are
read,—when all the phenomena are gathered together and classified, we
find the same perfection of Order, the same beautiful simplicity of law
pervading the same complex variety of results, which characterise all
the phenomena of nature, and the knowledge of which is the highest
reward of intellectual exertion.Language has hitherto been the great implement of analysis which has
been employed to elucidate the affiliation of races; and the present
state of the science may be said to be almost entirely due to the acumen
and industry of learned linguists.Physiology has lent her aid; but the
objects offered for her examination are so few, especially in remote
ages, and the individual differences are so small, as compared with the
general resemblance, that, in the present state of that science, its aid
has not been of the importance which it may fairly be expected hereafter
to assume.In both sciences History plays an important part: in Geology,
by furnishing analogies without which it would be hardly possible to
interpret the facts; in Ethnology, by pointing out the direction in
which inquiries should be made, and by guiding and controlling the
conclusions which may have been arrived at.With the assistance of these
sciences, Ethnologists have accomplished a great deal, and may do more;
but Ethnology, based merely on Language[16] and Physiology, is like
Geology based only on Mineralogy and Chemistry.Without Palæontology,
that science would never have assumed the importance or reached the
perfection to which it has now attained; and Ethnology will never take
the place which it is really entitled to, till its results are checked,
and its conclusions elucidated, by the science of Archæology.Without the aid and vivifying influence derived from the study of fossil
remains, Geology would lose half its value and more than half its
interest.It may be interesting to the man of science to know what rock
is superimposed upon another, and how and in what relative periods these
changes occurred; but it is far more interesting to watch the dawn of
life on this globe, and to trace its development into the present
teeming stage of existence.So it will be when, with the aid of
Archæology, Ethnologists are able to identify the various strata in
which mankind have been distributed; to fix identities of race from
similarities of Art; and to read the history of the past from the
unconscious testimony of material remains.When properly studied and
understood, there is no language so clear, or whose testimony is so
undoubted, as that of those petrified thoughts and feelings which men
have left engraved on the walls of their temples, or buried with them in
the chambers of their tombs.Unconsciously expressed, but imperishably
written, they are there to this hour.Any one who likes may read, and no
one who can translate them can for one moment doubt but that they are
the best, and frequently the only, records that remain of bygone races.It is not difficult to explain why ethnographers have not hitherto
considered Archæology of that importance to their researches to which it
is undoubtedly entitled.We live in an age when all Art is a chaos of
copying and confusion; we are daily masquerading in the costume of every
nation of the earth, ancient and modern, and are unable to realise that
these dresses in which we deck ourselves were once realities.Because
Architecture, since the Reformation in the sixteenth century, has in
Europe been a mere _hortus siccus_ of dried specimens of the art of all
countries and of all ages, we cannot feel that, before that time, Art
was earnest and progressive; and that men then did what they felt to be
best and most appropriate, by the same processes by which Nature works.We do not therefore perceive that, though in an infinitely lower grade,
we may reason of the works of man before a given date, with the same
certainty with which we can reason of those of Nature.When this great
fact is once recognised—and it is indisputable—Archæology and
Palæontology take their places side by side, as the guiding and
vivifying elements in the sister sciences of Ethnology and Geology; and
give to each of these a value they could never otherwise attain.As may well be expected, however, when Archæology is employed to aid in
these researches, results are frequently arrived at, which at first
sight are discrepant from those to which the study of language alone has
hitherto led scientific men.But this is no proof either of the truth or
falsehood of the conclusions arrived at, or of the value or
worthlessness of the processes employed.Both are essential to the
question of knowledge, and it is by a skilful balancing of both classes
of evidence that truth is ultimately arrived at.It would be out of place to attempt in an introduction like the present
anything approaching to a complete investigation of this subject.The various ethnographic relations of one style to another
will be pointed out as they arise in the course of the narrative, and
their influence traced to such an extent as may be necessary to render
them intelligible.But for the same reasons which made it expedient to
try, in the preceding pages, to define the meaning of the term
architecture and to point out its position and limits, it is believed
that it will add to the clearness of what follows if the typical
characteristics of the principal races[17] of mankind with whom the
narrative deals, are first defined as clearly, though as succinctly as
possible.As the object of introducing the subject here is not to write an essay
on Ethnology, but to render the history of Architecture interesting and
intelligible, it may be expedient to avoid all speculation as to the
origin of mankind, or the mode in which the various races diverged from
one another and became so markedly distinct.Stretch the history of
Architecture as we will, we cannot get beyond the epoch of the Pyramid
builders (3500 B.C.), and when these were erected the various races of
mankind had acquired those distinctive characteristics which mark them
now.Not long afterwards, when the tombs at Beni Hassan were painted
(2500 B.C.), these distinctions were so marked and so well understood,
that these pictures might serve for the illustration of a book on
Ethnography at the present day.Nor will it be necessary in this
preliminary sketch to attempt more than to point out the typical
features of the four great building races of mankind.The Turanian, the
Semitic, the Celtic, and the Aryan.Even with regard to these, all that
will be necessary will be to point out the typical characteristics
without even attempting to define too accurately their boundaries, and
leaving the minuter gradations to be developed in the sequel.The one great fact which it is essential to insist on here is, that if
we do not take into account its connexion with Ethnography, the History
of Architecture is a mere dry, hard recapitulation of uninteresting
facts and terms; but when its relation to the world’s history is
understood,—when we read in their buildings the feelings and aspirations
of the people who erected them, and above all through their arts we can
trace their relationship to, and their descent from one another, the
study becomes one of the most interesting, as well as one of the most
useful which can be presented to an inquiring mind.The result of recent researches has enabled the ethnographer to divide
and arrange prehistoric man into three great groups or periods, which in
Europe at least seem to have succeeded to one another; though at what
time has not yet been determined even approximately; nor is it known how
long any of the three subsisted before it was superseded by the next,
nor how far the one overlapped the other, or indeed, whether, as was
almost certainly the case, at some time all three may not have subsisted
together.The first is called the Stone age, from the rude race who then peopled
Europe having no knowledge of the use of metals.All the cutting parts
of their implements were formed of flint or other hard stones, probably
fitted with wooden or bone handles, and used as tools of these
materials.These were succeeded by a people having a knowledge of the use of copper
and tin, with the possession of gold, and perhaps silver.Their
principal weapons and tools were formed of a compound of the two
first-named metals; and their age has consequently been called the age
of Bronze.Both these were superseded, perhaps in historic times, by a people
having a knowledge of the properties and use of Iron.Hence their epoch
came to be distinguished by the name of that metal.There seems no doubt but that the people of the Stone age were
generally, if not exclusively, of that great family which we now know as
the Turanian.The race who introduced bronze seem to have been the ancestors of the
Celtic races who afterwards peopled so large a portion of Europe.The Aryans were those who introduced the use of iron, and with it
dominated over and expelled the older races.If any prehistoric traces of the Semitic races are to be found, they
must be looked for in Western Asia or in Africa; they certainly had no
settlements in Europe.Further researches may perhaps at some future time enable us to fix
approximative dates to these various migrations.At present we know that
men using flint implements lived in the valleys of the Garonne and
Dordogne when the climate of the south of France was as cold as that of
Lapland, or perhaps Greenland; when the reindeer was their principal
domestic animal, and the larger animals of the country belonged to
species many of which had ceased to inhabit those regions before the
dawn of history.On the other hand, we may assert with certainty that
the climate of Egypt has not varied since the age of the Pyramid
builders; and there is nothing in the history of either Greece or Italy
that would lead us to believe that any remarkable alteration in the
climate of these countries has taken place in historic times.These questions, however, hardly come within the scope of the present
work.The men of the Stone age have left nothing which can be styled
architecture, unless we include in that term the rude tumuli of earth
with which they covered the remains of their dead.It is also extremely
uncertain if we can identify any building of stone as belonging
certainly to the age of Bronze.All the rude cromlechs, dolmens,
menhirs, &c., which usher in the early dawn of civilisation in Europe,
belong, it is true to the earlier races, but seem to have been erected
by them at a time when the Aryan races had taught them the use of iron,
and they had learnt to appreciate the value of stone as a monumental
record.This, however, was at a period long subsequent to the use of
iron in Egypt and the East, and long after architecture had attained
maturity; and its history became easily and distinctly legible in the
Valley of the Nile.[18]

The great feature in the history of the Turanian races is that they
were the first to people the whole world beyond the limits of the
original cradle of mankind.Like the primitive unstratified rocks of
geologists, they form the substructure of the whole world, frequently
rising into the highest and most prominent peaks, sometimes
overflowing whole districts and occupying a vast portion of the
world’s surface;—everywhere underlying all the others, and affording
their disintegrated materials to form the more recent strata that now
overlie and frequently obliterate them,—in appearance at least.In the old world the typical Turanians were the Egyptians; in the modern
the Chinese and Japanese; and to these we are perhaps justified in
adding the Mexicans.If this last adscription stands good, we have at
three nearly equidistant points (120 degrees apart) on the earth’s
surface, and under the tropic of Cancer, the three great culminating
points of this form of civilisation.The outlying strata in Asia are the
Tamuls, who now occupy the whole of the south of India, and all the
races now existing in the countries between India and China.The
Turanians existed in the Valley of the Euphrates before the Semitic or
Aryan races came there.The Tunguses in the north are Turanians, and so
are the Mongols, the Turks, and all those tribes generally described as
Tartars.In Europe the oldest people of this family we are acquainted with are
the Pelasgi and Etruscans, but the race also crops up in the Magyars,
the Finns, the Lapps, and in odd broken fragments here and there, but
everywhere overpowered by the more civilised Aryans, who succeeded and
have driven them into the remotest corners of the continent.In Africa they have been almost as completely overpowered by the Semitic
race, and in America are now being everywhere as entirely overwhelmed as
they were in Europe by the Aryan races, and in all probability must
eventually disappear altogether.Even if the linguist should hesitate to affirm that all their languages
can be traced to a common root, or present sufficient affinities for a
classification, the general features of the races enumerated above are
so alike the one to the other, that, for all real ethnographic purposes,
they may certainly be considered as belonging to one great group.Whether nearly obliterated, as they are in most parts of Europe, or
whether they still retain their nationality, as in the eastern parts of
Asia, they always appear as the earliest of races, and everywhere
present peculiarities of feeling and civilisation easily recognised, and
which distinguish them from all the other races of mankind.If they do not all speak cognate languages, or if we cannot now trace
their linguistic affinities, we must not too readily assume that
therefore they are distinct the one from the other.It must be more
philosophical to believe, what probably is the case, that the one
instrument of analysis we have hitherto used is not sufficient for the
purpose, and we ought consequently to welcome every other process which
will throw further light on the subject.RELIGION OF THE TURANIANS.It is perhaps not too much to assert that no Turanian race ever rose to
the idea of a God external to the world.All their gods were men who had
lived with them on the face of the earth.In the old world they were
kings,—men who had acquired fame from the extent of their power, or
greatness from their wisdom.The Buddhist reform taught the Turanian
races that virtue, not power, was true greatness, and that the humblest
as well as the highest might attain beatitude through the practice of
piety.All the Turanians have a distinct idea of rewards and punishments after
death, and generally also of a preparatory purgatory by transmigration
through the bodies of animals, clean or unclean according to the actions
of the defunct spirit, but always ending in another world.With some
races transmigration becomes nearly all in all; in others it is nearly
evanescent, and Heaven and Hell take its place; but the two are
essentially doctrines of this race.From the fact of their gods having been only ordinary mortals, and all
men being able to aspire to the godhead, their form of worship was
essentially anthropic and ancestral; their temples were palaces, where
the gods sat on thrones and received petitions and dispensed justice as
in life, and where men paid that homage to the image of the dead which
they would have paid to the living king.They were in fact the
idolators, _par excellence_.Their tombs were even more sacred than
their temples, and their reverence was more frequently directed to the
remains of their ancestors than to the images of their gods.Hence arose
that reverence for relics which formed so marked a feature in their
ritual in all ages, and which still prevails among many races almost in
the direct ratio in which Turanian blood can be traced in their veins.Unable to rise above humanity in their conceptions of the deity, they
worshipped all material things.Trees with them in all times were
objects of veneration, and of especial worship in particular localities.The mysterious serpent was with them a god, and the bull in most
Turanian countries a being to be worshipped.The sun, the moon, the
stars, all filled niches in their Pantheon; in fact, whatever they saw
they believed in, whatever they could not comprehend they worshipped.They cared not to inquire beyond the evidence of their senses, and were
incapable of abstracting their conceptions.To the Turanians also is due
that peculiar reverence for localities made celebrated by great
historical events, or rendered sacred by being the scene of great
religious events, and hence to them must be ascribed the origin of
pilgrimages, and all their concomitant adjuncts and ceremonies.It is to this race also that we owe the existence of human sacrifices.Always fatalists, always and everywhere indifferent of life, and never
fearing death, these sacrifices never were to them so terrible as they
appear to more highly-organised races.Thus a child, a relative, or a
friend, was the most precious, and consequently the most acceptable
offering a man could bring to appease the wrath or propitiate the favour
of a god who had been human, and who was supposed to have retained all
the feelings of humanity for ever afterwards.It is easy to trace their Tree and Serpent worship in every corner of
the old world from Anuradhapura in Ceylon, to Upsala in Sweden.Their
tombs and tumuli exist everywhere.Their ancestral worship is the
foundation at the present day of half the popular creeds of the world,
and the planets have hardly ceased to be worshipped at the present hour.Most of the more salient peculiarities of this faith were softened down
by the great Buddhist reform in the sixth century B.C., and that
refinement of their rude primitive belief has been adopted by most of
the Turanian people of the modern world, and is now almost exclusively
the appanage of people having Turanian blood in their veins.Even,
however, through the gloss of their Buddhist refinements we can still
discern most of the old forms of faith, and even its most devoted
votaries are yet hardly more than half converted.The only form of government ever adopted by any people of Turanian race
was that of absolute despotism,—with a tribe, a chief,—in a kingdom, a
despot.In highly civilised communities, like those of Egypt and China,
their despotism was tempered by bureaucratic forms, but the chief was
always as absolute as a Timour or an Attila, though not always strong
enough to use his power as terribly as they did.Their laws were real or
traditional edicts of their kings, seldom written, and never
administered according to any fixed form of procedure.As a consequence or a cause of this, the Turanian race are absolutely
casteless; no hereditary nobility, no caste of priests ever existed
among them; between the ruler and the people there could be nothing, and
every one might aspire equally to all the honours of the State, or to
the highest dignity of the priesthood.“La carrière ouverte aux talens,”
is essentially the motto of these races or of those allied to them, and
whether it was the slave of a Pharaoh, or the pipe-bearer of a Turkish
sultan, every office except the throne is and always was open to the
ambitious.No republic, no limited monarchy, ever arose among them.Despotism pure and simple is all they ever knew, or are even now capable
of appreciating.Woman among the Turanian races was never regarded otherwise than as the
helpmate of the poor and the plaything of the rich; born to work for the
lower classes and to administer to the gratification of the higher.No
equality of rights or position was ever dreamt of, and the consequence
was polyandry where people were poor and women scarce, and polygamy
where wealth and luxury prevailed; and with these it need hardly be
added, a loss of half those feelings which ennoble man or make life
valuable.Neither loving nor beloved in the bosom of his own family,—too much of a
fatalist to care for the future,—neither enjoying life nor fearing
death,—the Turanian is generally free from those vices which contaminate
more active minds; he remains sober, temperate, truthful, and kindly in
all the relations of life.If, however, he has few vices, he has fewer
virtues, and both are far more passive than active in their nature,—in
fact, approach more nearly to the instincts of the lower animals than to
the intellectual responsibilities of the highest class of minds.No Turanian race ever distinguished itself in literature, properly so
called.They all possessed annals, because they loved to record the
names, the dates, and the descent of their ancestors; but these never
rose to the dignity of history even in its simplest form.Prose they
could hardly write, because none of the greater groups ever appreciated
the value of an alphabet.Hieroglyphics, signs, symbols, anything
sufficed for their simple intellectual wants, and they preferred
trusting to memory to remember what a sign stood for, rather than
exercise their intellect to compound or analyse a complex alphabetical
arrangement.Their system of poetry helped them, to some extent, over
the difficulty; and, with a knowledge of the metre, a few suggestive
signs enabled the reader to remember at least a lyric composition.But
without a complex grammar to express and an alphabet to record their
conceptions it is hopeless to expect that either Epic or Dramatic Poetry
could flourish, still less that a prose narrative of any extent could be
remembered; and philosophy, beyond the use of proverbs, was out of the
question.In their most advanced stages they have, like the Chinese, invented
syllabaria of hideous complexity, and have even borrowed alphabets from
their more advanced neighbours.By some it is supposed that they have
even invented them; but though they have thus got over the mechanical
difficulties of the case, their intellectual condition remains the same,
and they have never advanced beyond the merest rudiments of a
literature, and have never mastered even the elements of any scientific
philosophy.If so singularly deficient in the phonetic modes of literary expression,
the Turanian races made up for it to a great extent in the excellence
they attained in most of the branches of æsthetic art.As architects
they were unsurpassed, and in Egypt alone have left monuments which are
still the world’s wonder.The Tamul race in Southern, the Moguls in
Northern India, in Burmah, in China, and in Mexico, wherever these races
are found, they have raised monuments of dimensions unsurpassed; and,
considering the low state of civilisation in which they often existed,
displaying a degree of taste and skill as remarkable as it is
unexpected.In consequence of the circumstance above mentioned of their gods having
been kings, and after death still only considered as watching over and
influencing the destiny of mankind, their temples were only exaggerated
palaces, containing halls, and chambers, and thrones, and all the
appurtenances required by the living, but on a scale befitting the
celestial character now acquired.So much is this the case in Egypt that
we hardly know by which name to designate them, and the same remark
applies to all.Even more sacred, however, than their temples were their tombs.Wherever
a Turanian race exists or existed, there their tombs remain; and from
the Pyramids of Egypt to the mausoleum of Hyder Ali, the last Tartar
king in India, they form the most remarkable series of monuments the
world possesses, and all were built by people of Turanian race.No
Semite and no Aryan ever built a tomb that could last a century or was
worthy to remain so long.The Buddhist reform altered the funereal tumulus into a relic shrine,
modifying this, as it did most of the Turanian forms of utterance, from
a literal to a somewhat more spiritual form of expression, but leaving
the meaning the same,—the Tope being still essentially a Tomb.Combined with that wonderful appreciation of form which characterises
all the architectural works of the Turanians, they possessed an
extraordinary passion for  decoration and an instinctive
knowledge of the harmony of colours.They used throughout the primitive
colours in all their elemental crudeness; and though always brilliant,
are never vulgar, and are guiltless of any mistake in harmony.From the
first dawn of painting in Egypt to the last signboard in Constantinople
or Canton, it is always the same,—the same brilliancy and harmony
produced by the simplest means.Having no explanatory
literature to which to refer, it was necessary that their statues should
tell their whole tale themselves; and sculpture does not lend itself to
this so readily as painting.With them it is not sufficient that a god
should be colossal, he must be symbolical; he must have more arms and
legs or more heads than common men; he must have wings and attributes of
power, or must combine the strength of a lion or a bull with the
intellect of humanity.The statue must, in short, tell the whole story
itself; and where this is attempted the result can only be pleasing to
the narrow faith of the unreflecting devotee.So far from being able to
express more than humanity, sculpture must attempt even less if it would
be successful; but this of course rendered it useless for the purposes
to which the Turanians wished to apply it.The same remarks apply to painting, properly so called.This never can
attain its highest development except when it is the exponent of
phonetic utterances.In Greece the painter strove only to give form and
substance to the more purely intellectual creation of the poet, and
could consequently dispense with all but the highest elements of his
art.In Egypt the picture was all in all; it had no text to refer to,
and must tell the whole tale with all its adjuncts, in simple
intelligible prose, or be illegible, and the consequence is that the
story is told with a clearness that charms us even now.It is however,
only a story; and, like everything else Turanian, however great or
wonderful, its greatness and its wonder are of a lower class and less
intellectual than the utterances of the other great divisions of the
human family.We have scarcely the means of knowing whether any Turanian race ever
successfully cultivated music to any extent.It is more than probable
that all their families can and always could appreciate the harmony of
musical intervals, and might be charmed with simple cadences; but it is
nearly certain that a people who did not possess phonetic poetry could
never rise to that higher class of music which is now carried to such a
pitch of perfection, that harmonic combinations almost supply the place
of phonetic expression and influence the feelings and passions to almost
the same extent.There is also this further peculiarity about their arts, that they seem
always more instinctive than intellectual, and consequently are
incapable of that progress which distinguishes most of the works of man.At the first dawn of art in Egypt, in the age of the Pyramid builders,
all the arts were as perfect and as complete as they were when the
country fell under the domination of the Romans.The earliest works in
China are as perfect—in some respects more so—as those of to-day; and in
Mexico, so soon as a race of red savages peopled a country so densely as
to require art and to appreciate magnificence, the arts sprung up among
them with as much perfection, we may fairly assume, as they would have
attained had they been practised for thousands of years under the same
circumstances and uninfluenced by foreigners.It is even more startling
to find that the arts of the savages who inhabited the south of France,
on the skirts of the glacial period, are identical with those of the
Esquimaux of the present day, and even at that early time attained a
degree of perfection which is startling, and could hardly be surpassed
by any people in the same condition of life at the present day.There is no reason to suppose that any people occupying so low a
position in the intellectual scale could ever cultivate anything
approaching to abstract science, and there is no proof of it existing.Living, however, as they did, on the verge of the tropics, in the most
beautiful climates of the world, and where the sky is generally serene
and unclouded, it was impossible but that they should become to some
extent astronomers.It is not known that any of them ever formed any theory to account for
the phenomena they observed, but they seem to have watched the paths of
the planets, to have recorded eclipses, and generally to have noted
times and events with such correctness as enabled them to predict their
return with very considerable precision; but here their science stopped,
and it is not known that they ever attempted any other of the
multifarious branches of modern knowledge.We have only very imperfect means of knowing what their agriculture was;
but it seems always to have been careful when once they passed from the
shepherd state, though whether scientific or not it is not easy to say.On the point of artificial irrigation the Turanians have always been
singularly expert.Wherever you follow their traces, the existence of a
tunnel is almost as certain an indication of their pre-existence as that
of a tomb.It is amusing, as it is instructive, to see at this hour an
Arab Pacha breaking down in his attempts to restore the irrigation works
of the old Pharaohs, or an English Engineer officer blundering in his
endeavours to copy the works instinctively performed by a Mogul, or a
Spaniard trying to drain the lakes of Mexico.Building and irrigation
were the special instincts of this old people, and the practical
intellect of the higher races seems hardly yet to have come up to the
point where these arts were left by the early Turanian races, while the
perfection they attained in them is the more singular from the contrast
it affords to what they did, or rather, did not do, in other branches of
art or science.III.—SEMITIC RACES.From the extraordinary influence the Semitic races have had in the
religious development of mankind, we are apt to consider them as
politically more important than they really ever were.At no period of
their history do they seem to have numbered more than twenty or thirty
millions of souls.The principal locality in which they developed
themselves was the small tract of country between the Tigris, the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea; but they also existed as a separate race
in Abyssinia, and extended their colonies along the northern coast of
Africa.Their intellectual development has been in all ages so superior
to that of the Turanian races, that they have subdued them mentally
wherever they came in contact with them; and notwithstanding their
limited geographical extension, they have influenced the intellect of
the Aryan tribes to a greater extent than almost any of their own
congeners.If anything were required to justify the ethnographer in treating the
various families of mankind as distinct and separate varieties, it would
be the study of the history of the Semitic race.What they were in the
time of Abraham, that they are at the present day.A large section of
them sojourned in Egypt, among people of a different race, and they came
out as unmixed as oil would do that is floated on water.For the last
two thousand years they have dwelt dispersed among the Gentiles, without
a nationality, almost without a common language, yet they remain the
same in feature, the same in intellectual development and feeling, they
exhibit the same undying repugnance to all except those of their own
blood, which characterised the Arab and the Jew when we first recognise
their names in history.So unchangeable are they in this respect, that
it seems in vain to try to calculate how long this people must have
lived by themselves, separated from other races, that they should have
thus acquired that distinctive fixity of character nothing can alter or
obliterate, and which is perhaps even more wonderful intellectually than
are the woolly hair and physical characteristics of the <DW64>, though
not so obvious to the superficial observer.From the circumstance of our possessing a complete series of the
religious literature of the Semitic race, extending over the two
thousand years which elapsed between Moses and Mahomet, we are enabled
to speak on this point with more precision than we can regarding the
doctrines of almost any other people.The great and distinguishing tenet of this race when pure is and always
seems to have been the unity of God, and his not being born of man.Unlike the gods of the Turanians, their Deity never was man, never
reigned or lived on earth, but was the Creator and Preserver of the
universe, living before all time, and extending beyond all space; though
it must be confessed they have not always expressed this idea with the
purity and distinctness which might be desired.It is uncertain how far they adhered to this purity of belief in
Assyria, where they were more mixed up with other races than they have
ever been before or since.In Syria, where they were superimposed upon
and mixed with a people of Turanian origin, they occasionally worshipped
stones and groves, serpents, and even bulls; but they inevitably
oscillated back to the true faith and retained it to the last.In
Arabia, after they became dominant, they cast off their Turanian
idolatries, and rallied as one man to the watchword of their race,
“There is no God but God,” expressed with a clearness that nothing can
obscure, and clung to it with a tenacity that nothing could shake or
change.Since then they have never represented God as man, and hardly
ever looked upon Him as actuated by the feelings of humanity.The channel of communication between God and man has always been, with
all the Semitic races, by means of prophecy.Prophets are sent, or are
inspired, by God, to communicate His will to man, to propound His laws,
and sometimes to foretell events; but in all instances without losing
their character as men, or becoming more than messengers for the special
service for which they are sent.With the Jews, but with them only, does there seem to have been a priest
caste set aside for the special service of God; not selected from all
the people, as would have been the case with the casteless Turanians,
but deriving their sanctity from descent, as would have been the case
with the Aryans; still they differed from the Aryan institution inasmuch
as the Levites always retained the characteristics of a tribe, and never
approached the form of an aristocracy.They may therefore be considered
ethnographically as an intermediate institution, partaking of the
characteristics of the other two races.The one point in which the Semitic form of religion seems to come in
contact with the Turanian is that of sacrifice—human, in early times
perhaps, even till the time of Abraham, but afterwards only of oxen and
sheep and goats in hecatombs; and this apparently not among the Arabs,
but only with the Jews and the less pure Phœnicians.From their having no human gods they avoided all the palatial temples or
ceremonial forms of idolatrous worship.Strictly speaking, they have no
temples.There was one holy place in the old world, the Hill of Zion at
Jerusalem, and one in the new dispensation, the Kaaba at Mecca.Solomon,
it is true, adorned the first to an extent but little consonant with the
true feeling of his race, but the Kaaba remains in its primitive
insignificance; and neither of these temples, either then or now, derive
their sanctity from the buildings.They are the spots where God’s
prophets stood and communicated His will to man.It is true that in
after ages a Roman Tetrarch and a Turkish Sultan surrounded these two
Semitic cells with courts and cloisters, which made them wonders of
magnificence in the cities where they existed; but this does not affect
the conclusion that no Semitic race ever erected a durable building, or
even thought of possessing more than one temple at a time, or cared to
emulate the splendour of the temple-palaces of the Turanians.Although no Semitic race was ever quite republican, which is a purely
Aryan characteristic, they never sank under such an unmitigated
despotism as is generally found among the Turanians.When in small
nuclei, their form of government is what is generally called
patriarchal, the chief being neither necessarily hereditary, nor
necessarily elective, but attaining his headship partly by the influence
due to age and wisdom, or to virtue, partly to the merits of his
connexions, and sometimes of his ancestors; but never wholly to the
latter without some reference at least to the former.In larger aggregations the difficulty of selection made the chiefship
more generally hereditary; but even then the power of the King was
always controlled by the authority of the written law, and never sank
into the pure despotism of the Turanians.With the Jews, too, the sacred
caste of the Levites always had considerable influence in checking any
excesses of kingly power; but more was due in this respect to their
peculiar institution of prophets, who, protected by the sacredness of
their office, at all times dared to act the part of tribunes of the
people, and to rebuke with authority any attempt on the part of the King
to step beyond the limits of the constitution.One of the most striking characteristics in the morals of the Semitic
races is the improvement in the position of woman, and the attempt to
elevate her in the scale of existence.If not absolutely monogamic,
there is among the Jews, and among the Arabic races where they are pure,
a strong tendency in this direction; and but for the example of those
nations among whom they were placed, they might have gone further in
this direction, and the dignity of mankind have been proportionately
improved.Their worst faults arise from their segregation from the rest of
mankind.With them war against all but those of their own race is an
obligation and a pleasure, and it is carried on with a relentless
cruelty which knows no pity.To smite root and branch, to murder men,
women, and children, is a duty which admits of no hesitation, and has
stained the character of the Semites in all ages.Against this must be
placed the fact that they are patriotic beyond all other races, and
steadfast in their faith as no other people have ever been; and among
themselves they have been tempered to kindness and charity by the
sufferings they have had to bear because of their uncompromising hatred
and repugnance to all their fellow-men.This isolation has had the further effect of making them singularly
apathetic to all that most interests the other nations of the earth.What their God has revealed to them through His prophets suffices for
them.“God is great,” is a sufficient explanation with them for all the
wonders of science.“God wills it,” solves all the complex problems of
the moral government of the world.If not such absolute fatalists as the
Turanians, they equally shrink from the responsibility of thinking for
themselves, or of applying their independent reason to the great
problems of human knowledge.They may escape by this from many
aberrations that trouble more active minds, but their virtues at best
can be but negative, and their vices unredeemed by the higher
aspirations that sometimes half ennoble even crime.In this again we have an immense advance above all the Turanian races.No Semitic people ever used a hieroglyph or mere symbol, or were content
to trust to memory only.Everywhere and at all times—so far as we
know—they used an alphabet of more or less complicated form.Whether
they invented this mode of notation or not is still unknown, but its use
by them is certain; and the consequence is that they possess, if not the
oldest, at least one of the very oldest literatures of the world.History with them is no longer a mere record of names and titles, but a
chronicle of events, and with the moral generally elicited.The story
and the rhapsody take their places side by side, the preaching and the
parable are used to convey their lessons to the world.If they had not
the Epos and the Drama, they had lyric poetry of a beauty and a pathos
which has hardly ever been surpassed.It was this possession of an alphabet, conjoined with the sublimity of
their monotheistic creed, that gave these races the only superiority to
which they have attained.It is this which has enabled them to keep
themselves pure and undefiled in all the catastrophes to which they have
been exposed, and that still enables their literature and their creed to
exert an influence over almost all the nations of the earth, even in
times when the people themselves have been held in most supreme
contempt.It may have been partly in consequence of their love of phonetic
literature, and partly in order to keep themselves distinct from those
great builders the Turanians, that the Semitic races never erected a
building worthy of the name; neither at Jerusalem, nor at Tyre or Sidon,
nor at Carthage, is there any vestige of Semitic Architectural Art.Not
that these have perished, but because they never existed.When Solomon
proposed to build a temple at Jerusalem, though plain externally, and
hardly so large as an ordinary parish church, he was forced to have
recourse to some Turanian people to do it for him, and by a display of
gold and silver and brass ornaments to make up for the architectural
forms he knew not how to apply.In Assyria we have palaces of dynasties more or less purely Semitic,
splendid enough, but of wood and sunburnt bricks, and only preserved to
our knowledge from the accident of their having been so clumsily built
as to bury themselves and their wainscot slabs in their own ruins.Though half the people were probably of Turanian origin, their temples
seem to have been external and unimportant till Sennacherib and others
learnt the art of using stone from the Egyptians, as the Syrians did
afterwards from the Romans.During the domination of the last-named
people, we have the temples of Palmyra and Baalbec, of Jerusalem and
Petra: everywhere an art of the utmost splendour, but with no trace of
Semitic feeling or Semitic taste in any part, or in any detail.The Jewish worship being neither ancestral, nor the bodies of their dead
being held in special reverence, they had no tombs worthy of the name.They buried the bodies of their patriarchs and kings with care, and knew
where they were laid; but not until after the return from the Babylonish
captivity did they either worship there, or mark the spot with any
architectural forms, though after that epoch we find abundant traces of
a tendency towards that especial form of Turanian idolatry.But even
then the adornment of their tombs with architectural magnificence cannot
be traced back to an earlier period than the time of the Romans; and all
that we find marked with splendour of this class was the work of that
people, and stamped with their peculiar forms of Art.Painting and sculpture were absolutely forbidden to the Jews because
they were Turanian arts, and because their practice might lead the
people to idolatry, so that these nowhere existed: though we cannot
understand a people with any mixture of Turanian blood who had not an
eye for colour, and a feeling for beauty of form, in detail at least.Music alone was therefore the one æsthetic art of the Semitic races,
and, wedded to the lyric verse, seems to have influenced their feelings
and excited their passions to an extent unknown to other nations; but to
posterity it cannot supply the place of the more permanent arts, whose
absence is so much felt in attempting to realise the feelings or
aspirations of a people like this.[19]

As regards the useful arts, the Semites were always more pastoral than
agricultural, and have not left in the countries they inhabited any
traces of such hydraulic works as the earlier races executed; but in
commerce they excelled all nations.The Jews—from their inland
situation, cut off from all access to the sea—could not do much in
foreign trade; but they always kept up their intercourse with Assyria.The Phœnicians traded backwards and forwards with every part of the
Mediterranean, and first opened out a knowledge of the Atlantic; and the
Arabs first commenced, and for long afterwards alone carried on, the
trade with India.From the earliest dawn of history to the present hour,
commerce has been the art which the Semitic nations have cultivated with
the greatest assiduity, and in which they consequently have attained the
greatest, and an unsurpassed success.In Asia and in Africa at the present day, all the native trade is
carried on by Arabs; and it need hardly be remarked that the monetary
transactions of the rest of the world are practically managed by the
descendants of those who, one thousand years before Christ, traded from
Eziongeber to Ophir.Although, as before mentioned, Astronomy was cultivated with
considerable success both in Egypt and Chaldæa, among the more
contemplative Turanians, nothing can be more unsatisfactory than the
references to celestial events, either in the Bible or the Koran, both
betraying an entire ignorance of even the elements of astronomical
science; and we have no proof that the Phœnicians were at all wiser than
their neighbours in this respect.The Semitic races seem always to have been of too poetical a temperament
to excel in mathematics or the mechanical sciences.If there is one
branch of scientific knowledge which they may be suspected of having
cultivated with success, it is the group of natural sciences.A love of
nature seems always to have prevailed with them, and they may have known
“the trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon to the hyssop that
springeth out of the wall, and the names of all the beasts, and the
fowls, and the creeping things, and the fishes;” but beyond this we know
of nothing that can be dignified by the name of science among the
Semitic races.They more than made up however for their deficient
knowledge of the exact sciences by the depth of their insight into the
springs of human action, and the sagacity of their proverbial
philosophy; and, more than even this, by that wonderful system of
Theology before which all the Aryan races of the world and many of the
Turanian bow at the present hour, and acknowledge it the basis of their
faith and the source of all their religious aspirations.It is extremely difficult to write anything very precise or very
satisfactory regarding the Celtic races, for the simple reason that,
within the limits of our historic knowledge, they never lived
sufficiently long apart from other races to develop a distinct form of
nationality, or to create either a literature or a polity by which they
could be certainly recognised.In this respect they form the most marked
contrast with the Semitic races.Instead of wrapping themselves up
within the bounds of the most narrow exclusiveness, the Celt everywhere
mixed freely with the people among whom he settled, and adopted their
manners and customs with a carelessness that is startling; while at the
same time he retained the principal characteristics of his race through
every change of circumstance and clime.Almost the only thing that can be predicated of them with certainty is,
that they were either the last wave of the Turanians, or, if another
nomenclature is preferred, the first wave of the Aryans, who, migrating
westward from their parent seat in Asia, displaced the original and more
purely Turanian tribes who occupied Europe before the dawn of history.But, in doing this, they seem to have mixed themselves so completely
with the races they were supplanting, that it is extremely difficult to
say now where one begins or where the other ends.We find their remains in Asia Minor, whence Ethnologists fancy that they
can trace a southern migration along the northern coast of Africa,
across the Straits of Gibraltar, into Spain, and thence to Ireland.A
more certain and more important migration, however, crossed the
Bosphorus, and following the valley of the Danube, threw one branch into
Italy, where they penetrated as far south as Rome; while the main body
settled in and occupied Gaul and Belgium, whence they peopled Britain,
and may have met the southern colonists in the Celtic Island of the
west.From this they are now migrating, still following the course of
the sun, to carry to the New World the same brilliant thoughtlessness
which has so thoroughly leavened all those parts of the Old in which
they have settled, and which so sorely puzzles the purer but more
matter-of-fact Aryan tribes with which they have come in contact.It may appear like a hard saying, but it seems nevertheless to be true,
to assert that no purely Celtic race ever rose to a perfect conception
of the unity of the Godhead.It may be that they only borrowed this from
the Turanians who preceded them; but whether imitative or innate, their
Theology admits of Kings and Queens of Heaven who were mortals on earth.They possess hosts of saints and angels, and a whole hierarchy of
heavenly powers of various degrees, to whom the Celt turns with as
confiding hope and as earnest prayer as ever Turanian did to the gods of
his Pantheon.If he does not reverence the bodies of the departed as the
Egyptian or Chinese, he at least adopts the Buddhist veneration for
relics, and attaches far more importance to funereal rites than was ever
done by any tribe of Aryans.The Celt is as completely the slave of a casteless priesthood as ever
Turanian Buddhist was, and loves to separate it from the rest of
mankind, as representing on earth the hierarchy in heaven, to which,
according to the Celtic creed, all may hope to succeed by practice of
their peculiar virtues.To this may be added, that his temples are as splendid, his ceremonials
as gorgeous, and the formula as unmeaning as any that ever graced the
banks of the Nile, or astonished the wanderer in the valleys of Thibet
or on the shores of the Eastern Ocean.It is still more difficult to speak of the Celtic form of government, as
no kingdom of this people ever existed by itself for any length of time;
and none, indeed, it may be suspected, could long hold together.It may,
however, be safely asserted, that no republican forms are possible with
a Celtic people, and no municipal institutions ever flourished among
them.The only form, therefore, we know of as peculiarly theirs, is
despotism; not necessarily personal, but rendered systematic by
centralised bureaucratic organisations, and tempered by laws in those
States which have reached any degree of stability or civilisation.Nothing but a strong centralised despotism can long co-exist with a
people too impatient to submit to the sacrifices and self-denial
inherent in all attempts at self-government, and too excitable to be
controlled, except by the will of the strongest, though it may also be
the least scrupulous among them.When in small bodies they are always governed by a chief, generally
hereditary, but always absolute; who is looked up to with awe, and
obeyed with a reverence that is unintelligible to the more independent
races of mankind.With such institutions, of course a real aristocracy is impossible; and
the restraints of caste must always have been felt to be intolerable.“La carrière ouverte aux talens” is their boast; though not to the same
extent as with the Turanians; and the selfish gratification of
individual ambition is consequently always preferred with them to the
more sober benefit of the general advancement of the community.If the Celts never were either polygamic or polyandric, they certainly
always retained very lax ideas with regard to the marriage-vow, and
never looked on woman’s mission as anything higher than to minister to
their sensual gratification.With them the woman that fulfils this
quality best always commands their admiration most.Beauty can do no
wrong—but without beauty woman can hardly rise above the level of the
common herd.The ruling passion in the mind of the Celt is war.Not like the
exclusive, intolerant Semite, a war of extermination or of proselytism,
but war from pure “gaieté de cœur” and love of glory.No Celt fears to
die if his death can gain fame or add to the stock of his country’s
glory; nor in a private fight does he fear death or feel the pain of a
broken head, if he has had a chance of shooting through the heart or
cracking the skull of his best friend at the same time.The Celt’s love
of excitement leads him frequently into excesses, and to a disregard of
truth and the virtues belonging to daily life, which are what really
dignify mankind; but his love of glory and of his country often go far
to redeem these deficiencies, and spread a halo over even his worst
faults, which renders it frequently difficult to blame what we feel in
soberness we ought to condemn.If love and war are the parents of song, the bard and the troubadour
ought to have left us a legacy of verse that would have filled the
libraries of Europe; and so they probably would had not the original
Celt been too illiterate to care to record the expressions of his
feelings.As it is, nine-tenths of the lyric literature of Europe is of
Celtic origin.The Epos and the Drama may belong to the Aryan; but in
the art of wedding music to immortal verse, and pouring forth a
passionate utterance in a few but beautiful words, the Celtic is only
equalled by the Semitic race.Their remaining literature is of such modern growth, and was so
specially copied from what had preceded it, or so influenced by the
contemporary effusions of other people, that it is impossible accurately
to discriminate what is due to race and what to circumstances.All that
can safely be said is, that Celtic literature is always more
epigrammatic, more brilliant, and more daring than that of the sober
Aryan; but its coruscations neither light to so great a depth, nor last
so long as less dazzling productions might do.They may be the most
brilliant, but they certainly do not belong to the highest class of
literary effort; nor is their effect on the destiny of man likely to be
so permanent.The true glory of the Celt in Europe is his artistic eminence.It is
perhaps not too much to assert that without his intervention we should
not have possessed in modern times a church worthy of admiration, or a
picture or a statue we could look at without shame.In their arts, too,—either from their higher status, or from their
admixture with Aryans,—we escape the instinctive fixity which makes the
arts of the pure Turanian as unprogressive as the works of birds or of
beavers.Restless intellectual progress characterises everything they
perform; and had their arts not been nipped in the bud by circumstances
over which they had no control, we might have seen something that would
have shamed even Greece and wholly eclipsed the arts of Rome.They have not, it is true, that instinctive knowledge of colour which
distinguishes the Turanian, nor have they been able to give to music
that intellectual culture which has been elaborated by the Aryans: but
in the middle path between the two they excel both.They are far better
musicians than the former, and far better colourists than the last-named
races; but in modern Europe Architecture is practically their own.Where
their influence was strongest, there Architecture was most perfect; as
they decayed, or as the Aryan influence prevailed, the art first
languished, and then died.Their quasi-Turanian theology required Temples almost as grand as those
of the Copts or Tamuls; and, like them, they sought to honour those who
had been mortals by splendour which mortals are assumed to be pleased
with; and the pomp of their worship always surpassed that with which
they honoured their Kings.Even more remarkable than this is the fact
that they could and did build Tombs such as a Turanian might have
envied, not for their size but for their art, and even now can adorn
their cemeteries with monuments which are not ridiculous.When a people are so mixed up with other races as the Celts are in
Europe,—frequently so fused as to be undistinguishable,—it is almost
impossible to speak with precision with regard either to their arts or
influence.It must in consequence be safer to assert that where no
Celtic blood existed there no real art is found; though it is perhaps
equally true to assert that not only Architecture, but Painting and
Sculpture, have been patronised, and have flourished in the exact ratio
in which Celtic blood is found prevailing in any people in Europe; and
has died out as Aryan influence prevails, in spite of their methodical
efforts to indoctrinate themselves with what must be the spontaneous
impulse of genius, if it is to be of any value.Of their sciences we know nothing till they were so steeped in the
civilisation of older races that originality was hopeless.Still, in the
stages through which the intellect of Europe has yet passed, they have
played their part with brilliancy.But now that knowledge is assuming a
higher and more prosaic phase, it is doubtful whether the deductive
brilliancy of the Celtic mind can avail anything against the inductive
sobriety of the Aryan.So long as metaphysics were science, and science
was theory, the peculiar form of the Celtic mind was singularly well
adapted to see through sophistry and to guess the direction in which
truth might lie.But now that we have only to question Nature, to
classify her answers, and patiently to record results, its mission seems
to have passed away.Truth in all its majesty, and Nature in all her
greatness, must now take the place of speculation, with its cleverness,
and man’s ideas of what might or should be, must be supplanted by the
knowledge of God’s works as they exist and the contemplation of the
eternal grandeur of the universe which we see around us.Though these are the highest, they are at the same time the most sober
functions of the human mind; and while conferring the greatest and most
lasting benefit, not only on the individual who practises them, but also
on the human race, they are neither calculated to gratify personal
vanity, nor to reward individual ambition.Such pursuits are not, therefore, of a nature to attract or interest the
Celtic races, but must be left to those who are content to sink their
personality in seeking the advantage of the common weal.According to their own chronology, it seems to have been about the year
3101 B.C.that the Aryans crossed the Indus and settled themselves in
the country between that river and the Jumna, since known among
themselves as Arya Varta, or the Country of the Just, for all succeeding
ages.More than a thousand years afterwards we find them, in the age of the
Ramayana, occupying all the country north of the Vindya range, and
attempting the conquest of the southern country,—then, as now, occupied
by Turanians,—and penetrating as far as Ceylon.Eight hundred years later we see them in the Mahabharata, having lost
much of their purity of blood, and adopting many of the customs and much
of the faith of the people they were settled amongst; and three
centuries before Christ we find they had so far degenerated as to
accept, almost without a struggle, the religion of Buddha; which, though
no doubt a reform, and an important one, on the Anthropic doctrines of
the pure Turanians, was still essentially a faith of a Turanian people;
congenial to them, and to them only.Ten centuries after Christ, when the Moslems came in contact with India,
the Aryan was a myth.The religion of the earlier people was everywhere
supreme, and with only a nominal thread of Aryanism running through the
whole, just sufficient to bear testimony to the prior existence of a
purer faith, but not sufficient to leaven the mass to any appreciable
extent.The fate of the western Aryans differed essentially from that of those
who wandered eastward.Theoretically we ought to assume, from their less
complex language and less pure faith, that they were an earlier
offshoot; but it may be that in the forests of Europe they lost for a
while the civilised forms which the happier climate of Arya Varta
enabled the others to retain; or it may be that the contact with the
more nearly equal Celtic races had mixed the language and the faith of
the western races, before they had the opportunity or the leisure to
record the knowledge they brought with them.Be this as it may, they first appear prominently in the western world in
Greece, where, by a fortunate union with the Pelasgi, a people
apparently of Turanian race, they produced a civilisation not purely
Aryan, and somewhat evanescent in its character, but more brilliant,
while it lasted, than anything the world had seen before, and in certain
respects more beautiful than anything that has illumined it since their
time.They next sprang forth in Rome, mixed with the Turanian Etruscans and
the powerful Celtic tribes of Italy; and lastly in Northern Europe,
where they are now working out their destiny, but to what issue the
future only can declare.The essential difference between the eastern and western migration is
this—that in India the Aryans have sunk gradually into the arms of a
Turanian people till they have lost their identity, and with it all that
ennobled them when they went there, or could enable them now to
influence the world again.In Europe they found the country cleared of Turanians by the earlier
Celts; and mingling their blood with these more nearly allied races,
they have raised themselves to a position half way between the two.Where they found the country unoccupied they have remained so pure that,
as their number multiplies, they may perhaps regain something of the
position they had temporarily abandoned, and something of that science
which, it may be fancied, mankind only knew in their primeval seats.What then was the creed of the primitive Aryans?So far as we can now
see, it was the belief in one great ineffable God,—so great that no
human intellect could measure His greatness,—so wonderful that no human
language could express His qualities,—pervading everything that was
made,—ruling all created things,—a spirit, around, beyond the universe,
and within every individual particle of it.A creed so ethereal could
not long remain the faith of the multitude, and we early find fire,—the
most ethereal of the elements,—looked to as an emblem of the Deity.The
heavens too received a name, and became an entity:—so did our mother
earth.To these succeeded the sun, the stars, the elements,—but never
among the pure Aryans as gods, or as influencing the destiny of man, but
as manifestations of His power, and reverenced because they were visible
manifestations of a Being too abstract for an ordinary mind to grasp.Below this the Aryans never seem to have sunk.With a faith so elevated of course no temple could be wanted; no human
ceremonial could be supposed capable of doing honour to a Deity so
conceived; nor any sacrifice acceptable to Him to whom all things
belonged.With the Aryans worship was a purely domestic institution;
prayer the solitary act of each individual man, standing alone in the
presence of an omniscient Deity.All that was required was that man
should acknowledge the greatness of God, and his own comparative
insignificance; should express his absolute trust and faith in the
beneficence and justice of his God, and a hope that he might be enabled
to live so pure, and so free from sin, as to deserve such happiness as
this world can afford, and be enabled to do as much good to others as it
is vouchsafed to man to perform.A few insignificant formulæ served to mark the modes in which these
subjects should recur.The recitation of a time-honoured hymn refreshed
the attention of the worshipper, and the reading of a few sacred texts
recalled the duties it was expected he should perform.With these simple
ceremonies the worship of the Aryans seems to have begun and ended.Even in later times, when their blood has become less pure, and their
feelings were influenced by association with those among whom they
resided, the religion of the Aryans always retained its intellectual
character.No dogma was ever admitted that would not bear the test of
reason, and no article of faith was ever assented to which seemed to
militate against the supremacy of intellect over all feelings and
passions.In all their wanderings they were always prepared to admit the
immeasurable greatness of the one incorporeal Deity, and the
impossibility of the human intellect approaching or forming any adequate
conception of His majesty.When they abandoned the domestic form of worship, they adopted the
congregational, and then not so much with the idea that it was pleasing
to God, as in order to remind each other of their duties, to regulate
and govern the spiritual wants of the community, and to inculcate piety
towards God and charity towards each other.It need hardly be added that superstition is impossible with minds so
constituted, and that science must always be the surest and the best
ally of a religion so pure and exalted, which is based on a knowledge of
God’s works, a consequent appreciation of their greatness, and an ardent
aspiration towards that power and goodness which the finite intellect of
man can never hope to reach.The most marked characteristic of the Aryans is their innate passion for
self-government.If not absolutely republican, the tendency of all their
institutions, at all times, has been towards that form, and in almost
the exact ratio to the purity of the blood do they adopt this form of
autocracy.If kingly power was ever introduced among them, it was always
in the form of a limited monarchy; never the uncontrolled despotism of
the other races; and every conceivable check was devised to prevent
encroachments of the crown, even if such were possible among a people so
organised as the Aryans always have been.With them every town was a municipality, every village a little
republic, and every trade a separate self-governing guild.Many of these
institutions have died out, or else fallen into neglect, in those
communities where equal rights and absolute laws have rendered each
individual a king in his own person, and every family a republic in
itself.The village system which the Aryans introduced into India is still the
most remarkable of its institutions.These little republican organisms
have survived the revolutions of fifty centuries.Neither the
devastations of war nor the indolence of peace seems to have affected
them.Under Brahmin, Buddhist, or Moslem, they remain the same unchanged
and unchangeable institutions, and neither despotism nor anarchy has
been able to alter them.They alone have saved India from sinking into a
state of savage imbecility, under the various hordes of conquerors who
have at times overrun her; and they, with the Vedas and the laws
afterwards embodied by Menu, alone remain as records of the old Aryan
possessors of the Indian peninsula.Municipalities, which are merely an enlargement of the Indian village
system, exist wherever the Romans were settled, or where the Aryan races
exist in Europe; and though guilds are fast losing their significance,
it was the Teutonic guilds that alone checked and ultimately supplanted
the feudal despotisms of the Celts.Caste is another institution of these races, which has always more or
less influenced all their actions.Where their blood has become so
impure as it is in India, caste has degenerated into an abuse; but where
it is a living institution, it is perhaps as conducive to the proper
regulation of society as any with which we are acquainted.The one thing
over which no man can have any control is the accident of his birth; but
it is an immense gain to him that he should be satisfied with the
station in which he finds himself, and content to do his duty in the
sphere in which he was born.Caste, properly understood, never
interferes with the accumulation of wealth or power within the limits of
the class, and only recognises the inevitable accident of birth: while
the fear of losing caste is one of the most salutary checks which has
been devised to restrain men from acts unworthy of their social
position.It is an enormous gain to society that each man should know
his station and be prepared to perform the duties belonging to it,
without the restless craving of a selfish ambition that would sacrifice
everything for the sake of the personal aggrandisement of the
individual.It is far better to acknowledge that there is no sphere in
life in which man may not become as like unto the gods as in any other
sphere; and it is everywhere better to respect the public good rather
than to seek to gratify personal ambition.The populations of modern Europe have become so mixed that neither caste
nor any other Aryan institution now exists in its pristine purity; but
in the ratio in which a people is Aryan do they possess an aristocracy
and municipal institutions; and, what is almost of more importance, in
that ratio are the people prepared to respect the gradations of caste in
society, and to sacrifice their individual ambition to the less
brilliant task of doing all the good that is possible in the spheres in
which they have been placed.It is true, and so has been found, that an uncontrolled despotism is a
sharper, a quicker, and a better tool for warlike purposes, or where
national vanity is to be gratified by conquest or the display of power;
but the complicated, and it may be clumsy, institutions of the Aryans,
are far more lasting and more conducive to individual self-respect, and
far more likely to add to the sum of human happiness, and tend more
clearly to the real greatness and moral elevation of mankind, than any
human institution we are yet acquainted with.So far as our experience now goes, the division of human society into
classes or castes is not only the most natural concomitant of the
division of labour, but is also the most beneficent of the institutions
of man; while the organisation of a nation into self-governing
municipalities is not only singularly conducive to individual
well-being, but renders it practically indestructible by conquest, and
even imperishable through lapse of time.These two are the most
essentially characteristic institutions of the Aryans.In morals the Aryans were always monogamic, and with them alone does
woman always assume a perfect equality of position: mistress of her own
actions till marriage; when married, in theory at least, the equal
sharer in the property and in the duties of the household.Were it
possible to carry out these doctrines absolutely in practice, they would
probably be more conducive to human happiness than any of those
enumerated above; but even a tendency towards them is an enormous gain.Their institutions for self-government, enumerated above, have probably
done more to elevate the Aryan race than can well be appreciated.When
every man takes, or may take, his share in governing the
commonwealth—when every man must govern himself, and respect the
independence of his neighbour—men cease to be tools, and become
independent reasoning beings.They are taught self-respect, and with
this comes love of truth—of those qualities which command the respect of
their fellow-men; and they are likewise taught that control of their
passions which renders them averse to war; while the more sober
occupations of life prevent the necessity of their seeking, in the
wildness of excitement, that relief from monotony which so frequently
drives other races into those excesses the world has had so often to
deplore.The existence of caste, even in its most modified form,
prevents individual ambition from having that unlimited career which
among other races has so often sacrificed the public weal to the
ambition of an individual.The Aryan races employed an alphabet at so early a period of their
history that we cannot now tell when or how it was introduced among
them; and it was, even when we first become acquainted with it, a far
more perfect alphabet than that of the Semitic races, though apparently
formed on its basis.It possessed
vowels, and all that was necessary to enunciate sounds with perfect and
absolute precision.In consequence of this, and of the perfect structure
of their language, they were enabled to indulge in philosophical
speculation, to write treatises on grammar and logic, and generally to
assume a literary position which other races never attained to.History with them was not a mere record of dates or collection of
genealogical tables, but an essay on the polity of mankind, to which the
narrative afforded the illustration; while their poetry had always a
tendency to assume more a didactic than a lyric form.It is among the
Aryans that the Epos first rose to eminence and the Drama was elevated
above a mere spectacle; but even in these the highest merit sought to be
attained was that they should represent vividly events which might have
taken place, even if they never did happen among men; while the Celts
and the Semites delight in wild imaginings which never could have
existed except in the brain of the poet.When the blood of the Aryan has
been mixed with that of other races, they have produced a literature
eminently imaginative and poetic; but in proportion to their purity has
been their tendency towards a more prosaic style of composition.The aim
of the race has always been the attainment of practical common sense,
and the possession of this quality is their pride and boast, and justly
so; but it is unfortunately antagonistic to the existence of an
imaginative literature, and we must look to them more for eminence in
works on history and philosophy than in those which require imagination
or creative power.These remarks apply with more than double force to the Fine Arts than to
verbal literature.In the first place a people possessing such a power
of phonetic utterance never could look on a picture or statue as more
than a mere subsidiary illustration of the written text.A painting may
represent vividly one view of what took place at one moment of time, but
a written narrative can deal with all the circumstances and link it to
its antecedents and effects.A statue of a man cannot tell one-tenth of
what a short biography will make plain: and an ideal statue or ideal
painting may be a pretty Celtic plaything, but it is not what Aryans
hanker after.Convenience is the first thing
which the practical common sense of the Aryan seeks, and then to gain
what he desires by the readiest and the easiest means.This done, why
should he do more?If, induced by a desire to emulate others, he has to
make his building ornamental, he is willing to copy what experience has
proved to be successful in former works, willing to spend his money and
to submit to some inconvenience; but in his heart he thinks it useless,
and he neither will waste his time in thinking on the subject, nor apply
those energies of his mind to its elaboration, without which nothing
great or good was ever done in Art.In addition to this, the immaterial nature of their faith has always
deprived the Aryan races of the principal incentive to architectural
magnificence.[20] The Turanian and Celtic races always have the most
implicit faith in ceremonial worship and in the necessity of
architectural splendour as its indispensable accompaniment.On the other
hand, the more practical Aryan can never be brought to understand that
prayer is either more sincere or is more acceptable in one form of house
than in any other.He does not feel that virtue can be increased or vice
exterminated by the number of bricks or stones that may be heaped on one
another, or the form in which they may be placed; nor will his
conception of the Deity admit of supposing that He can be propitiated by
palaces or halls erected in honour of Him, or that a building in the
Middle Pointed Gothic is more acceptable than one in the Classic or any
other style.This want of faith may be reasonable, but it is fatal to poetry in Art,
and, it is feared, will prevent the Aryans from attaining more
excellence in Architectural Art at the present time than they have done
in former ages.It is also true that the people are singularly deficient in their
appreciation of colours.Not that actual colour-blindness is more common
with them than with other races, but the harmony of tints is unknown to
them.Some may learn, but none feel it; it is a matter of memory and an
exercise of intellect, but no more.Other—even
savage—races cannot go wrong in this respect.If the Aryan is successful
in art, it is generally in consequence of education, not from feeling;
and, like all that is not innate in man, it yields only a secondary
gratification, and fails to impress his brother man, or to be a real
work of Art.From these causes the ancient Aryans never erected a single building in
India when they were pure, nor in that part of India which they
colonised even after their blood became mixed; and we do not now know
what their style was or is, though the whole of that part of the
peninsula occupied by the Turanians, or to which their influence ever
extended, is, and always was, covered by buildings, vast in extent and
wonderful from their elaboration.This, probably, also is the true cause
of the decline of Architecture and other arts in Europe and in the rest
of the modern world.Wherever the Aryans appear Art flies before them,
and where their influence extends utilitarian practical common sense is
assumed to be all that man should aim at.It may be so, but it is sad to
think that beauty cannot be combined with sense.Music alone, as being the most phonetic of the fine arts, has received
among the Aryans a degree of culture denied to the others; but even here
the tendency has been rather to develop scientific excellence than to
appeal to the responsive chords of the human heart.Notwithstanding
this, its power is more felt and greater excellence is attained in this
science than in any other.It also has escaped the slovenly process of
copying, with which the unartistic mind of the Aryans has been content
to fancy it was creating Art in other branches.If, however, these races have been so deficient in the fine arts, they
have been as excellent in all the useful ones.Agriculture,
manufactures, commerce, ship-building, and road-making, all that tends
to accumulate wealth or to advance material prosperity, has been
developed to an extent as great as it is unprecedented, and promises to
produce results which as yet can only be dimly guessed at.A great, and,
so far as we can see, an inevitable revolution, is pervading the whole
world through the devotion of the Aryan races to these arts.We have no
reason for supposing it will be otherwise than beneficial, however much
we may feel inclined to regret that the beautiful could not be allowed
to share a little of that worship so lavishly bestowed on the useful.It follows, as a matter of course, that, with minds so constituted, the
Aryans should have cultivated science with earnestness and success.The
only beauty they, in fact, appreciated was the beauty of scientific
truth; the only harmony they ever really felt was that of the laws of
nature; and the only art they ever cared to cultivate was that which
grouped these truths and their harmonies into forms which enabled them
to be easily grasped and appreciated.Mathematics always had especial
charms to the Aryan mind; and, more even than this, astronomy was always
captivating.So, also, were the mechanical, and so, too, the natural
sciences.It is to the Aryans that Induction owes its birth, and they
probably alone have the patience and the sobriety to work it to its
legitimate conclusions.The true mission of the Aryan races appears to be to pervade the world
with the useful and industrial arts, and so tend to reproduce that unity
which has long been lost, to raise man, not by magnifying his individual
cleverness, but by accumulating a knowledge of the works of God, so
tending to make him a greater and wiser, and at the same time a humbler
and a more religious servant of his Creator.When Auguste Comte proposed that classification which made the fortune
of his philosophy,—when he said that all mankind passed through the
theological state in childhood, the metaphysical in youth, and the
philosophical or positive in manhood,—and ventured to extend this
discovery to nations, he had a glimpse, as others have had before him,
of the beauty of the great harmony which pervades all created things.But he had not philosophy enough to see that the one great law is so
vast and so remote, that no human intellect can grasp it, and that it is
only the little fragments of that great scheme which are found
everywhere which man is permitted to understand.Had he known as much of ethnographical as he did of mathematical
science, he would have perceived that there is no warrant for this
daring generalisation; but that nations, in the states which he calls
the theological, the metaphysical, and the philosophical, exist now and
coexisted through all the ages of the world to which our historical
knowledge extends.What the Egyptians were when they first appeared on the scene they were
when they perished under the Greek and Roman sway;—what the Chinese
always were they now are;—the Jews and Arabs are unchanged to this
day;—the Celts are as daringly speculative and as blindly superstitious
now as we always found them;—and the Aryans of the Vedas or of Tacitus
were very much the same sober, reasoning, unimaginative, and unartistic
people as they are at this hour.Progress among men, as among the
animals, seems to be achieved not so much by advances made within the
limits of the group, as by the supercession of the less finely organised
beings by those of a higher class;—and this, so far as our knowledge
extends, is accomplished neither by successive creations, nor by the
gradual development of one species out of another, but by the successive
prominent appearances of previously developed, though partially dormant
creations.Ethnographers have already worked out this problem to a great extent,
and arrived at a very considerable degree of certainty, through the
researches of patient linguistic investigators.But language is in
itself too impalpable ever to give the science that tangible, local
reality which is necessary to its success; and it is here that
Archæology comes so opportunely to its aid.What men dug or built
remains where it was first placed, and probably retains the first
impressions it received: and so fixes the era and standing of those who
called it into existence; so that even those who cannot appreciate the
evidence derived from grammar or from words, may generally see at a
glance what the facts of the case really are.It is even more important that such a science as Ethnology should have
two or more methods of investigation at its command.Certainty can
hardly ever be attained by only one process, unless checked and
elucidated by others, and nothing can therefore be more fortunate than
the possession of so important a sister science as that of Archæology to
aid in the search after scientific truth.If Ethnology may thus be so largely indebted to Archæology, the converse
is also true; and she may pay back the debt with interest.As Archæology
and Architecture have hitherto been studied, they, but more especially
the latter, have been little more than a dry record of facts and
measurements, interesting to the antiquary, to the professional
architect, or to the tourist, who finds it necessary to get up a certain
amount of knowledge on the subject; but the utmost that has hitherto
been sought to be attained is a certain knowledge of the forms of the
art, while the study of it, as that of one of the most important and
most instructive of the sciences connected with the history of man, has
been as a rule neglected.Without this the study of Architecture is a mere record of bricks and
stones, and of the modes in which they were heaped together for man’s
use.Considered in the light of an historical record, it acquires not
only the dignity of a science, but especial interest as being one of
those sciences which are most closely connected with man’s interests and
feelings, and the one which more distinctly expresses and more clearly
records what man did and felt in previous ages, than any other study we
are acquainted with.From this point of view, not only every tomb and every temple, but even
the rude monoliths and mounds of savages, acquire a dignity and interest
to which they have otherwise no title; and man’s works become not only
man’s most imperishable record, but one of the best means we possess of
studying his history, or of understanding his nature or his aspirations.Rightly understood, Archæology is as useful as any other branch of
science or of art, in enabling us to catch such glimpses as are
vouchsafed to man of the great laws that govern all things; and the
knowledge that this class of man’s works is guided and governed by those
very laws, and not by the chance efforts of unmeaning minds, elevates
the study of it to as high a position as that of any other branch of
human knowledge.PART I.—ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE.So long as the geographer confines himself to mapping out the different
countries of the world, or smaller portions of the earth’s surface, he
finds no difficulty in making a projection which shall correctly
represent the exact relative position of all the various features of the
land or sea.But when he attempts to portray a continent, some
distortion necessarily results; and when he undertakes a hemisphere,
both distortion and exaggeration become inevitable.It has consequently
been found necessary to resort to some conventional means of portraying
the larger surfaces of the globe.These avowedly do not represent
correctly the forms of the countries portrayed, but they enable the
geographer to ascertain what their distances or relative positions are
by the application of certain rules and formulæ of no great complexity.So long as the narrative is confined
to individual countries or provinces, it may be perfectly consecutive
and uninterrupted; but when two or three nations are grouped together,
frequent interruptions and recapitulations become necessary; and when
universal history is attempted, it seems impossible to arrange the
narrative so as to prevent these from assuming very considerable
importance.The utmost that can be done is to devise some scheme which
shall prevent the repetition from leading to tediousness, and enable the
student to follow the thread of any portion of the narrative without
confusion or the assumption of any special previous knowledge on his
part.Bearing these difficulties in mind, it will probably be found convenient
to divide the whole history of Architecture into four great divisions or
parts.The first, which may be called “Ancient or Heathen Art,” to comprehend
all those styles which prevailed in the old world from the dawn of
history in Egypt till the disruption of the Roman Empire by the removal
of the capital from Rome to Constantinople in the 4th century.The second to be called either “Mediæval,” or more properly “Christian
Art.” This again subdivides itself into three easily-understood
divisions.The
Romanesque or transitional style which prevailed between the Roman and
the Gothic styles; and 3.The
Byzantine style comes first because its development was so rapid that
already in the 6th century it had reached its culminating period, and
throughout the Middle Ages it exercised considerable influence in
various parts of Italy and France; an influence the extent of which it
is only possible to follow after its study.It is difficult, for
instance, to understand the churches in Ravenna or St.Mark’s in Venice,
or the churches at Périgueux, and in the Charente, until the churches of
Sta.Sergius, Constantinople, and of St.Demetrius,
Thessalonica, have been studied; and although it is advisable when
describing the style to carry it through its later developments in
Greece, in Russia, and in the East, these variations and developments
are not of a nature to distract the reader or cause him to lose sight of
the leading characteristics of the style.There is some difficulty in
knowing where to draw the line between the Romanesque and the Gothic
style; as generally accepted now, the term Romanesque includes all the
round-arched Gothic styles, and although many of the leading principles
of Gothic work are to be found entering into buildings constructed prior
to the introduction of the pointed arch into transverse and diagonal
ribbed arch vaulting, it was this latter which led to the great
development of the Gothic style in France, England, and elsewhere in the
12th and 13th centuries.The third great division of the subject I would suggest might
conveniently be denominated “Pagan.”[21] It would comprise all those
minor miscellaneous styles not included in the two previous divisions.Commencing with the Saracenic, it would include the Buddhist, Hindu, and
Chinese styles, the Mexican and Peruvian, and lastly that mysterious
group which for want of a better name I have elsewhere designated as
“Rude Stone Monuments.”[22] No very consecutive arrangement can be
formed for these styles.They generally have little connection with each
other, and are so much less important than the others that their mode of
treatment is of far less consequence.Nor is it necessary to attempt any
exact classification of these at present, as, owing to the convenience
of publication, it has been determined to form the Indian and allied
Eastern styles into a separate volume, which will include not only the
Buddhist and Hindu styles, but the Indian Saracenic, which, in a
strictly logical arrangement, ought to be classified with the western
style bearing the same name.The styles of the New world, having as yet no acknowledged connection
with those of the Old, may be for the present treated of anywhere.The fourth and last great division, forming the fourth volume of the
present work, is that of the “Modern or Copying Styles of Architecture,”
meaning thereby those which are the products of the renaissance of the
classical styles that marked the epoch of the cinquecento period.These
have since that time prevailed generally in Europe to the present day,
and are now making the tour of the world.Within the limits of the
present century it is true that the copying of the classical styles to
some extent were superseded by a more servile imitation of those of
mediæval art.The forms consequently changed, but the principles
remained the same.It would of course be easy to point out minor objections to this or to
any scheme, but on the whole it will be found to meet the exigencies of
the case as we now know it, as well or perhaps better than any other.The greatest difficulty in carrying it out is to ascertain how far the
geographical arrangement should be made to supersede the chronological
and ethnographical.Whether, for instance, Italy should be considered as
a whole, or if the buildings of the eastern coast should not be
described as belonging to the Byzantine, and those of the western coast
to the Gothic kingdom?Whether the description of the Temple at
Jerusalem should stop short with the rebuilding by Zorobabel, or be
continued till its final completion under Herod?If the former course is
pursued, we cut in two a perfectly consecutive narrative; if the latter,
we get far in advance of our chronological sequence.In both of these instances, as in many others, it is a choice of
difficulties, and where frequently the least strictly logical mode of
proceeding may be found the most convenient.After all, the real difficulty lies not so much in arranging the
materials as in weighing the relative importance to be assigned to each
division.In wandering over so vast a field it is difficult to prevent
personal predilection from interfering with purely logical criticism.Although architecture is the most mechanical of the fine arts, and
consequently the most amenable to scientific treatment, still as a fine
art it must be felt to be appreciated, and when the feelings come into
play the reason is sometimes in danger.Though strict impartiality has
been aimed at in assigning the true limits to each of the divisions
above pointed out, few probably will be of the same opinion as to the
degree of success which has been achieved in the attempt.OUTLINE OF EGYPTIAN CHRONOLOGY.ACCORDING TO MANETHO AND THE MONUMENTS.OLD KINGDOM OF PYRAMID BUILDERS.1st dynasty Thinite        252    Accession of Menes, 1st king.3906

                                BOOK I.

                         EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.In any consecutive narrative of the architectural undertakings of
mankind the description of what was done in Egypt necessarily commences
the series, not only because the records of authentic history are found
in the Valley of the Nile long before the traditions of other nations
had assumed anything like tangible consistency, but because, from the
earliest dawn down to the time when Christianity struck down the old
idolatry, the inhabitants of that mysterious land were essentially and
pre-eminently a building race.Were it not for this we should be left
with the dry bones of the skeleton of her history, which is all that is
left us of the dynasties of Manetho; or with the fables in which
ignorant and credulous European travellers expressed their wonder at a
civilisation they could not comprehend.As the case now stands, the monuments of Egypt give life and reality to
their whole history.It is impossible for any educated man capable of
judging of the value of evidence to wander among the Pyramids and tombs
of Memphis, the Temples of Thebes, or the vast structures erected by the
Ptolemys or Cæsars, and not to feel that he has before him a chapter of
history more authentic than we possess of any nation at all approaching
it in antiquity, and a picture of men and manners more vivid and more
ample than remains to us of any other people who have passed away.As we wander among the tombs or temples of Egypt we see the very
chisel-marks of the mason, and the actual colours of the painter which
were ordered by a Khufu, or a Rameses, and we stand face to face with
works the progress of which they watched, and which they designed in
order to convey to posterity what their thoughts and feelings were, and
what they desired to record for the instruction of future generations.All is there now, and all who care may learn what these old kings
intended should be known by their remotest posterity.Immense progress has been made in unravelling the intricacies of
Egyptian history since the time when Champollion, profiting by the
discovery of Young, first translated the hieroglyphical inscriptions
that cover the walls of Egyptian buildings.Of late years it has been
too frequently assumed that his works, with those of Rosellini, of
Wilkinson, and Lepsius, and the numerous other authors who have applied
themselves to Egyptology, had told us all we are ever likely to know of
her history.In so far as the epochs of the great Pharaonic dynasties of
Thebes are concerned this may be partially true, but it is only since M.
Mariette undertook the systematic exploration of the great Necropolis of
Memphis that we have been enabled to realise the importance of the older
dynasties, and become aware of the completeness of the records they have
left behind them.Much as we have learned during the last fifty years,
the recent explorations of Maspero, W. M. Flinders Petrie and others
have taught us that the soil of Egypt is not half exhausted yet; and
every day our knowledge is assuming a consistency and completeness as
satisfactory as it is wonderful.Although there are still minor differences of opinion with regard to the
details of Egyptian chronology, still the divergences between the
various systems proposed are gradually narrowing in extent.The sequence
of events is certain, and accepted by all.The initial date, and the
adjustments depending on it, are alone in dispute.The truth is that
every subsequent step in the investigation has tended more and more to
prove the correctness of the data furnished by the lists of Manetho, and
the only important question is, “what is Manetho?” His work is lost.The
only real extracts we have from the original are those in ‘Josephus
contra Apion.’ The lists in Eusebius and Syncellus or Africanus have
avowedly been adjusted to suit preconceived theories of Biblical
chronology; but on the whole a great preponderance of evidence seems in
favour of assuming that he really intended to fix the year 3906 as the
initial year of the reign of Menes,[24] or some year within a very short
distance of that date.Some years ago this would have seemed to suffice,
but so many new monuments have been disinterred of late, so many new
names of kings added to our lists, that the tendency is now rather to
extend than to contract this limit of duration.Be this as it may, what we really do know absolutely is that there was
an old kingdom of pyramid-builders, comprising the first ten dynasties
of Manetho, who reigned at Memphis.These, after a period of decadence,
were superseded by kings of a different race coming from the south; and
that these, after a short period of glory, were conquered by an Asiatic
race of hated Shepherd kings.After five centuries of foreign domination, the Shepherds in their turn
were driven out, and the new kingdom founded.This, after witnessing the
glories of the 18th and 19th dynasties, declined during the next seven
dynasties till they were struck down by the Persian Cambyses.A third period of architectural magnificence arose with the Ptolemys,
and was continued by the Cæsars on nearly the same scale of magnificence
as the second kingdom; but wanting its exuberant nationality, and far
below the quiet grandeur of the earlier epoch.In counting backwards the dates of these dynasties, the first authentic
synchronism we meet with is that of Shishak, the first king of the 22nd
dynasty, contemporary with Rehoboam, about 970 B.C.The next is the Exode of the Jews, which took place 1312 B.C., under the
reign of Meneptah II., the fourth king of the 19th dynasty of Manetho.Many would place it earlier, but none probably would bring that event
down to a more modern date.From this date Josephus tells us that Manetho counted 518 years to the
expulsion of the Shepherds, and 511 for the duration of their sojourn in
Egypt,[25] we thus get back to 2340 for the first year of Salatis.There
then remain only fifteen centuries and a half, in which we have to
arrange the two great Theban dynasties (the 11th and 12th), which
reigned for more than two centuries over the whole of Egypt; while the
12th seems to have extended some distance into the period occupied by
the Shepherds.We are thus left with little more than 1300 years over
which to spread the ten first dynasties, notwithstanding that some 60 or
70 of their royal sepulchral pyramids still adorn the banks of the Nile;
and we have many names to which no tombs can be attached, and many
pyramids may have perished during the 5000 years which have elapsed
since the greater number of them were erected.Long as these periods may to some appear, they are certainly the
shortest that any one familiar with the recent progress of Egyptian
research would be willing to assign to them.But in whatever light they
may be viewed, they sink into utter insignificance when compared with
the periods that must have elapsed before Egypt could have reached that
stage of civilisation in which we find her when her existence first
dawns upon us.If one point in Egyptian history is proved with more
certainty than another, it is that the great Pyramids of Gizeh were
erected by the kings of the 4th dynasty: and it seems impossible to find
room for the now ascertained facts of Egyptian chronology, unless we
place their erection between 3000 and 3500 years before the Christian
era.No one can possibly examine the interior of the Great Pyramid without
being struck with astonishment at the wonderful mechanical skill
displayed in its construction.The immense blocks of granite brought
from Syene—a distance of 500 miles—polished like glass, and so fitted
that the joints can hardly be detected.Nothing can be more wonderful
than the extraordinary amount of knowledge displayed in the construction
of the discharging chambers over the roof of the principal apartment, in
the alignment of the sloping galleries, in the provision of ventilating
shafts, and in all the wonderful contrivances of the structure.All
these, too, are carried out with such precision, that, notwithstanding
the immense superincumbent weight, no settlement in any part can be
detected to the extent of an appreciable fraction of an inch.Nothing
more perfect, mechanically, has ever been erected since that time; and
we ask ourselves in vain, how long it must have taken before men
acquired such experience and such skill, or were so perfectly organised,
as to contemplate and complete such undertakings.Around the base of the pyramid are found numerous structural tombs,
whose walls bear the cartouche of the same king—Khufu—whose name was
found by Colonel Howard Vyse in one of the previously unopened chambers
of the Great Pyramid.[26] These are adorned with paintings so numerous
and so complete, as to enable us to realise with singular completeness
the state of Egyptian society at that early period.On their walls the owner of the tomb is usually represented seated,
offering first fruits on a simple table-altar to an unseen god.He is
generally accompanied by his wife, and surrounded by his stewards and
servants, who enumerate his wealth in horned cattle, in asses, in sheep
and goats, in geese and ducks.In other pictures some are ploughing and
sowing, some reaping or thrashing out the corn, while others are tending
his tame monkeys or cranes, and other domesticated pets.Music and
dancing add to the circle of domestic enjoyments, and fowling and
fishing occupy his days of leisure.No sign of soldiers or of warlike
strife appears in any of these pictures; no arms, no chariots or horses.Everything there represented speaks of
peace at home and abroad,[27] of agricultural wealth and consequent
content.In all these pictures the men are represented with an ethnic
and artistic truth that enables us easily to recognise their race and
station.The animals are not only easily distinguishable, but the
characteristic peculiarities of each species are seized with a power of
generalisation seldom if ever surpassed; and the hieroglyphic system
which forms the legend and explains the whole, was as complete and
perfect then as at any future period.More striking than even the paintings are the portrait-statues which
have recently been discovered in the secret recesses of these tombs;
nothing more wonderfully truthful and realistic has been done since that
time, till the invention of photography, and even that can hardly
represent a man with such unflattering truthfulness as these old
 terra-cotta portraits of the sleek rich men of the pyramid
period.Wonderful as all this maturity of art may be when found at so early a
period, the problem becomes still more perplexing when we again ask
ourselves how long a people must have lived and recorded their
experience before they came to realise and aspire to an eternity such as
the building of these pyramids shows that they sacrificed everything to
attain.One of their great aims was to preserve the body intact for 3000
years, in order that the soul might again be united with it when the day
of judgment arrived.But what taught them to contemplate such periods of
time with confidence, and, stranger still, how did they learn to realise
so daring an aspiration?Nor is our wonder less when we ask ourselves how it happened that such a
people became so thoroughly organised at that early age as to be willing
to undertake the greatest architectural works the world has since seen
in honour of one man from among themselves?A king without an army, and
with no claim, so far as we can see, to such an honour beyond the common
consent of all, which could hardly have been obtained except by the
title of long inherited services acknowledged by the community at large.It would be difficult to find any other example which so fully
illustrates the value of architecture as a mode of writing history as
this.It is possible there may have been nations as old and as early
civilised as the Egyptians: but they were not builders, and their memory
is lost.It is to their architecture alone that we owe the preservation
of what we know of this old people.And it is the knowledge so obtained
that adds such interest to the study of their art.In the present state of our knowledge it may seem an idle speculation to
suggest that the Egyptian and Chinese are two fragments of one great
primordial race, widely separated now by the irruption of other Turanian
and Aryan races between them; but this at least is certain, that in
manners and customs, in arts and polity, in religion and civilisation,
these two peoples more closely resemble one another than any other two
nations which have existed since, even when avowedly of similar race and
living in proximity to one another.At the earliest period at which Chinese history opens upon us, we find
the same amount of civilisation maintaining itself utterly
unprogressively to the present day.The same peaceful industry and
agricultural wealth accompanied by the same outwardly pleasing domestic
relations and apparent content.The same want of power to assimilate with surrounding nations.Both
hating war, but reverencing their kings, and counting their chronology
by dynasties exactly as the Egyptians have always done.Their religions
seem wonderfully alike, and both are characterised by the same
fearlessness of death, and the same calm enjoyment in the contemplation
of its advent.[28]

In fact there is no peculiarity in the old kingdom of Egypt that has not
its counterpart in China at the present day, though more or less
modified, perhaps, by local circumstances; and there is nothing in the
older system which we cannot understand by using proper illustrations,
derived from what we see passing under our immediate observation in the
far East.The great lesson we learn from the study of the history of
China as bearing on that of Egypt is, that all idea of the impossibility
of the recorded events in the latter country is taken away by reference
to the other.Neither the duration of the Egyptian dynasties, nor the
early perfection of her civilisation, or its strange persistency, can be
objected to as improbable.What we know has happened in Asia in modern
times may certainly have taken place in Africa, though at an earlier
period.THE PYRAMIDS AND CONTEMPORARY MONUMENTS.Leaving these speculations to be developed more fully in the sequel, let
us now turn to the pyramids—the oldest, largest, and most mysterious of
all the monuments of man’s art now existing.All those in Egypt are
situated on the left bank of the Nile, just beyond the cultivated
ground, and on the edge of the desert, and all the principal examples
within what may fairly be called the Necropolis of Memphis.Sixty or
seventy of these have been discovered and explored, all which appear to
be royal sepulchres.This alone, if true would suffice to justify us in
assigning a duration of 1000 years at least to the dynasties of the
pyramid builders, and this is about the date we acquire from other
sources.The three great pyramids of Gizeh are the most remarkable and the best
known of all those of Egypt.Of these the first, erected by Cheops, or,
as he is now more correctly named, Khufu, is the largest; but the next,
by Chephren (Khafra), his successor, is scarcely inferior in dimensions;
the third, that of Mycerinus (Menkaura), is very much smaller, but
excelled the two others in this, that it had a coating of beautiful red
granite from Syene, while the other two were revêted only with the
beautiful limestone of the country.Part of this coating still remains
near the top of the second; and Colonel Vyse[29] was fortunate enough to
discover some of the coping-stones of the Great Pyramid buried in the
rubbish at its base.These are sufficient to indicate the nature and
extent of the whole, and to show that it was commenced from the bottom
and carried upwards; not at the top, as it has sometimes been
thoughtlessly asserted.[30]

[Illustration: No.Since Colonel Vyse’s discovery, however, further casing-stones have been
found in situ by Mr.Flinders Petrie, whose measurements, taken in
1880-82, and published in the following year,[31] are the most accurate
yet made.The dimensions hitherto given have shown a difference of as
much as eighteen inches in the length of the sides, which, if the
pyramid had been set out on a perfectly clear level ground, would have
detracted from the perfection which has been claimed for its setting
out.This difference, however, it appears now, was due to the fact that
the various observers had measured from angle to angle of the corner
sockets, and had “assumed that the faces of the stones placed in them
rose up vertically from the edge of the bottom until they reached the
pavement (whatever level that might be), from which the sloping face
started upwards.” This, however, was not the case; the sloping sides of
the Pyramid continued down to the rock surface, and the base was
eventually partially covered over by a level pavement or platform;[32]
the parts covered over varying in extent according to the depth they
were carried down.Petrie utilized the angle sockets for the purpose
of obtaining the true diagonals of the casing, and having computed a
square which passed through the points of casing found on each side, and
having also its corners lying on the diagonals of the sockets, obtained
the dimensions of the original base of the Great Pyramid casing on the
artificial platform or pavement, which was as follows:—

                                Sq.North side  9069·4 or 755 9·4
                     East side   9067·7 or 755 7·7
                     South side  9069·5 or 755 8·6
                     West side   9068·6 or 755 8·8

The mean being 755 ft.8·8 in., and the extreme difference being 1·7 of
an inch only.The actual height of the Great Pyramid from level of platform was 481
ft.4 in., and the angle of casing 51° 52ʺ.In the Second Pyramid, the bottom corner of casing (which was in
granite) had a vertical base 10 or 12 in.high, against which the
pavement was laid; and the following were the dimensions obtained:—

                                Sq.North side  8471·9 or 705 11·9
                     East side   8475·2 or 706 3·2
                     South side  8476·9 or 706 4·9
                     West side   8475·5 or 706 3·5

The mean being 706 ft.2·9 in., and the extreme difference in the length
of side 5 in.The height was 472 ft., and the angle of casing 53° 10ʹ.The Third Pyramid was never quite finished, and there is some difficulty
in determining the exact level of platform.The mean length of the sides
was calculated by Mr.1·6 in., its height 215 ft., and
the angle of its casing 51° 10ʹ.From this it will be seen that the area of the Great Pyramid (more than
13 acres) is more than twice the extent of that of St.Peter’s at Rome,
or of any other building in the world.[33] Its height is equal to the
highest spire of any cathedral in Europe; for, though it has been
attempted to erect higher buildings, in no instance has this yet been
successfully achieved.Even the Third Pyramid covers more ground than
any Gothic cathedral, and the mass of materials it contains far
surpasses that of any erection we possess in Europe.All the pyramids (with one exception) face exactly north, and have their
entrance on that side—a circumstance the more remarkable, as the later
builders of Thebes appear to have had no notion of orientation, but to
have placed their buildings and tombs so as to avoid regularity, and
facing in every conceivable direction.Instead of the entrances to the
pyramids being level, they all <DW72> downwards—generally at angles of
about 26° to the horizon—a circumstance which has led to an infinity of
speculation, as to whether they were not observatories, and meant for
the observation of the pole-star, &c.[34] All these theories, however,
have failed, for a variety of reasons it is needless now to discuss; but
among others it may be mentioned that the angles are not the same in any
two pyramids, though erected within a few years of one another, and in
the twenty which were measured by Colonel Vyse they vary from 22° 35ʹ to
34° 5ʹ.The angle of the inclination of the side of the pyramid to the
horizon is more constant, varying only from 51° 10ʹ to 52° 32ʹ, and in
the Gizeh pyramid it would appear that the angle of the passage was
intended to have been about one-half of this.Petrie gives a synopsis of the various theories connected with the
Great Pyramid, which applies not only to the outside form but to the
several chambers and passages in the interior.“There are three great
lines of theory,” he says,[35] “throughout the Pyramid, each of which
must stand or fall as a whole, they are scarcely contradictory, and may
almost subsist together;” these are (1) the Egyptian cubit (20·62 in.)theory; (2) the π proportion or radius and circumference theory; (3) the
theory of areas, squares of lengths and diagonals.Of the two first, and applying these only to the exterior by the cubit
theory, the outside form of pyramid is 280 cubits high and 440 cubits
length of side, or 7 in height to 11 of width.This is confirmed by the
π theory, where we get the very common proportion that the height is to
the circumference as the radius is to the circumference of a circle
inscribed within its base; thus taking the mean height of 481 ft.4 in.,
we have 481·33 × 2 × 3·1416 = 3024, whilst the side 755·75 × 4 = 3023,
so near a coincidence that it can hardly be accidental, and if it was
intended, all the other external proportions follow as a matter of
course.Even if this theory should not be accepted as the true one, it has at
least the merit of being nearer the truth than any other yet proposed.I
confess it appears to me so likely that I would hardly care to go
further, especially as all the astronomical theories have signally
failed, and it seems as if it were only to some numerical fancy that we
must look for a solution of the puzzle.Be this as it may, the small residuum we get from all these pyramid
discussions is, that they were built by the kings of the early dynasties
of the old kingdom of Egypt as their tombs.The leading idea that
governed their forms was that of durability—a quasi-eternity of duration
is what they aimed at.The entrances were meant to be concealed, and the
angle of the passages was the limit of rest at which heavy bodies could
be moved while obtaining the necessary strength where they opened at the
outside, and the necessary difficulty for protection inside, without
trenching on impossibility.By concealment of the entrance, the
difficulties of the passages, and the complicated but most ingenious
arrangement of portcullises, these ancient kings hoped to be allowed to
rest in undisturbed security for at least 3000 years.Perhaps they were
successful, though their tombs have since been so shamefully profaned.To the principal dimensions of the Great Pyramid given above, it may be
added that the entrance is 55 ft.above the base, on the 19th
course, which is deeper than the 11 to 14 courses above and below; at
present there remain 203 courses, to which must be added 12 to 14
missing.6 in., but they diminish
in height—generally speaking, but not uniformly—towards the top.The
summit now consists of a platform 32 ft.is wanting, the present actual height being 454 ft.It contains two
chambers above-ground, and one cut in the rock at a considerable depth
below the foundations.The passages and chambers are worthy of the mass; all are lined with
polished granite; and the ingenuity and pains that have been taken to
render them solid and secure, and to prevent their being crushed by the
superincumbent mass, raise our idea of Egyptian science higher than even
the bulk of the building itself could do.Section of King’s Chamber and of Passage in
  Great Pyramid.Towards the exterior, where the pressure is not great, the roof is flat,
though it is probable that even there the weight is throughout
discharged by 2 stones, sloping up at a certain angle to where they
meet, as at the entrance.Towards the centre of the pyramid, however,
the passage becomes 28 feet high, the 7 upper courses of stone
overhanging one another as shown in the annexed section (fig.1), so as
to reduce the bearing of the covering stone.Nowhere, however, is this
ingenuity more shown than in the royal chamber, which measures 17 ft.The walls are lined and the
roof is formed of splendid slabs of Syenite, but above the roof 4
successive chambers, as shown in the annexed section (fig.2), have been
formed, each divided from the other by slabs of granite, polished on
their lower surfaces, but left rough on the upper, and above these a 5th
chamber is formed of 2 sloping blocks to discharge the weight of the
whole.The first of these chambers has long been known; the upper four
were discovered and first entered by Colonel Vyse, and it was in one of
these that he discovered the name of the founder.This was not engraved
as a record, but scribbled in red paint on the stones, apparently as a
quarrymark, or as an address to the king, and accompanied by something
like directions for their position in the building.The interest that
attaches to these inscriptions consists in the certainty of their being
contemporary records, in their proving that Khufu was the founder of the
Great Pyramid, and consequently fixing its relative date beyond all
possibility of cavil.This is the only really virgin discovery in the
pyramids, as they have all been opened either in the time of the Greeks
or Romans, or by the Mahometans, and an unrifled tomb of this age is
still a desideratum.Until such is hit upon we must remain in ignorance
of the real mode of sepulture in those days, and of the purpose of many
of the arrangements in these mysterious buildings.The portcullises which invariably close the entrances of the sepulchral
chamber in the pyramids are among the most curious and ingenious of the
arrangements of these buildings.Generally they consist of great cubical
masses of granite, measuring 8 or 10 ft.each way, and consequently
weighing 50 or 60 tons, and even more.These were fitted into chambers
prepared during the construction of the building, but raised into the
upper parts, and, being lowered after the body was deposited, closed the
entrance so effectually that in some instances it has been found
necessary either to break them in pieces, or to cut a passage round
them, to gain admission to the chambers.They generally slide in grooves
in the wall, to which they fit exactly, and altogether show a degree of
ingenuity and forethought very remarkable, considering the early age at
which they were executed.In the Second Pyramid one chamber has been discovered partly
above-ground, partly cut in the rock.In the Third the chambers are
numerous, all excavated in the rock; and from the tunnels that have been
driven by explorers through the superstructures of these two, it is very
doubtful whether anything is to be found above-ground.[36]

All the old pyramids do not follow the simple outline of those at Gizeh.That at Dahshur, for instance, rises to half the height, with a <DW72> of
54° to the horizon, but is finished at the angle of 45°, giving it a
very exceptional appearance.The pyramids of Sakkara and Medum are of
the class known as mastaba pyramids, the term mastaba (Arabic for bench)
being given to the sloping-sided tombs of about 76° angle and from 10 to
20 ft.(From Colonel Vyse’s work.)The annexed plan and section of Sakkara (Woodcut Nos.9 and 10), both to
the scale of 100 ft.to 1 in., show the peculiar nature of their
construction, which seems to have been cumulative; that is to say, they
have been enlarged in successive periods, the original casing of the
earlier portions having been traced.Petrie says: “Both of these
structures have been several times finished, each time with a
close-jointed polished casing of the finest white limestone, and then,
after each completion, it has been again enlarged by another coat of
rough masonry and another line casing outside.”

These two pyramids are the only two genuine stepped pyramids, all the
others having had an uniform casing on one <DW72> (excepting Dahshur, as
above mentioned).The Pyramid of Sakkara is the only pyramid that does
not face exactly north and south.It is nearly of the same general
dimensions as the Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus; but its outline, the
disposition of its chambers, and the hieroglyphics found in its
interior, all would seem to point it out as an imitation of the older
form of mausolea by some king of a far more modern date.Flinders Petrie’s discoveries in 1891 determined the age and the
construction of the Pyramid of Medum,[37] erected by Seneferu, a king of
the third dynasty, being therefore the oldest pyramid known.Its
construction resembles that of the small pyramid of Rikheh and the
oblong step pyramid of Sakkara, that is to say, it is a cumulative
mastaba, the primal mastaba being about 150 ft.square, and from 37 to
45 ft.The outer coatings added were seven in number, and the
original mass was carried up and heightened as the circuit was
increased, and lastly an outer casing covered over all the steps which
had resulted during the construction.The average length of the base was
473 ft.6 in., the total height being 301 ft.Petrie, the Pyramid of Medum, as those of Sakkara and Rikheh, were of a
transitional form, in which the original mastaba had been greatly
enlarged and subsequently covered over with a casing of pyramidal
outline.“That type once arrived at, there was no need for subsequent
kings to retain the mastaba form internally, and Khufu and his
successors laid out their pyramids of full size at first and built them
up at an angle of 51°, and not at 75°, that which is found in the
ordinary mastabas.” Mr.Petrie also discovered the temple of the pyramid
in the middle of its east side, and almost uninjured.It consisted of a
passage entered at the south end of east front, then a small chamber and
a courtyard adjoining the side of the pyramid, containing two steles and
one altar between them.In the sepulchral pit of Rahotep, near the pyramid, Mr.Petrie found two
arches thrown across a passage to relieve the thrust of the overlapping
sides, which carries the use of that feature back to the 4th dynasty.Around the Pyramids from Abouraash, north of Gizeh to Medum, south of
Sakkara, a distance of over 15 miles, forming the Necropolis of Memphis,
numberless smaller sepulchres are found, which appear to have been
appropriated to private individuals, as the pyramids were—so far as we
can ascertain—reserved for kings, or, at all events, for persons of
royal blood.These tombs are now known under the term of mastabas, to
which we have already referred.The mastaba is a rectangular building
varying in size from 15 to 150 ft.in width and length, and from 10 to
80 ft.Their general form is that of a truncated pyramid with
an angle of 75° to the horizon, low, and looking exceedingly like a
house with sloping walls, with only one door leading to the interior,
though they may contain several apartments, and no attempt is made to
conceal the entrance.The chambers consist (1) of reception rooms and
(2) of serdabs, which are closed cells containing the terra-cotta
statuettes which represent the Ka’s or doubles of the deceased.These
chambers occupy a part only of the mastaba, the remainder being solid
masonry or brickwork.The body seems to have been hidden from
profanation by being hid in a pit sunk in the rock, the entrance to
which was concealed, and could be approached only through the solid core
of the mastaba.Unlike the pyramids, the walls are covered with the paintings above
alluded to, and everything in this “eternal dwelling”[38] of the dead is
made to resemble the abodes of the living; as was afterwards the case
with the Etruscans.It is owing to this circumstance that we are able
not only to realise so perfectly the civil life of the Egyptians at this
period, but to fix the dates of the whole series by identifying the
names of the kings who built the pyramids with those on the walls of the
tombs that surround them.[39]

Like all early architecture, that of these tombs shows evident symptoms
of having been borrowed from a wooden original.The lintels of the
doorways are generally rounded, and the walls mere square posts, grooved
and jointed together, every part of it being as unlike a stone
architecture as can possibly be conceived.Yet the pyramids themselves,
and those tombs which are found outside them, are generally far removed
from the forms employed in timber structures; and it is only when we
find the Egyptians indulging in decorative art that we trace this more
primitive style.There are two doorways of this class in the British
Museum and many in that of Berlin.One engraved in Lepsius’s work
(Woodcut No.11) gives a fair idea of this style of decorative art, in
the most elaborate form in which we now know it.It is possible that
some of its forms may have been derived from brick architecture, but the
lintel certainly was of wood, and so it may be suspected were the
majority of its features.It certainly is a transitional form, and
though we only find it in stone, none of its peculiarities were derived
from lithic arts.Perhaps one of the best illustrations of the
architectural forms of that day was the sarcophagus of Mycerinus,
unfortunately lost on its way to England.It represented a palace, with
all the peculiarities found on a larger scale in the buildings which
surround the pyramid, and with that peculiar cornice and still more
singular roll or ligature on the angles, most evidently a carpentry
form, but which the style retained to its latest day.Doorway in Tomb at the Pyramids.Sarcophagus of Mycerinus, found in Third Pyramid.]In many of these tombs square piers are found supporting the roofs
sometimes, but rarely, with an abacus, and generally without any carved
work, though it is more than probable they were originally painted with
some device, upon which they depended for their ornament.In most
instances they look more like fragments of a wall, of which the
intervening spaces had been cut away, than pillars in the sense in which
we usually understand the word; and in every case in the early ages they
must be looked upon more as utilitarian expedients than as parts of an
ornamental style of architecture.Till recently no temples had been discovered which could with certainty
be ascribed to the age of the pyramid builders; one, however, was
excavated in 1853, from the sand close beside the great Sphinx, with
which it was thought at one time to have been connected.Petrie,
however, found the remains of a causeway 15 ft.wide and over a quarter
of a mile long, leading to a second temple in front of the pyramid of
Khafra; as also the traces of other temples in front of the Great
Pyramid and of that of Menkaura.Further temples have been discovered at
Abouseer, Dahshur and other pyramids, so that, as Mr.209, “to understand the purpose of the erection of the Pyramids it
should be observed that each has a temple on the eastern side of it.Of
the temples of the second and third Pyramids the ruins still remain; and
of the temple of the Great Pyramid the basalt pavement and numerous
blocks of granite show its site.” “The worship of the deified king was
carried on in the temple, looking toward the Pyramid which stood on the
west of it; just as private individuals worshipped their ancestors in
the family tombs” (already referred to) “looking towards the false
doors[40] which are placed in the west side of the tomb, and which
represent the entrances to the hidden sepulchres.”

[Illustration: 13.The temple of the Sphinx,[41] (or, as it is now called, the granite
temple,) though at present almost buried, was apparently a free-standing
building, a mass of masonry, the outer surfaces of which were built in
limestone, and carved with long grooves, horizontal and vertical,
skilfully crossed, resembling therefore the carved fronts of many tombs
at Sakkara and Gizeh and the sarcophagus of Mycerinus (Woodcut No.in each direction, and the walls were 40 ft.It was arranged in two storeys, the upper one being an open court.In the lower storey were: A, a hall 55 ft.high, with two rows of massive granite piers supporting beams
of the same material to carry the stone roof: B, a second hall into
which the first hall opened, and at right angles to it, measuring 81 ft.high, with one row of granite piers down
the centre; both of these being lighted by narrow slits just below the
granite roof:[42] C, a side chamber with six loculi, in two levels, each
19 ft.long: D, a sloping passage lined with granite and oriental
alabaster, leading to the causeway which placed it in communication with
the Second Pyramid, and: E, a hall 60 ft.high (rising therefore above the pavement of the upper court), with a
large recess at each end containing a statue.These recesses were high
above doors which led to smaller chambers also containing statues.The internal walls were lined with immense blocks of granite from Syene
and of alabaster beautifully polished, but with sloping joints and
uneven beds, a form of masonry not unknown in that age.No sculpture or
inscription of any sort is found on the walls of the temple,[43] or
ornament or symbol in the sanctuary.Statues and tablets of Khafra, the
builder of the Second Pyramid, were found in the well, and this, and the
fact that the causeway extended to the temple in front of his pyramid,
shows clearly that it belonged to his time.[44]


In the present transitional state of our knowledge of the architectural
art of the pyramid builders, it is difficult to form any distinct
judgment as to its merits.The early Egyptians built neither for beauty
nor for use, but for eternity, and to this last they sacrificed every
other feeling.In itself nothing can be less artistic than a pyramid.A
tower, either round or square, or of any other form, and of the same
dimensions, would have been far more imposing, and if of sufficient
height—the mass being the same—might almost have attained sublimity; but
a pyramid never looks so large as it is, and not till you almost touch
it can you realise its vast dimensions.This is owing principally to all
its parts sloping away from the eye instead of boldly challenging
observation; but, on the other hand, no form is so stable, none so
capable of resisting the injuries of time or force, and none,
consequently, so well calculated to attain the object for which the
pyramids were erected.As examples of technic art, they are unrivalled
among the works of men, but they rank low if judged by the æsthetic
rules of architectural art.The same may be said of the tombs around them: they are low and solid,
but possess neither beauty of form nor any architectural feature worthy
of attention or admiration, but they have lasted nearly uninjured from
the remotest antiquity, and thus have attained the object their builders
had principally in view in designing them.Their temple architecture, on the other hand, may induce us to modify
considerably these opinions.The one described above—which is the only
one I personally have any knowledge of—is perhaps the simplest and least
adorned temple in the world.All its parts are plain—straight and
square, without a single moulding of any sort, but they are perfectly
proportioned to the work they have to do.They are pleasingly and
effectively arranged, and they have all that lithic grandeur which is
inherent in large masses of precious materials.Such a temple as that near the Sphinx cannot compete either in richness
or magnificence with the great temples of Thebes, with their sculptured
capitals and storied walls, but there is a beauty of repose and an
elegance of simplicity about the older example which goes far to redeem
its other deficiencies, and when we have more examples before us they
may rise still higher in our estimation.Whatever opinion we may ultimately form regarding their architecture,
there can be little doubt as to the rank to be assigned to their
painting and sculpture.In these two arts the Egyptians early attained a
mastery which they never surpassed.Judged by the rules of classic or of
modern art, it appears formal and conventional to such an extent as to
render it difficult for us now to appreciate its merits.But as a purely
Phonetic form of art—as used merely to enunciate those ideas which we
now so much more easily express by alphabetic writings—it is clear and
precise beyond any picture-writings the world has since seen.Judged by
its own rules, it is marvellous to what perfection the Egyptians had
attained at that early period, and if we look on their minor edifices as
mere vehicles for the display of this pictorial expression, we must
modify to some extent the judgment we would pass on them as mere objects
of architectural art.XITH AND XIITH DYNASTY OF MANETHO.Sankhkara                 reigned 46 years.Amenemhat                 reigned 38 years.Osirtasen                 reigned 48 years.(Lampares) reigned  8 years.His successors            reigned 42 years.The great culminating period of the old kingdom of Egypt is that
belonging to the 4th and 5th dynasties.Nine-tenths of the monuments of
the pyramid-builders which have come down to our time belong to the five
centuries during which these two dynasties ruled over Egypt (B.C.The 6th dynasty was of a southern and more purely African origin.On the
tablets of Apap[45] (Apophis), its most famous monarch, we find the
worship of Khem and other deities of the Theban period wholly unknown to
the pyramid kings.The next four dynasties are of _fainéant_ kings, of
whom we know little, not “Carent quia vate sacro,” but because they were
not builders, and their memory is lost.The 11th and 12th usher in a new
state of affairs.The old Memphite pyramid-building kingdom had passed,
with its peaceful contentment, and had given place to a warlike
idolatrous race of Theban kings, far more purely African, the prototypes
of the great monarchy of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and having no
affinity with anything we know of as existing in Asia in those times.Their empire lasted apparently for more than 300 years in Upper Egypt;
but for the latter portion of that period they do not seem to have
reigned over the whole country, having been superseded in Lower Egypt by
the invasion of the hated Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, about the year 2300
B.C., and by whom they also were finally totally overthrown.When we turn from the contemplation of the pyramids, and the monuments
contemporary with them, to examine those of the 12th dynasty, we become
at once aware of the change which has taken place.Instead of the
pyramids, all of which are situated on the western side of the Nile, we
have obelisks, which, without a single exception, are found on its
eastern side towards the rising sun, apparently in contradistinction to
the valley of the dead, which was towards the side on which he set.The
earliest and one of the finest of these obelisks is that still standing
at Heliopolis, inscribed with the name of Osirtasen, one of the first
and greatest kings of this dynasty.in height,
without the pyramidion which crowns it, and is a splendid block of
granite, weighing 217 tons.It must have required immense skill to
quarry it, to transport it from Syene, and finally, after finishing it,
to erect it where it now stands and has stood for 4500 years.We find the sculptures of the same king at Wady Halfah, near the second
cataract, in Nubia; and at Sarabout el Kadem, in the Sinaitic Peninsula.He also commenced the great temple of Karnac at Thebes, which in the
hands of his successors became the most splendid in Egypt, and perhaps
it is not too much to say the greatest architectural monument in the
whole world.As might be expected, from our knowledge of the fact that the Hyksos
invasion took place so soon after his reign, none of his structural
buildings now remain entire in which we might read the story of his
conquests, and learn to which gods of the Pantheon he especially devoted
himself.We must therefore fall back on Manetho for an account of his
“conquering all Asia in the space of nine years, and Europe as far as
Thrace.”[46] While there is nothing to contradict this statement, there
is much that renders it extremely probable.It is to this dynasty also that we owe the erection of the Labyrinth,
one of the most remarkable, as well as one of the most mysterious
monuments of Egypt.All Manetho tells us of this is, that Lampares, or
Mœris, “built it as a sepulchre for himself;” and the information we
derive from the Greeks on this subject is so contradictory and so full
of the wonderful, that it is extremely difficult to make out either the
plan or the purpose of the building.As long ago as 1843, the whole site
was excavated and thoroughly explored by the officers of the Prussian
expedition under Lepsius; but, like most of the information obtained by
that ill-conditioned party, such data as have been given are of the most
unsatisfactory and fragmentary form.The position which Lepsius claimed
for the Labyrinth has been found by Mr.Petrie[47] to be incorrect; the
remains supposed to be those of the walls and chambers are of much later
date, being only the houses and tombs of the population which destroyed
the great structure.The village thus created was established on the
outer portion of the site when the destruction of the buildings was
first commenced.Petrie calculates that the Labyrinth was
symmetrical with the pyramid, and had the same axis: that it occupied a
site of about 1000 feet wide by 800 ft.deep; thus covering an area
sufficiently large to accommodate all the Theban temples on the east
bank, and in addition one of the largest on the west bank.The essential
difference between the Labyrinth and all other temples was that it
consisted of a series of eighteen large peristylar courts with
sanctuaries and other chambers.Of these, according to Herodotus, there
were six, side by side, facing north; six others, opposite, facing
south, and a wall surrounding the whole.Herodotus, however, was allowed
to see portions only of the Labyrinth, probably those nearest to the
entrance.Beyond this, on the north side, Mr.Petrie suggests the
existence of a third series of peristylar courts (described by Strabo),
with sanctuaries and other chambers, and south of these, halls of
columns, and smaller halls, through which Strabo entered.In the hall of
twenty-seven columns, mentioned by Strabo, Mr.Petrie places the columns
in one row to form a vestibule to the entrances to the courts similar to
the temple of Abydos.The whole disposition of the plan, the style of
the courts and their peristyles must be conjectural, as no remains of
blocks of stone or columns in sufficient preservation have been found on
which to base a restoration.On some architrave blocks were found
inscriptions of Amenemhat III.The last remains were
taken away within our own time by the engineers of the new railway, and
apparently with the consent of the officials of the Boulak Museum, who
reported that they had been quarried from the native rock.The Hawara Pyramid, on the north of the Labyrinth, and erected by the
same King Amenemhat III., has been examined by Mr.[48] As the rock on which it was built was little more than
hardened sand, a pit was excavated, into which a monolithic chamber of
granite, brought from Upper Egypt, and weighing 100 tons, was lowered.The sarcophagus and two other coffins having been placed in it, the
chamber was covered over with three granite beams, 4 feet thick, one of
which was raised in a hollow chamber, and supported there till after the
King’s death and the deposit of his body in the sarcophagus.Round the
granite monolith were built walls which carried two courses of stone
blocks, the lower horizontal, the upper courses sloping one against the
other, as in the Great Pyramid.The rest of the pyramid was constructed
in brick, and to prevent the brickwork settling down and splitting on
the pointed roof-stones, an arch of five courses of brick, measuring 3
feet deep, was thrown across, resting on bricks laid in mud between the
arch and the stonework.The brickwork above the arch was laid in sand,
and the whole pyramid covered with a casing of limestone.Petrie calculates to have been about 334 ft.A second pyramid belonging to this dynasty, and erected by Osirtasen
II., has also been examined and described by Mr.[49] This
pyramid (Illahun) is of peculiar construction, being partly composed of
the natural rock dressed into form to a height of 40 feet, above which
rose the built portion, which was different from that of any other
pyramid, being built with a framing of cross walls.The walls ran right
through the diagonals up to the top of the building, and had offset
walls at right angles to the sides, the walls being of stone in the
lower part, and brick above; the filling-in between the walls was of mud
and brick, and the whole pyramid, brick, stone, and rock, was covered
with a casing of limestone.Petrie in the Fayum[50] was
the finding of the plan, more or less complete, of the town or village
of Kahun, which was built for the workmen and overseers of the Illahun
pyramid, and deserted shortly after its completion.The plan would seem
to have been laid out from one design, and consisted: of an acropolis or
raised space, where the house of the chief controller of the works was
placed, and which might have been occupied by the King when he came to
inspect the works: a series of large houses (Woodcut No.14), arranged
very much in the same way as those of Pompeii, and containing a great
number of halls, courts, and rooms; and many streets of workmen’s
dwellings of two or three rooms each.The walls were all built in crude
brick, the rooms being covered over with roofs formed of beams of wood,
on which poles were placed, and to these bundles of straw and reeds
lashed down, the whole being covered inside and outside with mud.In
those rooms, which exceeded 8 or 9 ft.in width, columns of stone or
wood were employed to assist in carrying the roof; such columns being
octagonal or with sixteen sides, fluted or ribbed like the reed or lotus
column at Beni-Hasan.The lower portion of a fluted column in wood was
found, existing still in situ on its base, which shows that description
of column to have had a wooden origin.The most interesting series of monuments of this dynasty which have come
down to our time are the tombs of Beni-Hasan, in Middle Egypt.They are
situated on the eastern side of the Nile, as are also those of
Tel-el-Amarna, Sheykh-Said, Kôm-el-ahman, and others.The character of
the sculptures which adorn their walls approaches that found in the
tombs surrounding the pyramids, but the architecture differs widely.They are all cheerful-looking halls, open to the light of day, many of
them with pillared porches, and all possessing pretensions to
architectural ornament, either internal or external.One of the most interesting of the tombs has in front of it a
portico-in-antis of two columns, in architecture so like the order
afterwards employed by the Greeks, as to have been frequently described
as the Proto-Doric order.[51] The same class of column is also used
internally, supporting a plain architrave beam, from which spring
curvilinear roofs of segmented form, which there is no doubt are
imitations of constructive arch forms.Proto-Doric Pillar at Beni-Hasan.]Reed Pillar from Beni-Hasan.]Lotus pier, Zawyet-el-Mayyitûr.There is another form of pillar used at Beni-Hasan at that early age[52]
which is still further removed from stone than even the Proto-Doric.It
imitates a bundle of four reeds or lotus-stalks bound together near the
top, and bulging above the ligature so as to form a capital.Such a pier
must evidently have been originally employed in wooden architecture
only, and the roof which it supports is in this instance of light wooden
construction, having the slight <DW72> requisite in the dry climate of
Egypt.In after ages this form of pillar became a great favourite with
the Egyptian architects, and was employed in all their great monuments,
but with a far more substantial lithic form than we find here, and in
conjunction with the hollow—or, as we should call it, Corinthian—formed
capital, of which no example is found earlier than the 18th dynasty.These are meagre records, it must be confessed, of so great a kingdom;
but when we come to consider the remoteness of the period, and that the
dynasty was overthrown by the Shepherds, whose rule was of considerable
duration, it is perhaps in vain to expect that much can remain to be
disinterred which would enable us to realise more fully the
architectural art of this age.Till very recently our knowledge of the Shepherd kings was almost
entirely derived from what was said of them by Manetho, in the extracts
from his writings so fortunately preserved by Josephus, in his answer to
Apion.Recent explorations have however raised a hope that even their
monuments may be so far recovered as to enable us to realise to some
extent at least who they were and what their aspirations.Manetho tells us they came from the East, but fearing the then rising
power of the Assyrians, they fortified Avaris as a bulwark against them,
and used it during their sojourn in Egypt to keep up their
communications with their original seat.Recent explorations have
enabled M. Mariette to identify San, Zoan, or Tanis, a well-known site
on the Bubastite branch of the Nile, with this Avaris.And already he
has disinterred a sphinx and two seated statues which certainly belong
to the reign of the Shepherd king Apophis.[53]

The character of these differs widely from anything hitherto found in
Egypt.They present a physiognomy strongly marked with an Asiatic
type—an arched nose, rude bushy hair, and great muscular development;
altogether something wholly different from everything else found in
Egypt either before or afterwards.This is not much, but it is an earnest that more remains to be
discovered, and adds another to the proofs that are daily accumulating,
how implicitly Manetho may be relied upon when we only read him
correctly, and how satisfactory it is to find that every discovery that
is made confirms the conclusions we had hesitatingly been adopting.It appears from such fragmentary evidence as has hitherto been gleaned
from the monuments, that the Shepherds’ invasion was neither sudden nor
at once completely successful, if indeed it ever was so, for it is
certain that Theban and Xoite dynasties co-existed with the Shepherds
during the whole period of their stay, either from policy, like the
protected princes under our sway in India, or because their conquest was
not so complete as to enable them to suppress the national dynasties
altogether.Like the Tartars in China they seem to have governed the country by
means of the original inhabitants, but for their own purposes;
tolerating their religion and institutions, but ruling by the superior
energy of their race the peace-loving semi-Semitic inhabitants of the
Delta, till they were in their turn overthrown and expelled by the more
warlike but more purely African races of the southern division of the
Egyptian valley.PRINCIPAL KINGS OF THE GREAT THEBAN PERIOD.1830

Shepherds and Exode of the Jews comprise the culminating period of the
greatness and greatest artistic development of the Egyptians.It is
practically within this period that all the great buildings of the
“Hundred pyloned city of Thebes” were erected.Memphis was adorned
within its limits with buildings as magnificent as those of the southern
capital, though subsequently less fortunate in escaping the hand of the
spoiler; and in every city of the Delta wherever an obelisk or
sculptured stone is found, there we find almost invariably the name of
one of the kings of the 18th or 19th dynasties.In Arabia, too, and
above the cataracts of the far-off Meroë, everywhere their works and
names are found.At Arban,[55] on the Khabour, we find the name of the
third Thothmes; and there seems little doubt but that the Naharaina or
Mesopotamia was one of the provinces conquered by them, and that all
Western Asia was more or less subject to their sway.Whoever the conquering Thebans may have been, their buildings are
sufficient to prove, as above mentioned, that they belonged to a race
differing in many essential respects from that of the Memphite kingdom
they had superseded.The pyramid has disappeared as a form of royal sepulchre, to be replaced
by a long gloomy corridor cut in the rock; its walls covered with wild
and fetish pictures of death and judgment: a sort of magic hall, crowded
with mysterious symbols the most monstrous and complicated that any
system of human superstition has yet invented.Instead of the precise orientation and careful masonry of the old
kingdom, the buildings of the new race are placed anywhere, facing in
any direction, and generally affected with a symmetriphobia that it is
difficult to understand.The pylons are seldom in the axis of the
temples; the courts seldom square; the angles frequently not right
angles, and one court succeeding another without the least reference to
symmetry.The masonry, too, is frequently of the rudest and clumsiest sort, and
would long ago have perished but for its massiveness: and there is in
all their works an appearance of haste and want of care that sometimes
goes far to mar the value of their grandest conceptions.In their manners, too, there seems an almost equal degree of
discrepancy.War was the occupation of the kings, and foreign conquest
seems to have been the passion of the people.The pylons and the walls
of the temples are covered with battle-scenes, or with the enumeration
of the conquests made, or the tribute brought by the subjected races.While not engaged in this, the monarch’s time seems to have been devoted
to practising the rites of the most complicated and least rational form
of idolatry that has yet been known to exist among any body of men in
the slightest degree civilised.If the monuments of Memphis had come down to our times as perfect as
those of Thebes, some of these differences might be found less striking.On the other hand, others might be still more apparent; but judging from
such data as we possess—and they are tolerably extensive and complete—we
are justified in assuming a most marked distinction; and it is
indispensably necessary to bear it in mind in attempting to understand
the architecture of the valley of the Nile, and equally important in any
attempt to trace the affinities of the Egyptian with any other races of
mankind.So far as we can now see, it may be possible to trace some
affinities with the pyramid builders in Assyria or in Western Asia; but
if any can be dimly predicated of the southern Egyptian race, it is in
India and the farther east; and the line of communication was not the
Isthmus of Suez, but the Straits of Babelmandeb and the Indian Ocean.Although, as already mentioned, numerous buildings of the great
Pharaonic dynasties are to be found scattered all along the banks of the
Nile, it is at Thebes only that the temples are so complete as to enable
us to study them with advantage, or to arrive at a just appreciation of
their greatness.That city was practically the capital of Egypt during
the whole of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and has been fortunate in
having had no great city built near it since it fell into decay; unlike
Memphis in this respect, which has been used as a quarry during the last
14 or 15 centuries.It has also had the advantage of a barrier of rocky
hills on its western limits, which has prevented the sand of the desert
from burying its remains, as has been the case at Abydus and elsewhere.The ruins that still remain are found scattered over an area extending
about 2¼ miles north and south, and 3½ miles east and west.The
principal group is at Karnac, on the eastern bank of the Nile,
consisting of one great temple 1200 feet long, and five or six smaller
temples grouped unsymmetrically around it.About two miles farther south
is the temple at Luxor 820 feet long, and without any dependencies.On the other side of the river is the great temple of Medeenet-Habû,
built by the first king of the 19th dynasty, 520 feet in length; the
Rameseum, 570 feet long, and the temple at Koorneh, of which only the
sanctuary and the foundations of the Propyla now exist.Of the great
temple of Thothmes and Amenophis very little remains above ground—it
having been situated within the limits of the inundation—except the two
celebrated colossi, one of which was known to the Greeks as the vocal
Memnon.When complete it probably was, next after Karnac, the most
extensive of Theban temples.There are several others, situated at the
foot of the Libyan hills, which would be considered as magnificent
elsewhere, but sink into insignificance when compared with those just
enumerated.Central Pillar, from Rameseum, Thebes.]Most of these, like our mediæval cathedrals, are the work of successive
kings, who added to the works of their ancestors without much reference
to congruity of plan; but one, the Rameseum, was built wholly by the
great Rameses in the 15th century B.C., and though the inner sanctuary
is so ruined that it can hardly be restored, still the general
arrangement, as shown in the annexed woodcut, is so easily made out that
it may be considered as a typical example of what an Egyptian temple of
this age was intended to have been.Its façade is formed by two great
pylons, or pyramidal masses of masonry, which, like the two western
towers of a Gothic cathedral, are the appropriate and most imposing part
of the structure externally.Between these is the entrance doorway,
leading, as is almost invariably the case, into a great square
courtyard, with porticoes always on two, and sometimes on three, sides.This leads to an inner court, smaller, but far more splendid than the
first.On the two sides of this court, through which the central passage
leads, are square piers with colossi in front, and on the right and left
are double ranges of circular columns, which are continued also behind
the square piers fronting the entrance.Passing through this, we come to
a hypostyle hall of great beauty, formed by two ranges of larger columns
in the centre, and three rows of smaller ones on each side.These
hypostyle halls almost always accompany the larger Egyptian temples of
the great age.They derive their name from having, over the lateral
columns, what in Gothic architecture would be called a _clerestory_,
through which the light is admitted to the central portion of the hall.Although some are more extensive than this, the arrangement of all is
nearly similar.They all possess two ranges of columns in the centre, so
tall as to equal the height of the side columns together with that of
the attic which is placed on them.They are generally of different
orders; the central pillars having a bell-shaped capital, the under side
of which was perfectly illuminated from the mode in which the light was
introduced; while in the side pillars the capital was narrower at the
top than at the bottom, apparently for the sake of allowing its
ornaments to be seen.Beyond this are always several smaller apartments, in this instance
supposed to be nine in number, but they are so ruined that it is
difficult to be quite certain what their arrangement was.These seem to
have been rather suited to the residences of the king or priests than to
the purposes of a temple, as we understand the word.Indeed,
Palace-Temple, or Temple-Palace, would be a more appropriate term for
these buildings than to call them simply Temples.They do not seem to
have been appropriated to the worship of any particular god, but rather
for the great ceremonials of royalty—of kingly sacrifice to the gods for
the people, and of worship of the king himself by the people, who seems
to have been regarded, if not as a god, at least as the representative
of the gods on earth.Though the Rameseum is so grand from its dimensions, and so beautiful
from its design, it is far surpassed in every respect by the
palace-temple at Karnac, which is perhaps the noblest effort of
architectural magnificence ever produced by the hand of man.in length, by about 360 in width,
and it covers therefore about 430,000 square ft., or nearly twice the
area of St.Peter’s at Rome, and more than four times that of any
mediæval cathedral existing.This, however, is not a fair way of
estimating its dimensions, for our churches are buildings entirely under
one roof; but at Karnac a considerable portion of the area was uncovered
by any buildings, so that no comparison is just.The great hypostyle
hall, however, is internally 330 ft.by 170, and, with its two pylons,
it covers more than 85,000 square feet—nearly as large as Cologne, one
of the largest of our northern cathedrals; and when we consider that
this is only a part of a great whole, we may fairly assert that the
entire structure is among the largest, as it undoubtedly is one of the
most beautiful, buildings in the world.The original part of this great group was, as before mentioned, the
sanctuary or temple built by Osirtasen, the great monarch of the 12th
dynasty, before the Shepherd invasion.It is the only thing that seems
to have been allowed to stand during the five centuries of Shepherd
domination, though it is by no means clear that it had not been pulled
down by the Shepherds, and reinstated by the first kings of the 18th
dynasty, an operation easily performed with the beautiful polished
granite masonry of the sanctuary.Be this as it may, Amenhotep, the
first king of the restored race, enclosed this in a temple about 120 ft.Thothmes I. built in front of it a splendid hall, surrounded by
colossi, backed by piers; and Thothmes III.erected behind it a palace
or temple, which is one of the most singular buildings in Egypt.long by 55 in width internally, the roof is supported by
two rows of massive square columns, and two of circular pillars of most
exceptional form, the capitals of which are reversed, and somewhat
resembling the form usually found in Assyria, but nowhere else in Egypt.Like almost all Egyptian halls, it was lighted from the roof in the
manner shown in the section.With all these additions, the temple was a
complete whole, 540 ft.in length by 280 in width, at the time when the
Sun-worshippers broke in upon the regular succession of the great 18th
dynasty.Section of Palace of Thothmes III., Thebes.]When the original line was resumed, Meneptah commenced the building of
the great hall, which he nearly completed.Rameses, the first king of
the 19th dynasty, built the small temple in front; and the so-called
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty added the great court in front,
completing the building to the extent we now find it.We have thus, as
in some of our mediæval cathedrals, in this one temple a complete
history of the style during the whole of its most flourishing period;
and, either for interest or for beauty, it forms such a series as no
other country, and no other age, can produce.Besides those buildings
mentioned above, there are other temples to the north, to the east, and
more especially to the south, and pylons connecting these, and avenues
of sphinxes extending for miles, and enclosing-walls, and tanks, and
embankments—making up such a group as no city ever possessed before or
since.Peter’s, with its colonnades, and the Vatican, make up an
immense mass, but as insignificant in extent as in style when compared
with this glory of ancient Thebes and its surrounding temples.Plan of Hypostyle Hall at Karnac.Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.Section of central portion of Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac.The culminating point and climax of all this group of building is the
hypostyle hall of Meneptah.The plan and section of its central portion
on the next page, both to the usual scale, will explain its general
arrangement; but no language can convey an idea of its beauty, and no
artist has yet been able to reproduce its form so as to convey to those
who have not seen it an idea of its grandeur.The mass of its central
piers, illumined by a flood of light from the clerestory, and the
smaller pillars of the wings gradually fading into obscurity, are so
arranged and lighted as to convey an idea of infinite space; at the same
time, the beauty and massiveness of the forms, and the brilliancy of
their  decorations, all combine to stamp this as the greatest of
man’s architectural works; but such a one as it would be impossible to
reproduce, except in such a climate and in that individual style in
which, and for which, it was created.Caryatide Pillar, from the Great Court at
Medeenet-Habû.]On the same side of the Nile, and probably at one time connected with it
by an avenue of sphinxes, stands the temple of Luxor, hardly inferior in
some respects to its great rival at Karnac; but either it was never
finished, or, owing to its proximity to the Nile, it has been ruined,
and the materials carried away.The length is about 830 ft., its breadth
ranging from 100 to 200 ft.Its general arrangement comprised, first, a
great court at a different angle from the rest, being turned so as to
face Karnac.In front of this stand two colossi of Rameses the Great,
its founder, and two obelisks were once also there, one of which is now
in Paris.Behind this was once a great hypostyle hall, but only the two
central ranges of columns are now standing.Still further back were
smaller halls and numerous apartments, evidently meant for the king’s
residence, rather than for a temple or place exclusively devoted to
worship.The palace at Luxor is further remarkable as a striking instance of how
regardless the Egyptians were of regularity and symmetry in their plans.Not only is there a considerable angle in the direction of the axis of
the building, but the angles of the courtyards are in scarcely any
instance right angles; the pillars are variously spaced, and pains seem
to have been gratuitously taken to make it as irregular as possible in
nearly every respect.All the portion at the southern end was erected by
Amenhotep III., the northern part completed by Rameses the Great, the
same who built the Rameseum already described as situated on the other
bank of the Nile.Besides these there stood on the western side of the Nile the Memnonium,
or great temple of Amenhotep III., now almost entirely ruined.It was
placed on the alluvial plain, within the limits of the inundation, which
has tended on the one hand to bury it, and on the other to facilitate
the removal of its materials.Nearly the only remains of it now apparent
are the two great seated colossi of its founder, one of which, when
broken, became in Greek, or rather Roman times, the vocal Memnon, whose
plaintive wail to the rising sun, over its own and its country’s
desolation, forms so prominent an incident in the Roman accounts of
Thebes.[56]

[Illustration: 25.Section through Hall of Columns, South Temple of
Karnac.Not far from this stands the great temple known as that of
Medeenet-Habû, built by the first king of the 19th dynasty.Its
dimensions are only slightly inferior to those of the Rameseum, being
520 ft.from front to rear, and its propylon 107 ft.Its two great
courts are, however, inferior in size to those of that building.The
inner one is adorned by a series of Caryatide figures (Woodcut No.24),
which are inferior both in conception and execution to those of the
previous reigns; and indeed throughout the whole building there is an
absence of style, and an exaggeration of detail, which shows only too
clearly that the great age was passing away when it was erected.The
roof of its hypostyle hall, and of the chambers beyond it, is occupied
by an Arab village, which would require to be cleared away before it
could be excavated; much as this might be desired, the details of its
courts would not lead us to expect anything either very beautiful or new
from its disinterment.Further down the river, as already mentioned,
stood another temple, that of Koorneh, built by the same Meneptah who
erected the great hall of Karnac.It is, however, only a fragment, or
what may be called the residential part of a temple.The hypostyle hall
never was erected, and only the foundations of two successive pylons can
be traced in front of it.In its present condition, therefore, it is one
of the least interesting of the temples of Thebes, though elsewhere it
would no doubt be regarded with wonder.Another building of this age, attached to the southern side of the great
temple of Karnac, deserves especial attention as being a perfectly
regular building, erected at one time, and according to the original
design, and strictly a temple, without anything about it that could
justify the supposition of its being a palace.It was erected by the first king of the 19th dynasty, and consists of
two pylons, approached through an avenue of sphinxes.Within this is an
hypæthral court, and beyond that a small hypostyle hall, lighted from
above, as shown in the section (Woodcut No.Within this is the
cell, surrounded by a passage, and with a smaller hall beyond, all
apparently dark, or very imperfectly lighted.The gateway in front of
the avenue was erected by the Ptolemys, and, like many Egyptian
buildings, is placed at a different angle to the direction of the
building itself.Besides its intrinsic beauty, this temple is
interesting as being far more like the temples erected afterwards under
the Greek and Roman domination than anything else belonging to that
early age.At Tanis, or Zoan, near the mouth of the Nile, the remains of a temple
and of 13 obelisks can still be traced.At Soleb, on the borders of
Nubia, a temple now stands of the Third Amenhotep, scarcely inferior in
beauty or magnificence to those of the capital.At Sedinga, not far below the third cataract, are the remains of temples
erected by Amenhotep III.of the 18th dynasty, which are interesting as
introducing in a completed form a class of pillar that afterwards became
a great favourite with Egyptian architects (Woodcut No.Before this
time we find these Isis heads either painted or carved on the face of
square piers, but so as not to interfere with the lines of the pillars.Gradually they became more important, so as to form a double capital, as
in this instance.In the Roman times, as at Denderah (Woodcut No.143), all the four faces of the pier were so adorned, though it must be
admitted in very questionable taste.It would be tedious to attempt to enumerate without illustrating all the
fragments that remain of temples of this age.Some are so ruined that it
is difficult to make out their plan.Others, like those of Memphis or
Tanis, so entirely destroyed, that only their site, or at most only
their leading dimensions, can be made out.Their loss is of course to be
regretted; but those enumerated above are sufficient to enable us to
judge both of the style and the magnificence of the great building
epoch.At Abydus the remains of two great temples have been found; one of
Rameses II., with great court surrounded by piers with osireide figures
on them; two halls of columns, a sanctuary, and other small chambers in
the rear.The other, completed only and decorated with sculpture by
Rameses II., the temple having been built by his father, Sethi I. This
second temple differs in the arrangement of its plan from other examples
(Woodcut No.29); it was preceded by two great courts; at the further
end of the second court was a peristyle with twelve piers, from which,
through three doors, a hall of twenty-four columns was reached; the
columns here were so arranged as to suggest seven avenues, beyond which
were seven doors leading to a second hall with thirty-six columns,
similarly disposed to those in the first hall.These avenues led to
seven sanctuaries, the roofs of which were segmental, the arched form of
vault being cut out of solid blocks of stone (Woodcut No.Beyond
the sepulchral destination, which roofs of these sanctuaries suggest,
nothing is known from inscriptions as to their precise use.Through one
of the sanctuaries other halls of columns and chambers were reached
which lie in the rear of the building, and on the south side, and
approached from the second great hall of columns, many other halls,
chambers, and staircases leading to the roof.The special interest to
the Egyptologist, however, of this temple lies in the fact that it was
on the walls of one of these that the so-called tablet of Abydus was
discovered—now in the British Museum—which first gave a connected list
of kings, the predecessors of Rameses, and sufficiently extensive to
confirm the lists of Manetho in a manner satisfactory to the ordinary
inquirer.A second list, far more complete, has recently been brought to
light in the same locality, and contains the names of 76 kings,
ancestors of Meneptah, the father of Rameses.It begins, as all lists
do, with Menes; but even this list is only a selection, omitting many
names found in Manetho, but inserting others which are not in his
lists.[57] Before the discovery of this perfect list, the longest known
were that of the chamber of the ancestors of Thothmes III., at Karnac,
containing when perfect 61 names, of which, however, nearly one-third
are obliterated; and that recently found at Saccara, containing 58 names
originally, but of which several are now illegible.It is the existence of these lists which gives such interest and such
reality to the study of Architecture in Egypt.Fortunately there is
hardly a building in that country which is not adorned with the name of
the king in whose reign it was erected.In royal buildings they are
found on every wall and every pillar.The older cartouches are simple
and easily remembered; and when we find the buildings thus dated by the
builders themselves, and their succession recorded by subsequent kings
on the walls of their temples, we feel perfectly certain of our
sequence, and nearly so of the actual dates of the buildings; they are,
moreover, such a series as no other country in the world can match
either for historic interest or Architectural magnificence.ROCK-CUT TOMBS AND TEMPLES.But in Egypt Proper and in Nubia the Egyptians were in the habit of
excavating monuments from the living rock, but with this curious
distinction, that, with scarcely an exception, all the excavations in
Egypt Proper are tombs, and no important example of a rock-cut temple
has yet been discovered.In Nubia, on the other hand, all the
excavations are temples, and no tombs of importance are to be found
anywhere.This distinction may hereafter lead to important historical
deductions, inasmuch as on the western side of India there are an
infinite number of rock-cut temples, but no tombs of any sort.Every
circumstance seems to point to the fact that, if there was any
connection between Africa and India, it was with the provinces in the
upper part of the Valley of the Nile, and not with Egypt Proper.This,
however, is a subject that can hardly be entered on here, though it may
be useful to bear in mind the analogy alluded to.Plan and Section of Rock-cut Temple at Abû Simbel.Like all rock-cut examples all over the world, these Nubian temples are
copies of structural buildings only more or less modified to suit the
exigencies of their situation, which did not admit of any very great
development inside, as light and air could only be introduced from the
one opening of the doorway.The two principal examples of this class of monument are the two at Abû
Simbel, the larger of which is the finest of its class known to exist
anywhere.Its total depth from the face of the rock is 150 ft., divided
into 2 large halls and 3 cells, with passages connecting them.Externally the façade is about 100 ft.in height, and adorned by 4 of
the most magnificent colossi in Egypt, each 70 ft.in height, and
representing the king, Rameses II., who caused the excavation to be
made.It may be because they are more perfect than any others now found
in that country, but certainly nothing can exceed their calm majesty and
beauty, or be more entirely free from the vulgarity and exaggeration
which is generally a characteristic of colossal works of this sort.The smaller temple at the same place has six standing figures of deities
countersunk in the rock, and is carved with exceeding richness.It is of
the same age with the large temple, but will not admit of comparison
with it owing to the inferiority of the design.Besides these, there is a very beautiful though small example at
Kalabsheh (known as the Bayt el Wellee, “the house of the saint”),
likewise belonging to the age of Rameses II., and remarkable for the
beauty of its sculptural bas-reliefs, as well as for the bold
Proto-Doric columns which adorn its vestibule.There are also smaller
ones at Dêrr and Balagne, at the upper end of the valley.At Wâdy Saboua
and Gerf Hussên, the cells of the temple have been excavated from the
rock, but their courts and propylons are structural buildings added in
front—a combination only found once in Egypt, at Thebes (Dêr-el-Bahree),
and very rare anywhere else, although meeting the difficulties of the
case better than any other arrangement, inasmuch as the sanctuary has
thus all the imperishability and mystery of a cave, and the temple at
the same time has the space and external appearance of a building
standing in the open air.This last arrangement is found also as a characteristic of the temples
of Gebel Barkal, in the kingdom of Meroë, showing how far the
rock-cutting practice prevailed in the Upper Valley of the Nile.The plan on which the Temple of Dêr-el-Bahree is constructed is curious,
and differs entirely from that of any other in Egypt.It is built in
stages up a <DW72> at the foot of the mountain, flights of steps leading
from one court to the other.The temple was built by Queen Hatshepsu or
Amen-noo-het, the sister of Thothmes II.and Thothmes III., and
consisted of three courts rising in terraces one above the other; at the
back of these were two ranges of porticoes, the upper one set back
behind the lower and built into the vertical face of the rock with which
the sanctuary and antechambers were cut.As all the temples above
mentioned are contemporary with the great structures in Egypt, it seems
strange that the eternity of a rock-cut example did not recommend this
form of temple to the attention of the Egyptians themselves.But with
the exception of Dêr-el-Bahree and a small grotto, called the Speos
Artemidos, near Beni-Hasan, and two small caves at Silsilis, near the
Cataract, the Egyptians seem never to have attempted it, trusting
apparently to the solidity of their masonic structures for that eternity
of duration they aspired to.In addition to the temples above described, which are all more or less
complex in plan, and all made up of various independent parts, there
exists in Egypt a class of temples called _mammeisi_, dedicated to the
mysterious accouchement of the mother of the gods.Small temples of this
form are common to all ages, and belong as well to the 18th dynasty as
to the time of the Ptolemys.One of them, built by Amenhotep III.at
Elephantine, is represented in plan and elevation in the annexed cut.It
is of a simple peristylar form, with columns in front and rear, the
latter being now built into a wall, and seven square piers on each
flank.These temples are all small, and, like the Typhonia, which
somewhat resemble them, were used as detached chapels or cells,
dependent on the larger temples.What renders them more than usually
interesting to us is the fact that they were undoubtedly the originals
of the Greek peristylar forms, that people having borrowed nearly every
peculiarity of their architecture from the banks of the Nile.We possess
tangible evidence of peristylar temples and Proto-Doric pillars erected
in Egypt centuries before the oldest known specimen in Greece.We need
therefore hardly hesitate to award the palm of invention of these things
to the Egyptians, as we should probably be forced to do for most of the
arts and sciences of the Greeks if we had only knowledge sufficient to
enable us to trace the connecting links which once joined them together,
but which are now in most instances lost, or at least difficult to find.Of the first 10 dynasties of Egyptian kings little now remains but their
tombs—the everlasting pyramids—and of the people they governed, only the
structures and rock-cut excavations which they prepared for their final
resting-places.The Theban kings and their subjects erected no pyramids, and none of
their tombs are structural—all are excavated from the living rock; and
from Beni-Hasan to the Cataract the plain of the Nile is everywhere
fringed with these singular monuments, which, if taken in the aggregate,
perhaps required a greater amount of labour to excavate and to adorn
than did even all the edifices of the plain.Certain it is that there is
far more to be learnt of the arts, of the habits, and of the history of
Egypt from these tombs than from all the other monuments.No tomb of any
Theban king has yet been discovered anterior to the 18th dynasty; but
all the tombs of that and of the subsequent dynasty have been found, or
are known to exist, in the Valley of Bibán-el-Molook, on the western
side of the plain of Thebes.It appears to have been the custom with these kings, so soon as they
ascended the throne, to begin preparing their final resting-place.The
excavation seems to have gone on uninterruptedly year by year, the
painting and adornment being finished as it progressed, till the hand of
death ended the king’s reign, and simultaneously the works of his tomb.All was then left unfinished; the cartoon of the painter and the rough
work of the mason and plasterer were suddenly broken off, as if the hour
of the king’s demise called them, too, irrevocably from their labours.The tomb thus became an index of the length of a king’s reign as well as
of his magnificence.Of those in the Valley of the Kings the most
splendid is that opened by Belzoni, and now known as that of Meneptah,
the builder of the hypostyle hall at Karnac.It descends, in a sloping
direction, for about 350 ft.into the mountain, the upper half of it
being tolerably regular in plan and direction; but after progressing as
far as the unfinished hall with two pillars, the direction changes, and
the works begin again on a lower level, probably because they came in
contact with some other tomb, or in consequence of meeting some flaw in
the rock.It now terminates in a large and splendid chamber with a coved
roof, in which stood, when opened by Belzoni, the rifled
sarcophagus;[58] but a drift-way has been excavated beyond this, as if
it had been intended to carry the tomb still further had the king
continued to reign.Plan and Section of Tomb of Meneptah at Thebes.The tomb of Rameses Maiamoun, the first king of the 19th dynasty, is
more regular, and in some respects as magnificent as this, and that of
Amenhotep III.is also an excavation of great beauty, and is adorned
with paintings of the very best age.Like all the tombs, however, they
depend for their magnificence more on the paintings that cover the walls
than on anything which can strictly be called architecture, so that they
hardly come properly within the scope of the present work: the same may
be said of private tombs.Except those of Beni-Hasan, already
illustrated by Woodcuts Nos.16 to 18, these tombs are all mere chambers
or corridors, without architectural ornament, but their walls are
covered with paintings and hieroglyphics of singular interest and
beauty.Generally speaking, it is assumed that the entrances of these
tombs were meant to be concealed and hidden from the knowledge of the
people after the king’s death.It is hardly conceivable, however, that
so much pains should have been taken, and so much money lavished, on
what was designed never again to testify to the magnificence of its
founder.It is also very unlike the sagacity of the Egyptians to attempt
what was so nearly impossible; for though the entrance of a pyramid
might be so built up as to be unrecognisable, a cutting in the rock can
never be repaired or disguised, and can only be temporarily concealed by
heaping rubbish over it.Supposing it to have been intended to conceal
the entrances, such an expedient was as clumsy and unlikely to have been
resorted to by so ingenious a people as it has proved futile, for all
the royal tombs in the valley of Bibán-el-Molook have been opened and
rifled in a past age, and their sites and numbers were matters of public
notoriety in the times of the Greeks and Romans.Many of the private
tombs have architectural façades, and certainly never were meant to be
concealed, so that it is not fair to assume that hiding their tombs’
entrances was ever a peculiarity of the Thebans, though it certainly was
of the earlier Memphite kings.Another class of monuments, almost exclusively Egyptian, are the
obelisks, which form such striking objects in front of almost all the
old temples of the country.Small models of obelisks are found in the tombs of the age of the
pyramid builders, and represented in their hieroglyphics; but the oldest
public monument of the class known to exist is that at Heliopolis,
erected by Osirtasen, the great king of the 12th dynasty.It is, like
all the others, a single block of beautiful red granite of Syene, cut
with all the precision of the age, tapering slightly towards the summit,
and of about the average proportion, being about 10 diameters in height;
exclusive of the top it is 67 ft.The two finest known to exist are, that now in the piazza of the
Lateran, originally set up by Thothmes III., 105 ft.in height, and that
still existing at Karnac, attributed to Thothmes II., 107 ft.Both are now ascribed to Queen Hatshepsu their sister, who is recorded
to have boasted that they were quarried, transported, and set up within
the short space of seven months.Those of Luxor, erected by Rameses the
Great, one of which is now in Paris, are above 77 ft.in height; and
there are two others in Rome, each above 80 ft.Rome, indeed, has 12 of these monuments within her walls—a greater
number than exist, erect at least, in the country whence they came;
though judging from the number that are found adorning single temples,
it is difficult to calculate how many must once have existed in Egypt.Their use seems to have been wholly that of monumental pillars,
recording the style and title of the king who erected them, his piety,
and the proof he gave of it in dedicating these monoliths to the deity
whom he especially wished to honour.to 1 in., for
comparison with scale of other buildings.]It has been already remarked that, with scarcely an exception, all the
pyramids are on the west side of the Nile, all the obelisks on the east;
with regard to the former class of monument, this probably arose from a
law of their existence, the western side of the Nile being in all ages
preferred for sepulture, but with regard to the latter it seems to be
accidental.Memphis doubtless possessed many monuments of this class,
and there is reason to believe that the western temples of Thebes were
also similarly adorned.They are, however, monuments easily broken; and,
from their form, so singularly useful for many building purposes, that
it is not to be wondered at if many of them have disappeared during the
centuries that have elapsed since the greater number of them were
erected.Except one small royal pavilion at Medeenet Habû, no structure now
remains in Egypt that can fairly be classed as a specimen of the
domestic architecture of the ancient Egyptians; but at the same time we
possess, in paintings and sculptures, so many illustrations of their
domestic habits, so many plans, elevations, and views, and even models
of their dwellings of every class, that we have no difficulty in forming
a correct judgment not only of the style, but of the details, of their
domestic architecture.Although their houses exhibited nothing of the solidity and monumental
character which distinguished their temples and palaces, they seem in
their own way to have been scarcely less beautiful.They were of course
on a smaller scale, and built of more perishable materials, but they
appear to have been as carefully finished, and decorated with equal
taste to that displayed in the greater works.We know also, from the
tombs that remain to us, that, although the government of Egypt was a
despotism of the strictest class, still the wealth of the land was
pretty equally diffused among all classes, and that luxury and splendour
were by no means confined either to the royal family or within the
precincts of the palace.There is thus every reason to believe that the
cities which have passed away were worthy of the temples that adorned
them, and that the streets were as splendid and as tasteful as the
public buildings themselves, and displayed, though in a more ephemeral
form, the same wealth and power which still astonish us in the great
monuments that remain.Maspero, in his work on Egyptian archæology, translated by Miss
Amelia B. Edwards[59] devotes a chapter to the description of the
existing remains of private dwellings and military architecture.The
examples of the former are of comparatively small buildings, and were
invariably built in crude or unburnt brick; in the neighbourhood of
Memphis Mr.Maspero found walls still standing, from 30 to 40 ft.The plans which are delineated on the walls of the tombs of the
18th dynasty enable us to judge of the extent and magnificence of the
more important examples.These as a rule would seem to have features
which are evidently derived from temple architecture, that is to say,
the palaces are preceded by pylons and the courts enclosed and
surrounded with porticoes.Of military architecture the oldest
fortresses are those at Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh; at Abydos the
earliest example consists of a parallelogram of crude brickwork
measuring 410 ft.The walls, which now stand from 24 to 36
ft.high, have lost somewhat of their original height: they are about 6
ft.thick at the top and were not built in uniform layers, but in huge
vertical panels easily distinguished by the nature of the brickwork.In
one division the course of the bricks is strictly horizontal, in the
next it is slightly concave, and forms a very flat reversed arch, of
which the extrados rests on the ground.The alternation of these two
methods is regularly repeated.The object of this arrangement was
possibly to resist earthquake shocks.Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.View of Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.]No building can form a greater contrast with the temple behind it than
does the little pavilion erected at Medeenet Habû by Rameses, the first
king of the 19th dynasty.As will be seen by the annexed plan (Woodcut
No.34), it is singularly broken and varied in its outline, surrounding
a small court in the shape of a cross.It is 3 storeys in height, and,
properly speaking, consists of only 3 rooms on each floor, connected
together by long winding passages.There is reason, however, to believe
that this is only a fragment of the building, and foundations exist
which render it probable that the whole was originally a square of the
width of the front, and had other chambers, probably only in wood or
brick, besides those we now find.This would hardly detract from the
playful character of the design, and when, as it originally
was, and with its battlements or ornaments complete, it must have formed
a composition as pleasing as it is unlike our usual conceptions of
Egyptian art.The other illustration represents in the Egyptians’ own quaint style a
three-storeyed dwelling, the upper storey apparently being, like those
of the Assyrians, an open gallery supported by dwarf columns.The lower
windows are closed by shutters.In the centre is a staircase leading to
the upper storey, and on the left hand an awning supported on wooden
pillars, which seems to have been an indispensable part of all the
better class of dwellings.Generally speaking, these houses are shown as
situated in gardens laid out in a quaint, formal style, with pavilions,
and fishponds, and all the other accompaniments of gardens in the East
at the present day.In all the conveniences and elegances of building they seem to have
anticipated all that has been done in those countries down to the
present day.Indeed, in all probability the ancient Egyptians surpassed
the modern in those respects as much as they did in the more important
forms of architecture.CHAPTER V

                        GREEK AND ROMAN PERIOD.Decline of art—Temples at Denderah—Kalábsheh—Philæ.The third stage of Egyptian art is as exceptional as the two which
preceded it, and as unlike anything else which has occurred in any other
lands.From the time of the 19th dynasty, with a slight revival under the
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty, Egypt sank through a long period of
decay, till her misfortunes were consummated by the invasion of the
Persians under Cambyses, 525 B.C.From that time she served in a bondage
more destructive, if not so galling, as that of the Shepherd domination,
till relieved by the more enlightened policy of the Ptolemys.Under them
she enjoyed as great material prosperity as under her own Pharaohs; and
her architecture and her arts too revived, not, it is true, with the
greatness or the purity of the great national era, but still with much
richness and material splendour.This was continued under the Roman domination, and, judging from what we
find in other countries, we would naturally expect to find traces of the
influence of Greek and Roman art in the buildings of this age.So
little, however, is this the case, that before the discovery of the
reading of the hieroglyphic signs, the learned of Europe placed the
Ptolemaic and Roman temples of Denderah and Kalábsheh before those of
Thebes in order of date; and could not detect a single moulding in the
architectural details, nor a single feature in the sculpture and
painting which adorned their walls, which gave them a hint of the truth.Even Cleopatra the beautiful is represented on these walls with
distinctly Egyptian features, and in the same tight garments and
conventional forms as were used in the portrait of Nophre Ari, Queen of
Rameses, or in those of the wives of the possessors of tombs in the age
of the pyramids, 3000 years before.Egypt in fact conquered her
conquerors, and forced them to adopt her customs and her arts, and to
follow in the groove she had so long marked out for herself, and
followed with such strange pertinacity.Some of the temples of this age are, as far as dimensions and richness
of decorations are concerned, quite worthy of the great age, though
their plans and arrangements differ to a considerable extent.There is
no longer any hesitation as to whether they should be called temples or
palaces, for they all are exclusively devoted to worship,—and to the
worship of a heavenly God, not of a deified king.What these arrangements are will be well understood from the annexed
plan of that of Edfû (Woodcut No.37), which, though not the largest, is
the most complete of those remaining.in length and 155 in
width, and covers upwards of 70,000 ft.; its dimensions may be said to
be equal to those of the largest of our mediæval cathedrals (Cologne or
Amiens, for instance).Parts only—viz., the court C, and areas M M M—of
the whole structure are roofed, and therefore it can scarcely be
compared with buildings entirely under one roof.Plan of Temple at Edfû, Apollinopolis Magna.In front of the temple are two large and splendid pylons, with the
gateway in the centre, making up a façade 225 ft.Although
this example has lost its crowning cornice, its sculptures and ornaments
are still very perfect, and it may altogether be considered as a fair
specimen of its class, though inferior in dimensions to many of those of
the Pharaonic age.by 161, surrounded
by a colonnade on three sides, and on the fourth side the porch or
portico which, in Ptolemaic temples, takes the place of the great
hypostyle halls of the Pharaohs.It is lighted from the front over low
screens placed between each of the pillars, a peculiarity scarcely ever
found in temples of earlier date, though apparently common in domestic
edifices, or those formed of wood, certainly as early as the middle of
the 18th dynasty, as may be seen from the annexed woodcut (No.39),
taken from a tomb of one of the sun-worshipping kings, who reigned
between Amenhotep III.From this we pass into an inner and
smaller porch, and again through two passages to a dark and mysterious
sanctuary, surrounded by darker passages and chambers, well calculated
to mystify and strike with awe any worshipper or neophyte who might be
admitted to their gloomy precincts.View of Temple at Edfû as it was, before it was
cleared out and the dwellings on the roof removed.]The celebrated temple at Denderah is similar to this, and slightly
larger, but it has no fore-court, no propylons, and no enclosing outer
walls.Its façade is given in the woodcut (No.Its Isis-headed
columns are not equal to those of Edfû in taste or grace; but it has the
advantage of situation, and this temple is not encumbered either by sand
or huts, which still disfigure so many Egyptian temples.Its effect,
consequently, on travellers is always more striking.The Roman temple at Kalábsheh (Woodcuts Nos.42 and 43), above the
Cataract, is a fair specimen of these temples on a smaller scale.43) shows one of the modes by which a scanty light
was introduced into the inner cells, and their gradation in height.The
position, too, of its propylons is a striking instance of the
irregularity which distinguishes all the later Egyptian styles from that
of the rigid, proportion-loving pyramid builders of Memphis.Bas-relief at Tel el Amarna.]Façade of Temple at Denderah.This irregularity of plan was nowhere carried to such an extent as in
the Ptolemaic temple on the island of Philæ (Woodcut No.Here no
two buildings, scarcely any two walls, are on the same axis or parallel
to one another.No Gothic architect in his wildest moments ever played
so freely with his lines or dimensions, and none, it must be added, ever
produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this.It contains all
the play of light and shade, all the variety, of Gothic art, with the
massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style; and as it is still
tolerably entire, and retains much of its colour, there is no building
out of Thebes that gives so favourable an impression of Egyptian art as
this.It is true it is far less sublime than many, but hardly one can be
quoted as more beautiful.Notwithstanding its irregularity, this temple has the advantage of being
nearly all of the same age, and erected according to one plan, while the
greater buildings at Thebes are often aggregations of parts of different
ages; and though each is beautiful in itself, the result is often not
quite so harmonious as might be desired.In this respect the Ptolemaic
temples certainly have the advantage, inasmuch as they are all of one
age, and all completed according to the plan on which they were
designed; a circumstance which, to some extent at least, compensates for
their marked inferiority in size and style, and the littleness of all
the ornaments and details as compared with those of the Pharaonic
period.It must at the same time be admitted that this inferiority is
more apparent in the sculpture of the Ptolemaic age than in its
architecture.The general design of the buildings is frequently grand
and imposing, but the details are always inferior; and the sculpture and
painting, which in the great age add so much to the beauty of the whole,
are in the Ptolemaic age always frittered away, ill-arranged, unmeaning,
and injurious to the general effect instead of heightening and improving
it.Pillar, from the Porticocat Denderah.]Plan of Temple at Kalábsheh.On the east side of the island is the very beautiful structure known as
“Pharaoh’s bed” (n).It is an oblong rectangular building of late date,
surrounded by an intercolumnar screen with 18 columns.It was roofed
with stone slabs supported on wooden beams, the sockets to receive which
still exist.There is a doorway on the west wall, and another on the
east wall opening on to a stone terrace or quay.Similar structures are
believed to have existed at Thebes, close to the river, and connected by
causeways with the temples; they may therefore have served as halls from
which the processions started after disembarking from the boats on the
river.Strange as it may at first sight appear, we know less of the manners and
customs of the Egyptian people during the Greek and Roman domination,
than we do of them during the earlier dynasties.All the buildings
erected after the time of Alexander which have come down to our time are
essentially temples.Nothing that can be called a palace or pavilion has
survived, and no tombs, except some of Roman date at Alexandria, are
known to exist.We have consequently no pictures of gardens, with their
villas and fish-ponds; no farms, with their cattle; no farmyards, with
their geese and ducks; no ploughing or sowing; no representations of the
mechanical arts; no dancing or amusements; no arms or campaigns.Nothing, in short, but worship in its most material and least
intellectual form.Section of Temple at Kalábsheh.It is a curious inversion of the usually received dogmata on this
subject, but as we read the history of Egypt as written on her
monuments, we find her first wholly occupied with the arts of peace,
agricultural and industrious, avoiding war and priestcraft, and
eminently practical in all her undertakings.In the middle period we
find her half political, half religious; sunk from her early happy
position to a state of affairs such as existed in Europe in the Middle
Ages.In her third and last stage we find her fallen under the absolute
influence of the most degrading superstition.We know from her masters
that she had no political freedom and no external influence at this
time; but we hardly expected to find her sinking deeper and deeper into
superstition, at a time when the world was advancing forward with such
rapid strides in the march of civilisation, as was the case between the
ages of Alexander and that of Constantine.It probably was in
consequence of this retrograde course that her civilisation perished so
absolutely and entirely under the influence of the rising star of
Christianity; and that, long before the Arab conquest, not a trace of it
was left in any form.What had stood the vicissitudes of 3000 years, and
was complete and stable under Hadrian, had vanished when Constantine
ascended the throne.If, however, their civilisation passed so suddenly away, their buildings
remain to the present day; and taken altogether, we may perhaps safely
assert that the Egyptians were the most essentially a building people of
all those we are acquainted with, and the most generally successful in
all they attempted in this way.The Greeks, it is true, surpassed them
in refinement and beauty of detail, and in the class of sculpture with
which they ornamented their buildings, while the Gothic architects far
excelled them in constructive cleverness; but with these exceptions no
other styles can be put in competition with them.At the same time,
neither Grecian nor Gothic architects understood more perfectly all the
gradations of art, and the exact character that should be given to every
form and every detail.Whether it was the plain flat-sided pyramid, the
crowded and massive hypostyle hall, the playful pavilion, or the
luxurious dwelling—in all these the Egyptians understood perfectly both
how to make the general design express exactly what was wanted, and to
make every detail, and all the various materials, contribute to the
general effect.They understood, also, better than any other nation, how
to use sculpture in combination with architecture, and to make their
colossi and avenues of sphinxes group themselves into parts of one great
design, and at the same time to use historical paintings, fading by
insensible degrees into hieroglyphics on the one hand, and into
sculpture on the other—linking the whole together with the highest class
of phonetic utterance.With the most brilliant colouring, they thus
harmonised all these arts into one great whole, unsurpassed by anything
the world has seen during the thirty centuries of struggle and
aspiration that have elapsed since the brilliant days of the great
kingdom of the Pharaohs.SERAPEUM AND APIS MAUSOLEUM.The remains of the Serapeum and the burial-places of the sacred bulls
(who, when alive, were worshipped at Memphis), were discovered by M.
Mariette in 1860-61.Of the former, sufficient traces were found to show
that it resembled in its arrangement the ordinary Egyptian temple, viz.,
with pylons, preceded by an avenue of sphinxes, and an enclosed space
behind, with halls and chambers, in one of which was the opening to the
inclined passage leading to the subterranean galleries.The earlier
tombs of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties were hewn in the rocky
platform.From the 22nd to the 25th dynasty the bulls were buried in a
subterranean gallery.The same system was adopted from the 26th dynasty
till the time of the later Ptolemies (_circa_ 50 B.C.), but the
galleries were of greater size and magnificence, having an extent of 400
yards, and the bulls were interred in immense granite sarcophagi placed
in niches, on both sides of the galleries, but never opposite to one
another.The chief historical value of the discovery rests in the
steles, or inscribed tablets, some 500 in number, placed there as
ex-votos by pious visitors, the principal examples of which are now in
the Gizeh Museum or in the Louvre.Kingdom of Meroë—Pyramids.It was long a question with the learned whether civilisation ascended or
descended the Nile—whether it was a fact, as the Greeks evidently
believed, that Meroë was the parent State whence the Egyptians had
migrated to the north, bringing with them the religion and the arts
which afterwards flourished at Thebes and Memphis—or whether these had
been elaborated in the fertile plains of Egypt, and only in later times
had extended to the Upper Nile.Recent discoveries have rendered it nearly certain that the latter is
the correct statement of the facts—within historic times at least—that
the fertile and easily cultivated Delta was first occupied and
civilised; then Thebes, and afterwards Meroë.At the same time it is by
no means improbable that the Ethiopians were of the same stock as the
Thebans, though differing essentially from the Memphites, and that the
former may have regarded these remote kindred with respect, perhaps even
with a degree of half-superstitious reverence due to their remote
situation in the centre of a thinly-peopled continent, and have in
consequence invented those fables which the Greeks interpreted too
literally.If any such earlier civilisation existed in these lands, its records and
its monuments have perished.No building is now found in Meroë whose
date extends beyond the time of the great king Tirhakah, of the 25th
Egyptian dynasty, B.C.724 to 680, unless it be those bearing the name
of one king, Amoum Gori, who was connected with the intruding race of
sun-worshippers, which broke in upon the continuous succession of the
kings of the 18th dynasty.Their monuments were all purposely destroyed
by their successors; and almost the only records we have of them are the
grottoes of Tel el Amarna, covered with their sculptures, which bear, it
must be confessed, considerable resemblance in style to those found in
Ethiopia.Even this indication is too slight to be of much value; and we
must wait for some further confirmation before founding any reasoning
upon it.The principal monuments of Tirhakah are two temples at Gibel Barkal, a
singular isolated mount near the great southern bend of the river.One
is a large first-class temple, of purely Egyptian form and design, about
500 ft.in length by 120 or 140 in width, consisting of two great
courts, with their propylons, and with internal halls and sanctuaries
arranged much like those of the Rameseum at Thebes (Woodcut No.19), and
so nearly also on the same scale as to make it probable that the one is
a copy of the other.The other temple placed near this, but as usual unsymmetrically,
consists of an outer hall, internally about 50 ft.by 60, the roof of
which is supported by four ranges of columns, all with capitals
representing figures of Typhon or busts of Isis.This leads to an inner
cell or sanctuary, cut in the rock.[60]

[Illustration:

  FIG.2.—Section and Elevation of that marked A. Scale 50 ft.There are smaller remains strewed about, indicating the existence of a
city on the spot, but nothing of architectural importance.The most remarkable monuments of the Ethiopian kingdom are the pyramids,
of which three great groups have been discovered and described.The
principal group is at a place called Dankelah, the assumed site of the
ancient Meroë, in latitude 17° north.Another is at Gibel Barkal; the
third at Nourri, a few miles lower down than the last named, but
probably only another necropolis of the same city.Compared with the great Memphite examples, these pyramids are most
insignificant in size—the largest at Nourri being only 110 ft.by 100;
at Gibel Barkal the largest is only 88 ft.square; at Meroë none exceed
60 ft.They differ also in form from those of Egypt, being
much steeper, as their height is generally equal to the width of the
base.They also all possess the roll-moulding on their angles, and all
have a little porch or pronaos attached to one side, generally
ornamented with sculpture, and forming either a chapel, or more probably
the place where the coffin of the deceased was placed.We know from the
Greeks that, so far from concealing the bodies of their dead, the
Ethiopians had a manner of preserving them in some transparent
substance, which rendered them permanently visible after death.[61]

To those familiar with the rigid orientation of those of Lower Egypt,
perhaps the most striking peculiarity of the pyramids is the more than
Theban irregularity with which they were arranged, no two being ever
placed, except by accident, at the same angle to the meridian, but the
whole being grouped with the most picturesque diversity, as chance
appears to have dictated.Among their constructive peculiarities it may be mentioned that they
seem all to have been first built in successive terraces, each less in
dimensions than that below it, something like the great pyramid at
Sakkara (Woodcut No.9), these being afterwards smoothed over by the
external straight-lined coating.Like the temples of Gibel Barkal, all these buildings appear to belong
to the Tirhakah epoch of the Ethiopian kingdom.It is extremely
improbable that any of them are as old as the time of Solomon, or that
any are later than the age of Cambyses, every indication seeming to
point to a date between these two great epochs, and to the connection of
African history with that of Asia.The ruins at Wady-el-Ooatib, a little further up the Nile than Meroë,
should perhaps be also mentioned here, if only from the importance given
to them by Heeren, who thought he had discovered in them the ruins of
the temple of Jupiter Ammon.They are, however, all in the debased style
of the worst age of Ptolemaic or Roman art in that country.They are
wholly devoid of hieroglyphics, or any indication of sanctity or
importance, and there can be little doubt that they are the remains of a
caravansera on the great commercial route between Egypt and Axum, along
which the greater part of the trade of the East arrived at Alexandria in
the days of its magnificence.Although widely differing in date from the monuments just
described—except the last—this may be the place to mention a group of
the most exceptional monuments of the world—the obelisks of Axum.It is
said they were originally 55 in number, four of them equal to that shown
in the annexed woodcut, which represents the only one now standing; but
there are fragments of several of these lying about, and some of the
smaller ones still standing, all of the same class and very similar in
design to the large one.Its height, according to Lord Valentia, is 60
ft., its width at base nearly 10, and it is of one stone.The idea is
evidently Egyptian, but the details are Indian.It is, in fact, an
Indian nine-storeyed pagoda, translated in Egyptian in the first century
of the Christian era!(From Lord Valentia’s ‘Travels.’)]

The temple most like it in India is probably that at Budh Gya.That, in
its present form, is undoubtedly more modern, but probably retains many
of its original features.It also resembles the tower at Chittore,[62]
but towers are from their form such frail structures, that certainly
nine-tenths of those that once existed have perished; and it is only
because they are so frequent still in China and other Buddhist countries
that we are sure that the accounts are true which represent them as once
as frequent as in the country of their birth.Be this as it may, this
exceptional monolith exactly represents that curious marriage of Indian
with Egyptian art which we would expect to find in the spot where the
two people came in contact, and enlisted architecture to symbolise their
commercial union.CHAPTER I.

                         ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.It is by no means impossible that the rich alluvial plain of Shinar may
have been inhabited by man as early as the Valley of the Nile; but if
this were so, it is certain that the early dwellers in the land have
left no trace of their sojourn which has as yet rewarded the research of
modern investigators.So far indeed our knowledge at present extends, we
have proof of the existence of the primitive races of mankind in the
valleys of France and England at a far earlier period than we trace
their remains on the banks of either the Euphrates or the Nile.It is
true these European vestiges of prehistoric man are not architectural,
and have consequently no place here, except in so far as they free us
from the trammels of a chronology now admitted to be too limited in
duration, but which has hitherto prevented us from grasping, as we might
have done, the significance of architectural history in its earliest
dawn.Unfortunately for our investigation of Chaldean antiquity, the works of
Berosus, the only native historian we know of, have come down to us in
even a more fragmentary state than the lists of Manetho, and the
monuments have not yet enabled us to supply those deficiencies so
completely, though there is every prospect of their eventually doing so
to a considerable extent.In the meanwhile the most successful attempt
to restore the text which has been made, is that of Herr Gutschmid,[63]
and it is probable that the dates he assigns are very near the truth.Rejecting the 1st dynasty of 86 Chaldeans and their 34,080 years as
mythical, or as merely expressing the belief of the historian that the
country was inhabited by a Chaldean race for a long time before the
Median invasion, he places that event 2458 B.C.His table of dynasties
then runs thus.—

                                      Years.8 Medes               224 commencing 2458

As every advance that has been made, either in deciphering the
inscriptions or in exploring the ruins since this reading was proposed,
have tended to confirm its correctness, it may fairly be assumed to
represent very nearly the true chronology of the country from Nimrod to
Cyrus.Assuming this to be so, it is interesting to observe that the
conquest of Babylonia by the Medes only slightly preceded the invasion
of Egypt by the Hyksos, and that the fortification of Avaris “against
the Assyrians”[64] was synchronous with the rise of the great Chaldean
dynasty, most probably under Nimrod, B.C.If this is so, the whole
of the old civilisation of Egypt under the pyramid-building kings had
passed away before the dawn of history in Babylonia.The Theban kings of
the 12th dynasty had spread their conquests into Asia, and thus it seems
brought back the reaction of the Scythic invasion on their own hitherto
inviolate land, and by these great interminglings of the nations Asia
was first raised to a sense of her greatness.What we learn from this table seems to be that a foreign invasion of
Medes—whoever they may have been—disturbed the hitherto peaceful tenor
of the Chaldean kingdom some twenty-five centuries before the Christian
era.They, in their turn, were driven out to make place for the Chaldean
dynasties, which we have every reason to suppose were those founded by
Nimrod about the year 2235 B.C.This kingdom seems to have lasted about seven centuries without any
noticeable interruption, and then to have been overthrown by an invasion
from the west about the year 1518 B.C.Can this mean the Egyptian
conquest under the kings of the great 18th dynasty?The depression of the Chaldeans enabled the Assyrians to raise their
heads and found the great kingdom afterwards known as that of Nineveh,
about the year 1273.For six centuries and a half they were the great
people of Asia, and during the latter half of that period built all
those palaces which have so recently been disinterred.They were struck down in their turn by the kings of Babylonia, who
established the second Chaldean kingdom about the year 625, but only to
give place to the Persians under Cyrus in the year 538, after little
more than a century of duration.As in the Valley of the Nile, the first kingdom was established near the
mouths of the Euphrates, and flourished there for centuries before it
was superseded by the kingdom of Nineveh, in the same manner as Thebes
had succeeded to the earlier seat of power in the neighbourhood of
Memphis.Owing to the fortunate employment of sculptured alabaster slabs to line
the walls of the palaces during the great period of Assyrian prosperity,
we are enabled to restore the plan of the royal palaces of that period
with perfect certainty, and in consequence of the still more fortunate
introduction of stone masonry during the Persian period—after they had
come into contact with the Greeks—we can understand the construction of
these buildings, and restore the form of many parts which, being
originally of wood, have perished.The Plains of Shinar possessed no
natural building material of a durable nature, and even wood or fuel of
any kind seems to have been so scarce that the architects were content
too frequently to resort to the use of bricks only dried in the sun.The
consequence is that the buildings of the early Chaldeans are now
generally shapeless masses, the plans of which it is often extremely
difficult to follow, and in no instance has any edifice been discovered
so complete that we can feel quite sure we really know all about it.Fortunately, however, the temples at Wurka and Mugheyr become
intelligible by comparison with the Birs Nimroud and the so-called tomb
of Cyrus, and the palaces of Nineveh and Khorsabad from the
corresponding ones at Susa and Persepolis.Consequently, if we attempt
to study the architecture of Chaldea, of Assyria, or of Persia, as
separate styles, we find them so fragmentary, owing to the imperfection
of the materials in which they were carried out, that it is difficult to
understand their forms.But taken as the successive developments of one
great style, the whole becomes easily intelligible; and had the southern
excavations been conducted with a little more care, there is perhaps no
feature that would have been capable of satisfactory explanation.Even
as it is, however, the explorations of the last fifteen years have
enabled us to take a very comprehensive view of what the architecture of
the valley of the Euphrates was during the 2000 years it remained a
great independent monarchy.It is a chapter in the history of the art
which is entirely new to us, and which may lead to the most important
results in clearing our ideas as to the origin of styles.Unfortunately,
it is only in a scientific sense that this is true.Except the buildings
at Persepolis, everything is buried or heaped together in such confusion
that the passing traveller sees nothing.It is only by study and
comparison that the mind eventually realises the greatness and the
beauty of the most gorgeous of Eastern monarchies, or that any one can
be made to feel that he actually sees the sculptures which a
Sardanapalus set up, or the tablets which a Nebuchadnezzar caused to be
engraved.Owing to the fragmentary nature of the materials, it must perhaps be
admitted that the study of the ancient architecture of Central Asia is
more difficult and less attractive than that of other countries and more
familiar forms.On the other hand, it is an immense triumph to the
philosophical student of art to have penetrated so far back towards the
root of Asiatic civilisation.It is besides as great a gain to the
student of history to have come actually into contact with the works of
kings whose names have been familiar to him as household words, but of
whose existence he had until lately no tangible proof.In addition to this it must be admitted that the Assyrian exploration
commenced in 1843 by M. Botta, at Khorsabad, and brought to a temporary
close by the breaking out of the war in 1855, have added an entirely new
chapter to our history of architecture; and, with the exception of that
of Egypt, probably the most ancient we can ever now hope to obtain.It
does not, it is true, rival that of Egypt in antiquity, as the Pyramids
still maintain a pre-eminence of 1000 years beyond anything that has yet
been discovered in the valley of the Euphrates, and we now know,
approximately at least, what we may expect to find on the banks of that
celebrated river.There is nothing certainly in India that nearly
approaches these monuments in antiquity, nor in China or the rest of
Asia; and in Europe, whatever may be maintained regarding primæval man,
we can hardly expect to find any building of a date prior to the Trojan
war.All our histories must therefore begin with Egypt and
Assyria—beyond them all is speculation, and new fields of discovery can
hardly be hoped for.The Assyrian discoveries are also most important in supplying data which
enable us to understand what follows, especially in the architectural
history of Greece.No one now probably doubts that the Dorian Greeks
borrowed the idea of their Doric order from the pillars of Beni-Hasan
(Woodcuts Nos.15 and 16) or Nubia—or rather perhaps from the rubble or
brick piers of Memphis or Naucratis,[65] from which these rock-cut
examples were themselves imitated.But the origin of the Ionic element
was always a mystery.We knew indeed that the Greeks practised it
principally in Asia Minor—hence its name; but we never knew how
essentially Asiatic it was till the architecture of Nineveh was revealed
to us, and till, by studying it through the medium of the buildings at
Persepolis, we were made to feel how completely the Ionic order was a
Grecian refinement on the wooden and somewhat Barbaric orders of the
Euphrates valley.It is equally, or perhaps almost more, important to know that in Chaldea
we are able to trace the origin of those Buddhist styles of art which
afterwards pervaded the whole of Eastern Asia, and it may be also the
germs of the architecture of Southern India.[66] These affinities,
however, have not yet been worked out, hardly even hinted at; but they
certainly will one day become most important in tracing the origin of
the religious development of the further East.In these researches neither the literature nor the language of the
country avail us much.If the affinities are ever traced, it will be
through the architecture, and that alone; but there is every prospect of
its proving sufficient for the purpose when properly explored.It will hardly be necessary even to allude to the decipherment of the
mysterious written characters of the Chaldeans.There is probably no one
now living, who has followed up the course of the inquiry with anything
like a proper degree of study, who has any doubt regarding the general
correctness of the interpretation of the arrow-headed inscriptions.Singularly enough, the great difficulty is with regard to proper names,
which as a rule were not spelt phonetically, but were made up of
symbols.This is provoking, as these names afford the readiest means of
comparing the monuments with our histories; and the uncertainty as to
their pronunciation has induced many to fancy that the foundation of the
whole system is unstable.But all this is becoming daily less and less
important as the history itself is being made out from the monuments
themselves.It may also be true that, when it is attempted to translate
literally metaphysical or astrological treatises, there may still be
differences of opinion as to the true meaning of a given passage; but
plain historical narratives can be read with nearly as much certainty as
a chapter of Herodotus or of Plutarch; and every day is adding to the
facility with which they can be deciphered, and to the stock of
materials and facts with which the readings may be checked or rectified.From the materials already collected, combined with the chronology above
sketched out, we are enabled to divide the architectural history of the
Middle Asiatic countries during the period of their ancient greatness
into three distinct and well-defined epochs.The ancient Babylonian or Chaldean period, ranging from B.C.2234
to 1520, comprising the ruins at Wurka, Mugheyr, Abu Shahrein, Niffer,
Kaleh Sherghat, &c. Temples, tombs, and private dwellings, all typical
of a Turanian or Scythic race.The Assyrian and second Chaldean kingdoms, founded about 1290 B.C.,
and extending down to the destruction of Babylon by Cyrus, 538 B.C.,
comprising all the buildings of Nimroud, Koyunjik, Khorsabad, and those
of the second Babylon.An architecture essentially palatial, without
tombs, and few temples, betokening the existence of a Semitic race.The Persian, commencing with Cyrus, 538 B.C., and ending with
Alexander, B.C.333, comprising Pasargadæ, Susa, and Persepolis.An
architecture copied from the preceding: palatial, with rock tombs and
small temples.Aryan it may be, but of so strangely mixed a character
that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from its sister styles.Either it seems to be that Cyrus and his descendants were of Turanian
blood, governing an Aryan people, or that they were Aryan, but that
there was so strong an infusion of Turanians among their subjects that
they were forced to follow their fashions.Perhaps a little of both: but
taking the evidence as it now stands, it seems as if the first
hypothesis is that nearest the truth.These rock-cut tombs, and the
splendour of their sepulchral arrangements generally, savour strongly of
Scythic blood; and their gorgeous palaces, their love of art, the
splendour of their state and ceremonial, all point to feelings far more
prevalent among the Turanians than to anything ever found among kings or
people of an Aryan race.None of these styles, however, are perfectly pure, or distinct one from
the other.The three races always inhabited the country as they do now.And as at this hour the Turkish governor issues his edicts in Turkish,
Arabic, and Persian, so did Darius write the history of his reign on the
rocks at Behistun in Persian, Assyrian, and the old Scythic or Median
tongue.The same three races occupied the country then as they do now.But each race was supreme in the order just given, and the style of each
predominated during the period of their sway, though impregnated with
the feelings and peculiarities of the other two.It is this, indeed,
which gives the architecture of the country in that age its peculiar
value to the archæologist.The three great styles of the world are here
placed in such close juxtaposition, that they can be considered as a
whole, illustrating and supplementing each other, but still sufficiently
distinct never to lose their most marked characteristics.The materials
are still, it must be confessed, somewhat scanty to make all this clear;
but every day is adding to them, and, even now, no one familiar with
architectural analysis can be mistaken in recognising the leading
features of the investigation.Nimrod                     B.C.Bowariyeh, Wurka         2093

Already the names of fifteen or sixteen kings belonging to these old
dynasties have been recovered, and the remains of some ten or twelve
temples have been identified as founded by them; but unfortunately none
of these are in a sufficiently perfect state to afford any certainty as
to their being entirely of this age, and all are in such a state of ruin
that, making use of all the information we possess, we cannot yet
properly restore a temple of the old Chaldean epoch.Notwithstanding this, it is a great gain to the history of architecture
to have obtained so much knowledge as we have of temples which were only
known to us before from the vague descriptions of the Greeks, and which
are the earliest forms of a type of temples found afterwards continually
cropping up in the East.It would be contrary to all experience to suppose that a people of
Turanian origin should be without temples of some sort, but, except the
description by the Greeks of the temple or tomb of Belus, we have
nothing to guide us.We have now a fair idea what the general outline of
their temples was, and even if we cannot trace their origin, we can at
least follow their descendants.There seems now no doubt but that many,
perhaps most, of the Buddhist forms of architecture in India and further
eastward, were derived from the banks of the Euphrates.Many of the
links are still wanting; but it is something to know that the Birs
Nimroud is the type which two thousand years afterwards was copied at
Pagahn in Burmah, and Boro Buddor in Java; and that the descent from
these can easily be traced in those countries and in China to the
present day.The principal reason why it is so difficult to form a distinct idea of
this old form of temple is, that the material most employed in their
construction was either crude, sun-dried, or very imperfectly-burnt
bricks; or when a better class of bricks was employed, as was probably
the case in Babylon, they have been quarried and used in the
construction of succeeding capitals.A good deal also is owing to the
circumstance that those who have explored them have in many cases not
been architects, or were persons not accustomed to architectural
researches, and who consequently have failed to seize the peculiarities
of the building they were exploring.Under these circumstances, it is fortunate that the Persians did for
these temples exactly what they accomplished for the palace forms of
Assyria.They repeated in stone in Persia what had been built in the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris with wood or with crude bricks.It
thus happens that the so-called tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadæ enables us to
verify and to supply much that is wanting in the buildings at Babylon,
and to realise much that would be otherwise indistinct in their forms.The oldest temple we know of at present is the Bowariyeh at Wurka
(Erek), erected by Urukh, at least 2000 years B.C.; but now so utterly
ruined, that it is difficult to make out what it originally was like.It
seems, however, to have consisted of two storeys at least: the lowest
about 200 feet square, of sun-dried bricks; the upper is faced with
burnt bricks, apparently of a more modern date.The height of the two
storeys taken together is now about 100 feet, and it is nearly certain
that a third or chamber storey existed above the parts that are now
apparent.[68]

The Mugheyr Temple[69] is somewhat better preserved, but in this case it
is only the lower storey that can be considered old.The cylinders found
in the angles of the upper part belong to Nabonidus, the last king of
the later Babylonian kingdom; and the third storey only exists in
tradition.Still, from such information as we have, we gather that its
plan was originally a rectangle 198 feet by 133, with nine buttresses in
the longer and six in the shorter faces.The walls <DW72> inwards in the
ratio of 1 in 10.Above them was a second storey 119 feet by 75, placed
as is usual nearer one end of the lower storey, so as to admit of a
staircase being added at the other.It is 47 feet distant from the
south-eastern end, and only 28 or 30 from the other; but whether the
whole of this was occupied by a flight of steps or not is by no means
clear.Taken altogether, the plan and probable appearance of the
building when complete may have been something like that represented in
Woodcuts Nos.48 and 49, though there are too many elements of
uncertainty to make it a restoration which can altogether be depended
upon.Diagram of Elevation of Temple at Mugheyr.The typical example of this class of temples is the Birs Nimroud,[70]
near Babylon.It is true that as it now stands every brick bears the
stamp of Nebochadnassar, by whom it was repaired, perhaps nearly
rebuilt; but there is no reason for supposing that he changed the
original plan, or that the sacred form of these temples had altered in
the interval.It owes its more perfect preservation to the fact of the
upper storey having been vitrified, after erection, by some process we
do not quite understand.This now forms a mass of slag, which has to a
great extent protected the lower storeys from atmospheric influences.In so far as it has been explored, the lower storey forms a perfect
square, 272 feet each way.Above this are six storeys, each 42 feet less
in horizontal dimensions.These are not placed concentrically on those
below them, but at a distance of only 12 feet from the south-eastern
edge, and consequently 30 feet from the N.W., and 21 feet from the two
other sides.Diagram Elevation of Birs Nimroud.The height of the three upper storeys seems to have been ascertained
with sufficient correctness to be 15 feet each, or 45 feet together.Unfortunately no excavation was undertaken to ascertain the height of
the lowest and most important storey.Sir Henry Rawlinson assumes it at
26; and I have ventured to make it 45, from the analogy of the tomb of
Cyrus and the temple at Mugheyr.The height of the two intermediate
storeys, instead of being 22 feet 6 inches, as we might expect, was 26,
which seems to have resulted from some adjustment due to the chambers
which ranged along their walls on two sides.The exact form and
dimensions of these chambers were not ascertained, which is very much to
be regretted, as they seem the counterpart of those which surrounded
Solomon’s Temple and the Viharas in India, and are consequently among
the most interesting peculiarities of this building.No attempt was made to investigate the design of the upper storey,
though it does not seem that it would be difficult to do so, as
fragments of its vaulted roof are strewed about the base of the
tower-like fragment that remains, from which a restoration might be
effected by any one accustomed to such investigations.[71] What we do
know is that it was the cella or sanctuary of the temple.[72] There
probably also was a shrine on the third platform.This temple, as we know from the decipherment of the cylinders which
were found on its angles, was dedicated to the seven planets or heavenly
spheres, and we find it consequently adorned with the colours of each.The lower, which was also richly panelled, was black, the colour of
Saturn; the next, orange, the colour of Jupiter; the third, red,
emblematic of Mars; the fourth, yellow, belonging to the sun; the fifth
and sixth, green and blue respectively, as dedicated to Venus and
Mercury; and the upper probably white, that being the colour belonging
to the Moon, whose place in the Chaldean system would be uppermost.Access to each of these storeys was obtained by stairs, probably
arranged as shown in the plan; these have crumbled away or been removed,
though probably traces of them might still have been found if the
explorations had been more complete.Another temple of the same class was exhumed at Khorsabad about twenty
years ago by M. Place.It consisted, like the one at Borsippa, of seven
storeys, but, in this instance, each was placed concentrically on the
one below it: and instead of stairs on the sloping face, a ramp wound
round the tower, as we are told was the case with the temple of Belus at
Babylon.The four lower storeys are still perfect: each of them is
richly panelled and  as above mentioned, and in some parts even
the parapet of the ramp still remains _in situ_.The three upper storeys
are gone, but may be easily restored from those below, as was done by M.
Place, as shown in the annexed woodcut.According to him, it was an
observatory, and had no cella on its summit.If this was the case it was
a Semitic temple, and belongs to a quite different religion from that
whose temples we have been describing.But unfortunately there is no
direct evidence to determine whether it had such a chamber or not.My
own impressions on the subject are decidedly at variance with those of
M. Place, but until some bas-reliefs are discovered containing
representations of these temples and of their cells, we shall probably
hardly ever know exactly what the form of the crowning member really
was.From the imitations in modern times we seem to see dimly that it
was conical, and possibly curvilinear.The dimensions of this tower at
Khorsabad were, 150 feet square at the base and 135 high from the
pavement to the platform on its summit.Its base, however, was at a
considerable elevation above the plain, so that when seen from below it
must have been an imposing object.Observatory at Khorsabad, from Places ‘Ninive et
l’Assyrie.’ Scale 50 ft.The inscriptions at Borsippa and elsewhere mention other temples of the
same class, and no doubt those of Babylon were more magnificent than any
we have yet found; but they must always have been such prominent
objects, and the materials of which they were composed so easily
removed, that it is doubtful if anything more perfect will now be found.The Mujelibé, described by Rich, and afterwards explored without success
by Layard, is probably the base of the great temple of Belus described
by the Greeks; but even its dimensions can now hardly be ascertained, so
completely is it ruined.It seems, however, to be a parallelogram of
about 600 feet square,[73] and rising to a height of about 140 feet; but
no trace of the upper storeys exist, nor indeed anything which would
enable us to speak with certainty of the form of the basement itself.If
this is the height of the basement, however, analogy would lead us to
infer that the six storeys rose to a height of about 450 feet; and with
the ziggurah or sikra on their summit, the whole height may very well
have been the stadium mentioned by Strabo.[74]

As before mentioned, p.158, we have fortunately in the tomb of Cyrus at
Pasargadæ (Woodcuts Nos.84-86) a stone copy of these temples; in this
instance, however, so small that it can hardly be considered as more
than a model, but not the less instructive on that account.Like the
Birs Nimroud, the pyramid consists of six storeys: the three upper of
equal height, in this instance 23½ inches; the next two are equal to
each other, and, as in the Birs Nimroud, in the ratio of 26 to 15, or 41
inches.The basement is equal to the three upper put together, or 5 ft.9 in., making a total of 18 ft.[75] The height of the cella is
equal to the height of the basement, but this may be owing to the small
size of the whole edifice, it being necessary to provide a chamber of a
given dimension for the sepulchre.In the larger temples, it may be
surmised that the height was divided into four nearly equal parts; one
being given to the basement, one to the two next storeys, one to the
three upper storeys, and the fourth to the chamber on the summit.There is one other source from which we may hope to obtain information
regarding these temples, and that is, the bas-reliefs on the walls of
the Assyrian palaces.They drew architecture, however, so badly, that it
is necessary to be very guarded in considering such representations as
more than suggestions; but the annexed woodcut (No.54) does seem to
represent a four-storeyed temple, placed on a mound, with very tolerable
correctness, and if the upper storey had not been broken away the
drawing might have given us a valuable hint as to the form and purposes
of the cella, which was the principal object of the erection.Its
colouring, too, is gone; but the certain remains of symbolical colours
at Borsippa and Khorsabad confirm so completely the Greek accounts of
the seven- walls of Ecbatana that with the other indications of
the same sort extant that branch of the inquiry may be considered as
complete.(From a Bas-relief from
Koyunjik.)]It is to be hoped that now that the thread is caught, it will be
followed up till this form of temple is thoroughly investigated; for to
the philosophical student of architectural history few recent
discoveries are of more interest.There hardly seems a doubt but that
many temples found further eastward are the direct lineal descendants of
these Babylonian forms, though we as yet can only pick up here and there
the missing links of the chain of evidence which connects the one with
the other.We know, however, that Buddhism is essentially the religion
of a Turanian people, and it has long been suspected that there was some
connection between the Magi of Central Asia and the priests of that
religion, and that some of its forms at least were elaborated in the
valley of the Euphrates.If the architectural investigation is fully
carried out, I feel convinced we shall be able to trace back to their
source many things which hitherto have been unexplained mysteries, and
to complete the history of this form of temple and of the religion to
which it belonged, from the Bowariyeh at Wurka, built 2000 years B.C.,
to the Temple of Heaven erected in the city of Pekin within the limits
of the present century.Elevation of a portion of the external Wall of Wuswus
at Wurka (From Loftus.)]The only exception to the class of temple mounds found in Chaldea is the
ruin of Wuswus, at Wurka,[76] which seems to partake of the character of
a palace.Whether it is or not is by no means clear, as the interior is
too much ruined for its plan to be traced with certainty, and its date
cannot be fixed from any internal evidence.Some of the bricks used in
its construction bear the name of Sin Shada 1700 B.C., but it is
suspected they may have been brought from an older edifice.The same
sort of panelling was used by Sargon at Khorsabad 1000 years after the
assumed date; and panelling very like it is used even in the age of the
Pyramids (Woodcuts Nos.11 and 12), 1000 years at least before that
time.With more knowledge we may recognise minor features which may
enable us to discriminate more exactly, but at present we only know that
this class of panelling was used for the adornment of external walls
from the earliest ages down at least to the destruction of Babylon.It
was probably used with well-marked characteristics in progression of
style; but these we have yet to ascertain.Externally the Wuswus is a
parallelogram 256 ft.Like almost every building in the
Euphrates valley in those ancient times, instead of the sides facing the
cardinal points of the compass, as was the case in Egypt in the Pyramid
age, the angles point towards them.In this case the entrance is in the
north-east face.The centre apparently was occupied by a court; and
opposite the entrance were two larger and several smaller apartments,
the larger being 57 ft.The great interest of the building lies
in the mode in which the external walls were ornamented (Woodcuts Nos.These were plastered and covered by an elaborate series of
reedings and square sinkings, forming a beautiful and very appropriate
mode of adorning the wall of a building that had no external openings.Elevation of Wall at Wurka (From the Report of the
Assyrian Excavation Fund.)]This system is carried still further in a fragment of a wall in the same
city, but of uncertain date.In this instance these reedings—there are
no panels in the smaller fragment—and the plain surfaces are ornamented
by an elaborate mosaic of small cones about 3 or 3½ in.The butt
or thicker end of these is dipped in colour, and they are then built up
into patterns as shown in the woodcut No.It is probable that the
walls of the Wuswus were adorned with similar patterns in colours, but
being executed in less durable materials, have perished.Indeed, from
the accounts which we have, as well as from the remains, we are
justified in asserting that this style of architecture depended for its
effect on colour as much, at least, if not more, than on form.Could
colour be made as permanent this might frequently be wise, but too great
dependence on it has deprived us of half the knowledge we might
otherwise possess of the architectural effects of other times.Shalmaneser I. founded Nimroud                      B.C.1290

All the knowledge which we in reality possess regarding the ancient
palatial architecture of the Euphrates valley[77] is derived from the
exploration of the palaces erected by the great Assyrian dynasty of
Nineveh during the two centuries and a half of its greatest prosperity.Fortunately it is a period regarding the chronology of which there is no
doubt, since the discovery of the Assyrian Canon by Sir Henry
Rawlinson,[78] extending up to the year 900 B.C.: this, combined with
Ptolemy’s Canon, fixes the date of every king’s reign with almost
absolute certainty.It is also a period regarding which we feel more
real interest than almost any other in the history of Asia.Almost all
the kings of that dynasty carried their conquering arms into Syria, and
their names are familiar to us as household words, from the record of
their wars in the Bible.It is singularly interesting not only to find
these records so completely confirmed, but to be able to study the
actual works of these very kings, and to analyse their feelings and
aspirations from the pictures of their actions and pursuits which they
have left on the walls of their palaces.From the accounts left us by the Greeks we are led to suppose that the
palaces of Babylon were superior in beauty and magnificence to those of
Nineveh; and, judging from the extent and size of the mounds still
remaining there, it is quite possible that such may have been the case;
but they are so completely ruined, and have been so long used as
quarries, that it is impossible to restore, even in imagination, these
now formless masses.One thing seems nearly certain, which is, that no stone was used in
their construction.If, consequently, their portals were adorned with
winged bulls or lions, they must have been in stucco.If their walls
were covered with scenes of war or the chase, as those of Nineveh, they
must have been painted on plaster; so that, though their dimensions may
have been most imposing and their splendour dazzling, they must have
wanted the solidity and permanent character so essential to true
architectural effect.It is the employment of stone which alone has enabled us to understand
the arrangements of the Assyrian palaces.Had not their portals been
marked by their colossal genii, we should hardly have known where to
look for them; and if the walls of their apartments had not been
wainscoted with alabaster slabs, we should never have been able to trace
their form with anything like certainty.Practically, all we know of
Assyrian art is due to the fact of their having so suitable a material
as alabaster close at hand, and to the skill with which they knew how to
employ it.Had their walls only been plastered, the mounds of Khorsabad
and Nimroud would have remained as mysterious now as they were before
Layard and Botta revealed to us their splendours.Notwithstanding the wonderful results that were achieved in the ten or
twelve years during which the Assyrian explorations were pursued with
activity, it is by no means impossible but that much more still remains
to reward an energetic and skilful research in these mounds.Still,
seven palaces have been more or less perfectly exhumed; four at Nimroud,
two at Koyunjik, and one at Khorsabad.Among these we have the palaces
of Sennacherib and Sardanapalus, of Esarhaddon, Sargon, Shalmaneser, and
probably of Tiglath Pileser.Consequently the palaces of all the great
kings, whose names are so familiar to us, are laid bare.Beyond these,
the palace of Asshur-bani-pal worthily commences the series before the
kings of Assyria came into contact with the inhabitants of Syria, and
consequently before their Biblical record begins.It may be that other
works of the same kings may be discovered, or the buildings of some less
celebrated monarch, but if we do not know all that is to be known, we
may rest assured that we already have acquired the greater part of the
knowledge that is to be obtained from these explorations.The oldest of the buildings hitherto excavated in Assyria is the
North-West Palace at Nimroud, built by Asshur-bani-pal, about the year
884 B.C.Though not the largest, it more than makes up for this
deficiency by the beauty of its sculptures and the general elegance of
its ornaments.As will be seen by the annexed woodcut (No.58), the
excavated portion of the palace is nearly a square, about 330 ft.The principal entrance was on the north, at the head of a noble
flight of steps leading from the river to the level of the terrace on
which the palace stood.From this, two entrances, adorned with winged
bulls, led to a great hall, 152 ft.in length by 32 in width, at the
upper end of which was situated the throne, and at the lower a smaller
apartment or vestibule opened on the terrace that overlooked the river.Within the great hall was one of smaller dimensions, opening into the
central court of the palace, the entrance of which was so arranged as to
ensure privacy, proving that it partook of the nature of the private
apartment or hareem of the palace.To the eastward of this was a suite
of apartments, three deep, decreasing in width as they receded from the
light, but so arranged that the inner apartments must have been entirely
dark had the walls been carried to the ceiling.As will, however, be
presently explained in describing Khorsabad, it is more than probable
that the walls extended to only half the height of the rooms, and formed
terraces with dwarf pillars on their summits, between which light was
introduced, and they in fact formed the upper storey of the building.To
the south was a double suite, apparently the banqueting halls of the
palace; and to the westward a fourth suite, more ruined, however, than
the rest, owing to its being situated so near the edge of the terrace.As far as can be made out, the rooms on this face seem to have been
arranged three deep: the outer opening on the terrace by three portals,
the central one of which had winged bulls, but the lateral seem to have
been without these ornaments; the whole façade being about 330 ft.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, showing the excavations
as they were left by M. Botta.All these apartments were lined with sculptured slabs, representing
mostly either the regal state of the sovereign, his prowess in war, or
amusements during peace, but many of them were wholly devoted to
religious subjects.Beyond these apartments were many others, covering
at least an equal extent of ground, but their walls having been only
plastered and painted, the sun-burnt bricks of which they were built
have crumbled again to their original mud.It is evident, however, that
they were inferior to those already described, both in form and size,
and applied to inferior purposes.The mound at Nimroud was so much extended after this palace was built,
and so covered by subsequent buildings, that it is now impossible to
ascertain either the extent or form of this, which is the only palace of
the older dynasty known.It will therefore perhaps be as well to turn at
once to Khorsabad, which, being built wholly by one king, and not
altered afterwards, will give a clearer idea of the position and
arrangements of an Assyrian palace than we can obtain from any one on
the Nimroud mound.It has besides this the advantage of being the only
one so complete and so completely excavated as to enable us to form a
correct idea of what an Assyrian palace really was and of all its
arrangements.[80]

The city of Khorsabad was situated about fifteen miles from Nineveh, in
a northerly direction, and was nearly square in plan, measuring about an
English mile each way.Nearly in the centre of the north-western wall
was a gap, in which was situated the mound on which the palace stood.It
seems to have been a peculiarity common to all Assyrian palaces to be so
situated.Their builders wisely objected to being surrounded on all
sides by houses and walls, and at the same time sought the protection of
a walled enclosure to cover the gateways and entrances to their palaces.At Koyunjik and Nimroud the outer face of the palace was covered and
protected by the river Tigris; and here the small brook Kausser flows
past the fort, and, though now an insignificant stream, it is by no
means improbable that it was dammed up so as to form a lake in front of
the palace when inhabited.This piece of water may have been further
deepened by excavating from it the earth necessary to raise the mound on
which the palace stood.That part of the mound in this instance which projected between the
walls was a square of about 650 ft.above
the level of the plain, and protected on every side by a supporting wall
cased with stone of very beautiful masonry (Woodcut No.Behind
this, and inside the city, was a somewhat lower mound, about 300 ft.in length, on which were situated the great
portals of the palace, together with the stables and offices, and,
outside the walls of the palace properly so called, the hareem.All the principal apartments of the palace properly so called were
revêted with sculptural slabs of alabaster, generally about 9 ft.in
height, like those at Nimroud; these either represent the wars or the
peaceful amusements of King Sargon, commemorate his magnificence, or
express his religious feelings.The great portals that gave access to the palace of Khorsabad from the
city were among the most magnificent of those yet discovered.The façade
in which they stood presented a frontage of 330 ft., in which were three
portals; the central one flanked by great human-headed bulls 19 ft.in
height, and on each side two other bulls 15 ft.high, with a giant
strangling a lion between them, as shown in the woodcut (No.62),
representing what still remained of them when uncovered by M. Botta, and
now forming one of the principal ornaments of the British Museum.These
portals were reached from the city by a flight of steps, now entirely
destroyed, but which there can be little difficulty in restoring from
what we find at Persepolis and elsewhere.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, as completely excavated
by M. Place.These portals led to the great outer court of the palace, measuring 315
ft.by 280 between the buttresses with which it was adorned all round.On the right hand were six or seven smaller courts surrounded by the
stables and outhouses of the palace, which were approached by a ramp on
the outside, at the head of which was a block of buildings containing
the cellarage, and generally the stores of eatables.On the left hand of
this court were the metal stores, each room having been appropriated to
iron, copper, or other such materials, and behind them, outside the
palace, was the hareem.[81]

In the northern angle, a rather insignificant passage formed a means of
communication between this great outer court and the next, which was 360
ft.long by 200 wide, and probably open to the country, at least in
front of the great portals.On the inner side of this second court a
magnificent portal opened into what appears to have been the residential
portion of the palace, measuring nearly 300 by 500 ft.Existing Remains of Propylæa at Khorsabad.]The proper entrance to this court was by the ramp before alluded to,
which was indeed the only access to the palace for chariots and
horsemen.From the second court, through the only vaulted passage in the
palace, access was obtained to the state apartments looking over the
country.The three principal of these are shown to a larger scale in the
woodcut (No.64) is a restored section of these apartments, showing what
their arrangement was, and the mode in which it is conceived they were
roofed, according to the information gathered on the spot, and what we
find afterwards practised at Persepolis and elsewhere.[82]

[Illustration: 63.Enlarged Plan of the Three Principal Rooms at
Khorsabad.It will be observed that the area covered by the walls is of nearly the
same extent as that of the rooms themselves, so that the galleries
formed in fact an upper storey to the palace; and thus, in the heat of
the day, the thickness of the walls kept the inner apartments free from
heat and glare, while in the evenings and mornings the galleries formed
airy and light apartments, affording a view over the country, and open
on every side to the breezes that at times blow so refreshingly over the
plains.It will also be observed that by this arrangement the direct
rays of the sun could never penetrate into the halls themselves, and
that rain, or even damp, could easily be excluded by means of curtains
or screens.Restored Section of Principal Rooms at Khorsabad.Restoration of Northern Angle of Palace Court,
Khorsabad.The whole of these state-rooms were revêted with sculptured alabaster
slabs, as shown in the section; above which the walls were decorated
with conventional designs painted on stucco, remains of which were found
among the débris.The external face of this suite, as seen from the north-eastern court,
was probably something very like what is shown in the woodcut (No.66),
though there are less materials for restoring the exterior than there
are for the internal parts of the palace.The arched entrance to the
court, shown on the left, is certain: so also, I conceive, is the mode
in which the light was introduced into the apartments.The details of
the pillars are not so certain, though not admitting of much latitude of
doubt.As before mentioned, outside the palace stood the hareem, of a somewhat
irregular form, but measuring 400 ft.by 280, (on left of plan, woodcut
No.The whole of its external walls are adorned with reeded
pilasters and panels like those of the Wuswus at Wurka (Woodcut No.61),
which is not the case with any other part of the palace.It has only one
small external opening from the terrace, and another, which may be
called a concealed one, from the great outer court.Internally its
arrangements are very remarkable.First there is an outer court into
which these two entrances open, and within that two other courts, on
whose side are extended what may be called three complete suites of
apartments, very similar to each other in arrangement, though varied in
dimensions.It looks as if each was appropriated to a queen, and that
their relative magnificence accorded with the dignity of the person to
whom it was assigned.But are we justified in assuming that Sargon had
three queens, and only that number of legitimate wives?Assuming this,
however, there is still room in this hareem for any number of concubines
and their attendants.The central court of the hareem is one of the richest discoveries that
rewarded M. Place’s industry.It was adorned with six free-standing
statues—the smaller court with two—and the walls were wainscoted with
enamelled tile representing the king, his vizier, lions, eagles, vines
and fruits, and other objects in a bright yellow colour on a blue
ground.The whole is, in fact, one of the most curious and interesting
discoveries yet made in these palaces.As it can hardly admit of a doubt that this was really the hareem of the
palace, it is curious that such a building as the observatory described
above (p.162), should have been erected in its immediate proximity.Every one ascending the ramp or standing on its summit must have looked
into its courts, unless they were covered with awnings or roofs in some
manner we do not quite understand; and we can hardly assume that such a
tower was intended as the praying place of the king and the king only.The fact is undoubted, however we may explain it.From the above description it will be observed that in every case the
principal part, the great mass, of the palace was the terrace on which
it stood, which was raised by artificial means to a height of 30 ft.and
more, and, as shown in the illustration (Woodcut No.60), carefully
revêted with stone.On this stood the palace, consisting principally of
one great block of private apartments situated around an inner square
court.From this central mass two or three suites of apartments
projected as wings, so arranged as to be open to the air on three sides,
and to give great variety to the outline of the palace as seen from
below, and great play of light and shade in every aspect under which the
building could be surveyed.So far also as we can judge, the whole
arrangements were admirably adapted to the climate, and the ornaments
not only elegant in themselves, but singularly expressive and
appropriate to the situations in which they are found.Another most important discovery of M. Place is that of the great arched
gates of the city.These were apparently always constructed in pairs—one
for the use of foot-passengers, the other for wheeled carriages, as
shown by the marks of wheels worn into the pavement in the one case,
while it is perfectly smooth in the other.Those appropriated to carriages had plain jambs rising perpendicularly
12 or 15 ft.These supported a semicircular arch, 18 ft.in diameter,
adorned on its face with an archivolt of great beauty, formed of blue
enamelled bricks, with a pattern of figures and stars of a warm yellow
colour, relieved upon it.The gateways for foot-passengers were nearly of the same dimensions,
about 14 or 15 ft.broad, but they were ornamented by winged bulls with
human heads, between which stood giants strangling lions.In the example
illustrated in the annexed woodcut (No.67), the arch sprang directly
from the backs of the bulls, and was ornamented by an archivolt similar
to that over the carriage entrances, and which is perhaps as beautiful a
mode of ornamenting an arch as is to be found anywhere.Other arches have been found in these Assyrian excavations, but none of
such extent as these, and none which show more completely how well the
Assyrians in the time of Sargon (721 B.C.)understood not only the
construction of the arch, but also its use as a decorative architectural
feature.[83]

[Illustration: 68.Interior of a Yezidi House at Bukra, in the Sinjar.]There must always be many points, even in royal residences, which would
be more easily understood if we knew the domestic manners and usages
prevalent among the common people of the same era and country.This
knowledge we actually can supply in the present case, to a great extent,
from modern Eastern residences.Such a mode of illustration in the West
would be out of the question; but in the East, manners and customs,
processes of manufacture and forms of building, have existed unchanged
from the earliest times to the present day.This immutability is the
greatest charm of the East, and frequently enables us to understand what
in our own land would have utterly faded away and been obliterated.In
the Yezidi house, for instance, borrowed from Mr.Layard’s work, we see
an exact reproduction, in every essential respect, of the style of
building in the days of Sennacherib.Here we have the wooden pillars
with bracket capitals, supporting a mass of timber intended to be
covered with a thickness of earth sufficient to prevent the rain or heat
from penetrating to the dwelling.There is no reason to doubt that the
houses of the humbler classes were in former times similar to that here
represented; and this very form amplified into a palace, and the walls
and pillars ornamented and carved, would exactly correspond with the
principal features of the palace of the great Assyrian king.PALACE OF SENNACHERIB, KOYUNJIK.Having said so much of Khorsabad, it will not be necessary to say much
about the palace at Koyunjik, built by Sennacherib, the son of the
Khorsabad king.As the great metropolitan palace of Nineveh, it was of course of far
greater extent and far more magnificent than the suburban palace of his
father.The mound itself on which it stands is about 1½ mile in
circumference (7800 ft.); and, as the whole was raised artificially to
the height of not less than 30 ft., it is in itself a work of no mean
magnitude.The principal palace stood at the south-western angle of this mound, and
as far as the excavation has been carried seems to have formed a square
of about 600 ft.each way—double the lineal dimensions of that at
Nimroud.Its general arrangements were very similar to those at
Khorsabad, but on a larger scale.It enclosed within itself two or three
great internal courts, surrounded with sixty or seventy apartments, some
of great extent.The principal façade, facing the east, surpassed any of
those of Khorsabad, both in size and magnificence, being adorned by ten
winged bulls of the largest dimensions, with a giant between each of the
two principal external ones, in the manner shown in the woodcut (No.62), besides smaller sculptures—the whole extending to a length of not
less than 350 ft.The principal façade at Khorsabad, as above mentioned,
extended 330 ft., but the bulls and the portals there were to those at
Koyunjik in the proportion of 30 to 40, which nearly indeed expresses
the relative magnificence of the two palaces.Inside the great portal at
Koyunjik was a hall, 180 ft.in length by 42 in width, with a recess at
each end, through which access was obtained to two courtyards, one on
the right and one on the left; and beyond these to the other and
apparently the more private apartments of the palace, which overlooked
the country and the river Tigris, flowing to the westward of the
palace—the principal entrance, as at Khorsabad, being from the city.[84]

It is impossible, of course, to say how much further the palace
extended, though it is probable that nearly all the apartments which
were revêted with sculptures have been laid open; but what has been
excavated occupies so small a portion of the mound that it is impossible
to be unimpressed with the conviction that it forms but a very small
fraction of the imperial palace of Nineveh.Judging even from what has
as yet been uncovered, it is, of all the buildings of antiquity, alone
surpassed in magnitude by the great palace-temple at Karnac; and when we
consider the vastness of the mound on which it was raised, and the
richness of the ornaments with which it was adorned, a doubt arises
whether it was not as great, or at least as expensive, a work as the
great palace-temples of Thebes.The latter, however, were built with far
higher motives, and designed to last through ages, while the palace at
Nineveh was built only to gratify the barbaric pride of a wealthy and
sensual monarch, and perished with the ephemeral dynasty to which he
belonged.PALACE OF ESARHADDON.Another Assyrian palace, of which considerable remains still exist, is
that of Esarhaddon, commonly known as the South-west Palace at Nimroud.Like the others, this too has been destroyed by fire, and the only part
that remains sufficiently entire to be described is the entrance or
southern hall.in
width, and it consequently is the largest hall yet found in Assyria.The
architects, however, either from constructive necessities or for
purposes of state, divided it down the centre by a wall supporting dwarf
columns,[85] forming a central gallery, to which access was had by
bridge galleries at both ends, a mode of arrangement capable of great
variety and picturesqueness of effect, and of which there is little
doubt that the builders availed themselves to the fullest extent.This
led into a courtyard of considerable dimensions, surrounded by
apartments, but they are all too much destroyed by fire to be
intelligible.Another great palace, built, as appears from the inscriptions, by a son
of Esarhaddon, has been discovered nearly in the centre of the mound at
Koyunjik.Its terrace-wall has been explored for nearly 300 ft.in two
directions from the angle near which the principal entrance is placed.lower than the palace itself, which is reached
by an inclined passage nearly 200 ft.in length, adorned with sculpture
on both sides.The palace itself, as far as its exploration has been
carried, appears similar in its arrangements to those already described;
but the sculptures with which it is adorned are more minute and
delicate, and show a more perfect imitation of nature, than the earlier
examples, though inferior to them in grandeur of conception and breadth
of design.The architectural details also display a degree of elegance and an
amount of elaborate finish not usually found in the earlier examples, as
is well illustrated by the Woodcut No.71, representing one of the
pavement slabs of the palace.It is of the same design, and similarly
ornamented, but the finish is better, and the execution more elaborate,
than in any of the more ancient examples we are acquainted with.Besides these, there were on the mound at Nimroud a central palace built
by Tiglath Pileser, and one at the south-eastern angle of the mound,
built by a grandson of Esarhaddon; but both are too much ruined for its
being feasible to trace either their form or extent.Around the great
pyramid, at the north-west angle of the mound, were buildings more
resembling temples than any others on it—all the sculptures upon them
pointing apparently to devotional purposes, though in form they differed
but little from the palaces.At the same time there is certainly nothing
in them to indicate that the mound at the base of which they were
situated was appropriated to the dead, or to funereal purposes.Between
the north-west and south-west palaces there was also raised a terrace
higher than the rest, on which were situated some chambers, the use of
which it is not easy to determine.Pavement Slab from the Central Palace, Koyunjik.]Notwithstanding the impossibility that now exists of making out all the
details of the buildings situated on the great mounds of Nimroud and
Koyunjik, it is evident that these great groups of buildings must have
ranked among the most splendid monuments of antiquity, surrounded as
they were by stone-faced terraces, and approached on every side by noble
flights of stairs.When all the palaces with their towers and temples
were seen gay with colour, and crowded with all the state and splendour
of an Eastern monarch, they must have formed a scene of such dazzling
magnificence that one can easily comprehend how the inhabitants of the
little cities of Greece or Judea were betrayed into such extravagant
hyperbole when speaking of the size and splendour of the great cities of
Assyria.Pavilion, from the Sculptures at Khorsabad.]The worst feature of all this splendour was its ephemeral
character—though perhaps it is owing to this very fact that we now know
so much about it—for, like the reed that bends to the storm and recovers
its elasticity, while the oak is snapped by its violence, these relics
of a past age have retained to some extent their pristine beauty.Had
these buildings been constructed like those of the Egyptians, their
remains would probably have been applied to other purposes long ago; but
having been overwhelmed so early and forgotten, they have been preserved
to our day; nor is it difficult to see how this has occurred.The
pillars that supported the roof being of wood, probably of cedar, and
the beams on the under side of the roof being of the same material,
nothing was easier than to set fire to them.The fall of the roofs,
which were probably composed, as at the present day, of five or six feet
of earth, and which is requisite to keep out heat as well as wet, would
alone suffice to bury the building up to the height of the sculptures.The gradual crumbling of the thick walls consequent on their unprotected
exposure to the atmosphere would add three or four feet to this: so that
it is hardly too much to suppose that green grass might have been
growing over the buried palaces of Nineveh before two or three years had
elapsed from the time of their destruction and desertion.When once this
had taken place, the mounds afforded far too tempting positions not to
be speedily occupied by the villages of the natives; and a few centuries
of mud-hut building would complete the process of entombment so
completely as to protect the hidden remains perfectly for the centuries
during which they have lain buried.These have now been recovered to
such an extent as enables us to restore their form almost as certainly
as we can those of the temples of Greece or Rome, or of any of the great
nations of antiquity.Assyrian Temple, North Palace, Koyunjik.Bas-relief, representing façade of Assyrian Palace.It is by no means improbable that at some future period we may be able
to restore much that is now unintelligible, from the representations of
buildings on the sculptures, and to complete our account of their style
of architecture from illustrations drawn by the Assyrians themselves.One or two of these have already been published.The annexed woodcut,
for instance (No.72), of a bas-relief representing a little
fishing-pavilion on the water’s edge, exhibits in a rude manner all the
parts of an Assyrian order with its entablature, and the capital only
requires to be slightly elongated to make it similar to those found at
Persepolis.Another from the North Palace, Koyunjik, repeats the same arrangement,
with pillars which must be considered as early examples of the
Corinthian order, and, if we may trust the drawing, it likewise
represents an aqueduct with horizontally constructed arches of pointed
form.74) from the same palace seems intended to
portray a complete palace façade, with its winged bulls in the entrance
and its colossal lions on the front.Above these animals, but not
apparently meant to be represented as resting on them, are pillars in
antis, as in the two previous illustrations.[86] Unfortunately the
cornice is broken away, and the whole is more carelessly executed than
is usual in these sculptures.Exterior of a Palace, from a Bas-relief at Koyunjik.]75) is that of a palace of
two storeys, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik, showing a range of openings
under the roof in both storeys, each opening being divided into three
parts by two Ionic columns between square piers, and are probably meant
to represent such an arrangement as that shown in Woodcuts Nos.On the right the upper storey is a correct representation of the
panelled style of ornamentation above alluded to as recently discovered
at Khorsabad and elsewhere, and which we know from recent discoveries to
have been so favourite a mode of decorating walls in that age.The most remarkable fact, however, that we gather from all these
illustrations is, that the favourite arrangement was a group of pillars
“distyle in antis,” as it is technically termed, viz., two circular
pillars between two square piers.It is frequently found elsewhere in
the façade of tombs, but here it seems to have been repeated over and
over again to make up a complete design.For a temple such an
arrangement would have been inadmissible: for a palace it seems
singularly appropriate and elegant.(From Bas-relief, British Museum.)]Further comparisons will no doubt do much to complete the subject; and
when the names written over these bas-reliefs are definitively
deciphered, we may find that we really possess contemporary
representations, if not of Jerusalem, at least of Lachish, of Susa, and
other cities familiar to us both from ancient and from modern history.Horse-Tent (Nimroud).]We have no representation of the dwellings of private individuals so
complete as to enable us to understand them, but there are several of
royal camps which are interesting.Among the most curious of these are
the representations of the tents of the king and his nobles.One of
these is shown in Woodcut No.76, though how it was constructed is by no
means clear.It seems to have been open in the centre to the air, but
covered at either end by a sort of hood so arranged as to catch the
passing breeze, and afford protection from rain at the same time.The
annexed woodcut (No.77), representing the front and one side of the
royal horse-tent, gives a good idea of the luxury and elegance that was
carried into the detail even of subordinate structures.Except the Chaldean-formed temples, which have been described in the
previous chapter, there are no religious edifices sufficiently complete
to enable us to form a distinct idea of what the architectural
arrangements of these temples were.As belonging to a Semitic people we
should expect them to be few and insignificant.So little remains of the temple at Khorsabad, that it is difficult to
say what its original form may have been; the terrace, however, which
supported it is interesting, as it shows almost the only instance of a
perfect Assyrian moulding or cornice betraying a similarity to the forms
of Egyptian architecture which we do not find elsewhere.The curve,
however, is not exactly that of an Egyptian cornice, being continued
beyond the vertical tangent; but this may have arisen from the terrace
being only six feet in height, which placed the curve below the line of
sight, and so required a different treatment from one placed so high
above it as is usually the case in Egypt.Elevation of Stylobate of temple.]The bas-relief on the next page is perhaps the best sculptured
representation that exists of what we might fancy an Assyrian temple to
have been.The emblem so enshrined is probably the Asheerah, or grove,
to the worship of which the Israelites at all times showed such a
tendency to relapse, and is one of the most frequent objects of
adoration among the Assyrians.As a Semitic people we should hardly expect to find any tombs among
them, and indeed, unless the pyramid at the north-west angle of the
Nimroud mound is the tomb of Sardanapalus, mentioned by the Greeks,[87]
it is not clear that a single Assyrian sepulchre has yet been
discovered.Those that crowd and choke the ruins of Wurka and Mugheyr
and other cities of Babylonia are the remains of a Turanian people who
always respected their dead, and paid especial attention to the
preservation of their bodies.The pyramid at Nimroud seems to have been
explored with sufficient care to enable us to affirm that no stairs or
inclined plane led to its summit, and without these it certainly was not
one of those observatory temples before alluded to.Still, it is so
singular to have one monument, and one only, of its class, that it is
difficult to form a satisfactory opinion on the subject.It stands at the north-west angle of the mound, and measures 167 ft.in height, is composed of beautiful stone
masonry, ornamented by buttresses and offsets, above which the wall was
continued perpendicularly in brickwork.In the centre of the building,
and on the level of the base or terrace, a long vaulted gallery or
tunnel was discovered, but it contained no clue to the destination of
the building.Sacred Symbolic Tree of the Assyrians.(From Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone.)](From Layard’s ‘Nineveh.’)]

The whole now rises to a height of about 120 ft.from the plain, and is
composed of sun-dried bricks, with courses of kiln-burnt bricks between
them, at certain intervals towards the summit, which render it probable
that it originally was not a pyramid in the usual sense of the term, but
a square tower, rising in three or four storeys, each less than the
lower one, as in the traditional temple of Belus at Babylon, or like the
summit of the obelisk represented in the woodcut (No.81), which most
probably is a monolithic reproduction of such a sepulchral tower as
this, rather than an obelisk like those of Egypt.Other obelisks have since been discovered, some of which look even more
like miniature models of structural buildings than this one does.Till further information is obtained, it will hardly be possible to say
much that is satisfactory with regard to either the tombs, temples, or
minor antiquities of the Assyrian people.Their architecture was
essentially Palatial—as that of the Greeks was Templar—and to that alone
our remarks might almost be confined.Fortunately, however, sculpture
was another art to which they were specially addicted, and to their
passion for this we owe most of our knowledge of their manners and
customs.To this art also we are indebted for our ability to restore
many details of their palaces and buildings, which without its aid would
have been altogether unintelligible.Judged by the same rules of criticism which we apply to Classic or
Mediæval art, the architecture of the Assyrians must, it is feared, rank
very low.But for gorgeous Barbaric splendour of effect it seems
difficult to imagine anything that could well have been grander or more
imposing than the palaces of Nineveh must have been when entire and
filled with the state and magnificence of the monarchs of the Assyrian
empire.Cyrus founds Pasargadæ                                     B.C.560

There still remains a third chapter to write before the survey of the
architecture of the central region of Asia is complete—before indeed a
great deal which has just been assumed can become capable of proof.By a
fortunate accident the Persians used stone where the Assyrians used only
wood, and consequently many details of their architecture have come down
to our day which would otherwise have passed away had the more
perishable materials of their predecessors been made use of.Whatever else the ancient world may owe to the learning of the
Egyptians, it seems certain that they were the first to make use of
stone as a constructive building material.As before mentioned, the
Egyptians used a stone Proto-Doric pillar at least 1000 years before the
Greeks or the Etruscans, or any other ancient people we know of, dreamt
of such a thing.The Babylonians and Assyrians never seem to have used
stone constructively, except as the revêtement of a terrace wall; and it
was not till after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses that we find any
Asiatic nations using a pillar of stone in architecture, or doing more
than building a wall, or heaping mass on mass of this material without
any constructive contrivance.The Indians first learned this art from
the Bactrian Greeks, and many civilised Asiatic nations still prefer
wood for their palaces and temples, as the Assyrians did, and only use
stone as “a heap.” It must have been difficult, however, for any
intelligent people to visit the wonderful stone temples of Thebes and
Memphis without being struck by their superior magnificence and
durability; and we consequently find the Persians on their return,
though reproducing their old forms, adopting the new material, which,
fortunately for them and for our history, was found in abundance in the
neighbourhood of their capitals.Even, however, on the most cursory inspection, it is easy to see how
little the arts of the Assyrians were changed by their successors.The
winged lions and bulls that adorn the portals at Persepolis are
practically identical with those of Nineveh.The representations of the
king on his throne with his attendants are so similar, that but for the
locality it would require considerable knowledge to discriminate between
Sennacherib and Xerxes.The long procession of tribute bearers—the
symbolical animals slain by the king; the whole ornamentation, in fact,
is so slightly altered from what existed in Assyria, that we are
startled to find how little change in these sculptures the new dynasty
had introduced; and if this is the case with them, and their position
and arrangement are nearly identical, we may feel very certain that the
architecture was also the same.It appears at first sight to have been otherwise; but on closer
examination it appears quite certain that this even is due more to the
material employed than to any alteration in form.Something may be due
to the fact that the buildings we now find on the platform at Persepolis
may have been dedicated to somewhat different purposes than were those
of Nineveh; but even this is not quite clear.If the great square courts
of the Ninevite palaces were roofed over, as Layard suggested—and as
probably was the case—they would exactly represent the square halls of
Persepolis.But as all the intermediate buildings of sun-dried brick
have been washed off the bare rock by the winter rains of Persia, we can
only speculate on what they might have been, without daring to lay too
much stress on our convictions.In their present state the remains at Pasargadæ are, perhaps, more
interesting to the antiquary than to the architect, the palaces on the
plain being so ruined that their architectural arrangements cannot be
understood or restored.Elevation of Platform at Pasargadæ.]On the side of a hill overlooking the plain is a platform of masonry
(Woodcut No.82) which originally supported either a temple or
fire-altar, but this has now entirely disappeared, and the structure is
only remarkable for the beauty of its masonry and the large dimensions
of the stones with which it is built.83), not only at their joints but often on their faces, with the same
flat sinking as is found in all the Jewish works at Jerusalem, and
sometimes in Greek buildings of the best age.Thus an ornament of great
beauty and elegance is formed out of what would otherwise be merely a
plain mass of masonry.The tomb of Cyrus has already been referred to (p.164) as a copy in
stone of one of the ziggurats or terrace-temples.But it must be borne
in mind that the most celebrated example of this form is as often called
the tomb, as the temple of Belus;[88] and among a Turanian people the
tomb and the temple may be considered as one and the same thing.The
tomb is surrounded on three sides[89] by a portico of columns standing
14 feet apart: no stone capitals have been found, but it is probable
that the columns carried wooden bracket-capitals to diminish the bearing
of the wooden architrave or beam which supported the roof.Beyond the
portico there are the traces of a second enclosure 25 feet wide, which,
from its width, was probably an open court.(From Texier’s ‘Arménie et la
Perse.’)]

On the plain are the remains of buildings, three of which were palaces,
and one the ruin of a tomb.The plan of one of them, called the palace
of Cyrus, has been measured and published by M. Texier, MM.Flandin &
Coste, and M. Dieulafoy, and although the restoration given by the
latter goes somewhat farther than the remains will account for, there
are certain features in which they all agree, and which show that it
contained at least two porches or porticoes and a great hall of columns
not dissimilar from the examples found at Persepolis.The angle piers or
responds of two porticoes still exist in situ; on one of them in the
upper stone is cut the socket in which the architrave of the portico
rested, the form of this socket having a peculiar value, as it shows
more clearly than the socket in the respond of the portico of the palace
of Darius, that the Persian architrave was composed of two or more beams
placed one over the other, and overhanging, as in the tomb of Darius.A
second pier has an inscription which enables us to ascribe its erection
to Cyrus.A column, 34 feet high, of the great hall still remains, which
shows that at all events in this case the central hall rose above the
porticoes, deriving its light therefore through clerestory windows.No
capitals have been found,[90] and it is possible therefore they were in
wood, as we have suggested may have been the case in the portico of the
tomb of Cyrus.Plan of Tomb of Cyrus, Pasargadæ.To the east of this palace, and distant about 170 yards, are the remains
of a second palace with a hall of columns, and measuring 124 by 49 ft.,
and on the west side of it is the stone jamb of a doorway similar to
those at Persepolis, and carved with the well-known bas-relief of Cyrus.The third palace has been excavated by Mr.Weld Blundell, and the
foundations of its walls traced, measuring 187 by 131 ft., with a hall
of 24 columns.At Nineveh, as we have seen, all the pillars, the roofs, and the
constructive parts of the building, which were of wood,[91] have
disappeared, and left nothing but the massive walls, which, falling and
being heaped the one on the other, have buried themselves and their
ornaments till the present day.At Persepolis, on the contrary, the
brick walls, being thinner and exposed on the bare surface of the naked
rock, have been washed away by the storms and rains of 2000 years,
leaving only the skeletons of the buildings.In the rocky country of
Persia, however, the architect fortunately used stone; and we have thus
at Persepolis, if the expression may be used, all the bones of the
building, but without the flesh; and at Nineveh, the flesh, but without
the bones that gave it form and substance.View from top of Great Stairs at Persepolis.]The general appearance of the ruins, as they at present stand, will be
seen from the woodcut (No.[92] The principal mass in the foreground
on the left is the Propylæa of Xerxes, and behind that and to the right
stand the pillars of the Chehil Minar, or Great Hall of Xerxes.Between
these are seen in the distance the remains of the smaller halls of
Darius and Xerxes.The most striking features in this view are the staircases that led from
the plain to the platform, and from the lower level to that on which the
great hall stood.Indeed, among these ruins, nothing is more remarkable
than these great flights of steps.The builders of those days were, so
far as we know, the only people who really understood the value of this
feature.The Egyptians seem wholly to have neglected it, and the Greeks
to have cared little about it; but it was not so at Nineveh, where, so
far as we can understand from the indistinct traces left, the stairs
must have been one of the most important parts of the design.But they
were so situated that they were not buried when the buildings were
ruined, and consequently have been removed.At Jerusalem, too, we read
that when the Queen of Sheba saw “the ascent by which Solomon went up to
the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.” Indeed, in all
the ancient temples and palaces of this district, more attention is paid
to this feature than to almost any other; and from their favourable
situation on artificial terraces, the builders were enabled to apply
their stairs with far more effect than any others in ancient or in
modern times.The lower or great staircase at Persepolis is plain, and without any
sculpture, but is built of the most massive Cyclopean masonry, and of
great width and very easy acclivity.That in front of the great hall is
ornamented with sculpture, in three tiers, representing the people of
the land bringing presents and the subject nations tribute, to lay at
the feet of the monarch, combined with mythological representations; the
whole bearing a very considerable resemblance to the sculptures on the
walls of the Assyrian palaces, though the position is different.The
arrangement of these stairs, too, is peculiar, none of them being at
right angles to the buildings they approach, but all being double,
apparently to permit of processions passing the throne, situated in the
porches at their summit, without interruption, and without altering the
line of march.One of these flights, leading to the platform of Xerxes’ palace, is
shown in the woodcut (No.In arrangement it is like the stairs
leading to the great terrace, but very much smaller, and is profusely
adorned with sculpture.The principal apartment in all the buildings situated on the platform is
a central square hall, the floor of which is studded with pillars placed
equidistant the one from the other.The smallest have 4 pillars, the
next 16, then 36, and one has 100 pillars on its floor; but to avoid
inventing new names, we may call these respectively, distyle,
tetrastyle, hexastyle, and decastyle halls, from their having 2, 4, 6,
or 10 pillars on each face of the phalanx, and because that is the
number of the pillars in their porticoes when they have any.The building at the head of the great stairs is a distyle hall, having 4
pillars supporting its roof.On each side of the first public entrance
stands a human-headed winged bull, so nearly identical with those found
in Assyrian palaces as to leave no doubt of their having the same
origin.At the opposite entrance are two bulls without wings, but drawn
with the same bold, massive proportions which distinguish all the
sculptured animals in the palaces of Assyria and Persia.The other, or
palace entrance, is destroyed, the foundation only remaining; but this,
with the foundations of the walls, leaves no room to doubt that the
annexed woodcut (No.89) is a true representation of its
ground-plan.[93] Nor can it be doubted that this is one of those
buildings so frequently mentioned in the Bible as a “gate,” not the door
of a city or buildings, but a gate of justice, such as that where
Mordecai sat at Susa—where Abraham bought his field—where Ruth’s
marriage was judged of—and, indeed, where public business was generally
transacted.There are three other distyle halls or gates on the platform: one to the
westward of this, very much ruined; one in the centre of the whole
group, which seems to have had external porticoes; and a third on the
platform in front of the palace of Xerxes.There are two tetrastyle halls, one of which, erected by Darius (woodcut
No.90), is the most interesting of the smaller buildings on the
terrace.It is the only building that faces the south, and is approached
by a flight of steps, represented with the whole façade of the palace as
it now stands in the woodcut (No.These steps led to a tetrastyle
porch, two ranges in depth, which opened into the central hall with its
16 columns, around which were arranged smaller rooms or cells, either
for the occupation of the king, if it was a palace, or of the priests if
a temple.In the western side a staircase and doorway were added,
somewhat unsymmetrically, by Artaxerxes.These remains would hardly suffice to enable us to restore the external
appearance of the palace; but fortunately the same king who built the
palace for his use on this mound, repeated it in the rock as an “eternal
dwelling” for himself after death.The tomb known as that of Darius at
Naksh-i-Rustam (woodcut No.92), is an exact reproduction, not only of
the architectural features of the palace, but to the same scale, and in
every respect so similar, that it seems impossible to doubt but that the
one was intended as a literal copy of the other.Assuming it to be so,
we learn what kind of cornice rested on the double bull capitals.And
what is still more interesting, we obtain a representation of a prayer
platform, which we have described elsewhere as a Talar,[94] but the
meaning of which we should hardly know but for this representation.The other tetrastyle hall is similar to this, but plainer and somewhat
smaller.Façade of Palace of Darius at Persepolis.Turning from these to the hexastyle halls, the smallest but most perfect
(Woodcut No.91) is that standing on the southern edge of the upper
platform, the inscriptions on which certainly prove it to have been
built by Xerxes.Tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustam, representing the
façade of his Palace surmounted by a Talar.]The platform on which it stands is approached by two flights of steps,
that on the east being the one represented in the woodcut No.84,—there
are also indications of a tetrastyle hall or gate having existed on its
summit,—while that to the west is much simpler.The hall itself had a
portico of 12 columns, and on each side a range of smaller apartments,
the two principal of which had their roof supported by 4 pillars each.The building is one of great beauty in itself, but its greatest value is
that it enables us to understand the arrangement of the great hall of
Xerxes—the Chehil Minar—the most splendid building of which any remains
exist in this part of the world.94)
it will be seen that the arrangement of the whole central part is
identical with that of the building just described.There can be no
possible doubt about this, as the bases of all the 72 columns still
exist in situ, as well as the jambs of the two principal doorways, which
are shaded darker in the plan.The side and rear walls only are restored
from the preceding illustration.The only difference is, that instead of
the two distyle halls on either side, this had hexastyle porticoes of 12
pillars each, similar to that in front; the angles between which were in
all probability filled up with rooms or buildings, as suggested in the
plan.[95]

[Illustration: 94.Restored Plan of Great Hall of Xerxes at Persepolis.Two orders of pillars were employed to support the roof of this splendid
building; one, represented in Woodcut No.91, with double bull capitals,
like those of the porch of Darius’s palace.in
height from the floor to the back of the bull’s neck, or 64 ft.to the
under side of the beam that lay between the bulls.The other order, with
the Ionic volutes (woodcut No.96), was also that employed in the
northern portico, and generally in the interior throughout this
building, and is nearly identical, as far as the base and shaft are
concerned, except in the height of the latter.The capital, however,
differs widely, and is 16 ft.in height, making an order
altogether 9 ft.less than that used externally, the difference
being made up by brackets of wood, which supported the beams of the
roof, internally at least, though externally the double bull capital
probably surmounted these Ionic-like scrolls.There is no reason to doubt that these halls also had platforms or
talars like the smaller halls, which would also serve to shelter any
opening in the roof, though in the present instance it seems very
doubtful if any such openings or skylights existed or were indeed
required.Thus arranged, the section of the buildings would be as shown in the
woodcut (No.97); and presuming this structure to have been sculptured
and painted as richly as others of its age and class, which it no doubt
was, it must have been not only one of the largest, but one of the most
splendid buildings of antiquity.In plan it was a rectangle of about 300
ft.by 350, and consequently covered 105,000 square ft.; it was thus
larger than the hypostyle hall at Karnac, or any of the largest temples
of Greece or Rome.It is larger, too, than any mediæval cathedral except
that of Milan; and although it has neither the stone roof of a
cathedral, nor the massiveness of an Egyptian building, still its size
and proportions, combined with the lightness of its architecture and the
beauty of its decorations, must have made it one of the most beautiful
buildings ever erected.Both in design and proportion it far surpassed
those of Assyria, and though possessing much of detail or ornament that
was almost identical, its arrangement and proportions were so superior
in every respect that no similar building in Nineveh can be compared
with this, the great architectural creation of the Persian Empire.There is no octastyle hall at Persepolis, and only one decastyle.In
this instance the hall itself measured about 225 ft.each way, and had
100 pillars on its floor; still, it was low in proportion, devoid of
lateral porticoes, and consequently by no means so magnificent a
building as the great hall of Xerxes.The portico in front was two
ranges in depth, and flanked by gigantic bulls; but as the whole height
was barely 25 ft., it could not have been a remarkable or pleasing
object.The sculptures on the jambs of the doorways are the most
interesting part of this building; these represent the king on his
throne, and various mythological subjects, on a more extensive scale
than those similarly situated in the other buildings of the platform.Indeed, it is probable that in the other palaces these subjects were
painted on the internal walls, as was done in those Assyrian halls which
were not revêted with slabs.With an appropriateness that cannot be too
much praised, sculpture seems always to have been used in parts of the
building exposed to atmospheric injury, and, because of the exposure, to
have been employed there in preference to painting.Besides these buildings on the platform there are the remains of several
others on the plain, and within the precincts of the town of Istakr is a
building still called the Hareem of Jemsheed, and which may in reality
have been the residence of the Achæmenian kings.It certainly belongs to
their age, and from the irregularity of its form, and its general
proportions, looks very much more like a residence, properly so called,
than any of the monumental erections on the neighbouring platform of
Persepolis.Looked at from an architectural point of view the principal defect of
the interior arrangement, especially of the smaller Persepolitan halls,
is that their floor is unnecessarily crowded with pillars.As these had
to support only a wooden roof, some might have been dispensed with, or a
more artistic arrangement have been adopted.This would no doubt have
been done but for the influence of the Assyrian style, in which frequent
pillars were indispensable to support the heavy flat roofs, and as they
were of timber a greater number were required than would have been the
case if of stone.Those of wood also looked less cumbersome and less in
the way than those made of more durable materials.It is also a defect that the capitals of the pillars retain at
Persepolis so much of the form of their wooden prototypes.In wood such
capitals as those depicted (Woodcuts No.In stone they are clumsy; and the Greeks showed their usual
discrimination when they cut away all the volutes but one pair and
adopted a stone construction for the entablature.Notwithstanding these defects, there is a grandeur of conception about
the Persepolitan halls which entitles them to our admiration.Their
greatest point of interest to the architectural student consists
probably in their being examples of a transition from a wooden to a
stone style of art, and in their enabling us to complete and understand
that art which had been elaborated in the valley of the Euphrates during
previous centuries; but which, owing to the perishable nature of the
materials employed, has almost wholly passed away, without leaving
sufficient traces to enable all its characteristics to be understood or
restored.Loftus at Susa in 1850 laid bare the foundations
of a palace almost identical both in plan and dimensions with the Chehil
Minar at Persepolis.It was, however, much more completely ruined, the
place having long been used as a quarry by the inhabitants of the
neighbouring plains, so that now only the bases of the pillars remain in
situ, with fragments of the shafts and capitals strewed everywhere
about, but no walls or doorways, or other architectural members to
enable us to supply what is wanting at Persepolis.Restored Elevation of Capital at Susa.The bases seem to be of the same form and style as those at Persepolis,
but rather more richly carved.The capitals are also more elaborate, but
more essentially wooden in their form, and betray their origin not only
in the exuberance of their carving but also in the disproportion of the
capital to the shaft.In wood so large a capital does not look
disproportioned to so slender a shaft; in stone the effect is most
disagreeable, and was to a certain extent remedied at Persepolis so soon
as the result was perceived.Whether the Persians would ever have been
able to shake off entirely the wooden original is not quite clear, but
the Greeks, being bound by no such association, cut the knot at once,
and saved them the trouble.In 1885, M. Marcel Dieulafoy turned his attention to the excavations as
left by Loftus, and conceiving the idea that the principal entrance
should be sought for on the south side of the palace, he cut his
trenches in a north-east direction and discovered the traces of the
walls enclosing the court in front of the palace.These walls were faced
with enamelled beton blocks.Portions of these enamels had disappeared,
but sufficient remained, as the walls had fallen on their faces, to
allow of their being placed in their relative positions.From these
fragments M. Dieulafoy was able to put together a frieze of lions not
dissimilar to those found in the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad, with
decorative borders above and below, the whole crowned by a battlement,
also in enamelled colours.The lower portion of the wall was covered
with unglazed bricks of two colours, red and white, arranged in diaper
patterns.Continuing the trench, M. Dieulafoy discovered the great
staircase placed at the south side of the tumulus, a staircase of even
greater dimensions than the well-known example of Persepolis.Loftus’s researches had already proved that the palace consisted of a
central hall of thirty-six columns, with three porticoes of twelve
columns, similar, therefore, to the great hall of Xerxes.M. Dieulafoy’s
discoveries have shown that the central hall was enclosed with a wall,
thus confirming the late Mr.Fergusson’s theory as to the restoration of
the palace of Xerxes (see p.On the east side leading to the royal
entrance of the great hall, M. Dieulafoy discovered the remains of the
great frieze of archers (Woodcut No.99), now in the Louvre; these were
executed in bright enamelled colours on beton bricks.The figures, which
are about 5 ft.in height, are modelled in low relief, arrayed in
processional order, each man grasping a lance in his hand and carrying,
slung on his shoulder, a bow and quiver full of arrows.The shape of
each man’s dress is the same, but the colours and patterns alternate; in
one case the dress is studded with rosettes, in the other with squares
containing the earliest heraldic device known, a representation of three
towers on a hill.These enamels, as also those of the lions and of fragments of the
crenelated staircase, are now all in the Louvre, and retain sufficient
of their pristine effect to suggest a scheme of colour and of decorative
treatment of the greatest beauty.[96] The inscriptions round the bases
of the pillars had already informed us that the hall was erected by
Darius and Xerxes, but repaired and restored by Artaxerxes Mnemon, who
added the inscriptions.This has been confirmed by another inscription
under the lions on the pylons; these M. Dieulafoy attributes to Xerxes,
as fragments of enamelled bricks of burnt clay, and not beton, and
therefore of an earlier building, have been utilised as a filling-in.In
all probability the hall of this palace is the identical hall in which
the scenes described in the Book of Esther took place.The foundations
of other parts of this palace might be no doubt laid bare by further
excavations; but the ruin of the place has been so complete, that little
of interest in an architectural point of view can be looked for.Below
these Persian ruins are probably buried the remains of long-preceding
dynasties, which deeper excavations would lay bare, and which would in
all probability afford a rich harvest to the historical explorer.Near the town of Istakr, and opposite the tombs of Naksh-i-Rustam,
stands a small tower-like building, represented in Woodcut No.The
lower part is solid; the upper contains a small square apartment, roofed
by two great flat slabs of stone.Access to this chamber is obtained by
a doorway situated at some distance from the ground.Both the traditions of the place and the knowledge we have of their
religious practices point to this as one of the fire temples of the
ancient Persians.Its roof is internally still black, probably with the
smoke of ancient fires, and though simple and insignificant as an
architectural monument, it is interesting as the only form of a temple
apart from regal state which the ancient Persians possessed.Another, almost identical in form, is found at Pasargadæ,[97] and a
third exists (according to Stolze) near Maubandajan, at the foot of the
Kuh Pir-i-mard, eleven miles to east of Fasa.Perrot suggests it may
have been the tomb of Hytaspes, father of Darius.The celebrated Kaabah
at Mecca, to which all the Moslem world now bow in prayer, is probably a
fourth, while the temple represented in Woodcut No.81, from Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone, may be a representation of such a structure as
these, with its curtains and paraphernalia complete.It is too evident,
however, that the Persians were not a temple-building people,[98] and
the examples that have come down to our time are too few and too
insignificant on which to found any theory.Little requires to be said of the tombs of the Persians; that of Darius
is represented in plan and elevation in Woodcut No.92, and, as before
remarked, it is a literal copy on the rock of the façade of his palace.Internally, three small cells contained the remains of the king, with
those of the persons, probably his favourite wife or wives for whom he
had destined that honour.Close by this, at Naksh-i-Rustam, are four
others, and in the rock behind Persepolis are three more tombs of the
Achæmenian kings, identical with these in all essential respects; but
still with such a difference in workmanship and detail as would enable a
careful architectural student easily to detect a sequence, and so affix
to each, approximately at least, the name of the king whose sepulchre it
is.Unfortunately, that of Darius only is inscribed; but his position in
the dynasty is so well known, that, starting from that point, it would
be easy to assign each of these tombs to the king who excavated it for
his own resting-place.Although these tombs of the Achæmenians are not remarkable for their
magnificence, they are interesting in an architectural point of view,
inasmuch as—as pointed out above—they enable us to restore their
structural buildings in a manner we would hardly be able to do without
their assistance.They are also interesting ethnographically as
indicating that these kings of Persia were far from being the pure
Aryans the language of their inscriptions would lead us to suspect they
might be.There are not, so far as is yet known, any series of rock-cut
sepulchres belonging to any dynasty of pure Aryan blood.Nor would any
king of Semitic race attempt anything of the sort.Their evidence,
therefore, as far as it goes—and it is tolerably distinct—seems to prove
that the Achæmenian kings were of Turanian race.They only, and not any
of their subjects in Persia, seem to have adopted this style of
grandeur, which, as we shall presently see, was common in Asia Minor,
and other countries subject to their sway, but who were of a different
race altogether.CHAPTER V.

                         INVENTION OF THE ARCH.Before leaving this early section of architecture, it may be as well
briefly to refer to the invention of the true arch, regarding which
considerable misconception still exists.It is generally supposed that the Egyptians were ignorant of the true
principles of the arch, and only employed two stones meeting one another
at a certain angle in the centre when they wished to cover a larger
space than could conveniently be done by a single block.This, however,
seems to be a mistake, as many of the tombs and chambers around the
pyramids and the temples at Thebes are roofed by stone and brick arches
of a semicircular form, and perfect in every respect as far as the
principles of the arch are concerned.Several of these have been drawn by Lepsius, and are engraved in his
work; but, as no text accompanies them, and the drawings are not on a
sufficient scale to make out the hieroglyphics, where any exist, their
date cannot now be ascertained.Consequently, these examples cannot yet
be used as the foundation of any argument on the subject, though the
curved form of the roofs in the Third Pyramid would alone be sufficient
to render it more than probable that during the period of the 4th
dynasty the Egyptians were familiar with this expedient.[99]

At Beni-Hasan, during the time of the 12th dynasty, curvilinear forms
reappear in the roofs (Woodcut No.16), used in such a manner as to
render it almost certain that they are copied from roofs of arcuate
construction.Behind the Rameseum at Thebes there are a series of arches
in brick, which seem undoubtedly to belong to the same age as the
building itself; and Sir G. Wilkinson mentions a tomb at Thebes, the
roof of which is vaulted with bricks, and still bears the name of
Amenoph I., of the 18th dynasty.[100]

The temple at Abydus, erected by Rameses II., shows the same peculiarity
as the tombs at Beni-Hasan, of a flat segmental arch thrown across
between the stone architraves.In this instance it is also a copy in
stone, but such as must have been originally copied from one of brick
construction.There is also every reason to believe that the apartments
of the little pavilion at Medeenet Habû (Woodcuts Nos.32 and 33) were
covered with semicircular vaults, though these have now
disappeared.Hoskins found stone arches vaulting the roofs of the
porches to the pyramids, perfect in construction, and, what is still
more singular, showing both circular and pointed forms (Woodcut No.These, as before remarked, are probably of the time of Tirhakah,
or at all events not earlier than the age of Solomon, nor later than
that of Cambyses.Section of Tomb near the Pyramids of Gizeh.]In the age of Psammeticus we have several stone arches in the
neighbourhood of the pyramids; one, in a tomb at Sakkara, has been
frequently drawn; but one of the most instructive is that in a tomb
discovered by Colonel Campbell (Woodcut No.101), showing a very
primitive form of an arch composed of 3 stones only, and above which is
another arch of regular construction of 4 courses.In his researches at
Nimroud, Layard discovered vaulted drains and chambers below the
north-west and south-east edifices, which were consequently as old as
the 8th or 9th century before our era, and contemporary with those in
the pyramids of Meroë.They were of both circular and pointed forms, and
built apparently with great care and attention to the principles of the
arch (Woodcut No.Vaulted Drain beneath the South-East Palace at
Nimroud.]The great discovery of this class is that of the city gates at
Khorsabad, which, as mentioned at p.181, were spanned by arches of
semicircular form, so perfect both in construction and in the mode in
which they were ornamented, as to prove that in the time of Sargon the
arch was a usual and well-understood building expedient, and one
consequently which we may fairly assume to have been long in use.Arch at Dêr-el-Bahree.On the other hand, we have in the temple at Dêr-el-Bahree in Thebes,
built by Thothmes III., a curious example of the retention of the old
form, when at first sight it would appear as though the true arch would
have been a more correct expedient.In this example, the lower arch is
composed of stones bracketing forward horizontally, though the form of
the arch is semicircular; and above this is a discharging arch of two
stones used as in the Pyramids.The upper arch is so arranged as to
relieve the crown of the lower—which is its weakest part—of all weight,
and at the same time to throw the whole pressure on the outer ends of
the arch stones, exactly where it is wanted.The whole thus becomes
constructively perfect, though it is a more expensive way of attaining
the end desired than by an arch.The truth seems to be, the Egyptians had not at this age invented
voussoirs deeper in the direction of the radii of the arch than in that
of its perimeter; and the arch with them was consequently not generally
an appropriate mode of roofing.It was the Romans with their tiles who
first really understood the true employment of the arch.So far as we can now understand from the discoveries that have been
made, it seems that the Assyrians used the pointed arch for tunnels,
aqueducts, and generally for underground work where they feared great
superincumbent pressure on the apex, and the round arch above-ground
where that was not to be dreaded; and in this they probably showed more
science and discrimination than we do in such works.Arch of the Cloaca Maxima, Rome.In Europe the oldest arch is probably that of Cloaca Maxima at Rome,
constructed under the early kings.It is of stone in 3 rims, and shows
as perfect a knowledge of the principle as any subsequent example.Its
lasting uninjured to the present day proves how well the art was then
understood, and, by inference, how long it must have been practised
before reaching that degree of perfection.From all this it becomes almost certain that the arch was used as early
as the times of the pyramid-builders of the 4th dynasty, and was copied
in the tombs of Beni-Hasan in the 12th; though it may be that the
earliest existing example cannot be dated further back than the first
kings of the 18th dynasty; from that time, however, there can be no
doubt that it was currently used, not only in Egypt, but also in
Ethiopia and Assyria.It would, indeed, be more difficult to account for the fact of such
perfect builders as the Egyptians being ignorant of the arch if such
were the case; though, at the same time, it is easy to understand why
they should use it so sparingly, as they did in their monumental
erections.Even in the simplest arch, that formed of only two stones, such as is
frequently found in the pyramids, and over the highest chamber (Woodcut
No.8), it will be evident that any weight placed on the apex has a
tendency to lower the summit, and press the lower ends of the stones
outwards.Where there was the whole mass of the pyramid to abut against,
this was of no consequence, but in a slighter building it would have
thrust the walls apart, and brought on inevitable ruin.The introduction of a third stone, as in the arch (Woodcut No.101),
hardly remedied this at all, the central stone acting like a wedge to
thrust the two others apart; and even the introduction of 2 more stones,
making 5, as in Woodcut No.105, only distributed the pressure without
remedying the defect; and without the most perfect masonry every
additional joint was only an additional source of weakness.Arches in the Pyramids at Meroë.This has been felt by the architects of all ages and in all countries:
still, the advantage of being able to cover large spaces with small
stones or bricks is so great, that many have been willing to run the
risk; and all the ingenuity of the Gothic architects of the Middle Ages
was applied to overcoming the difficulty.But even the best of their
buildings are unstable from this cause, and require constant care and
attention to keep them from falling.The Indian architects have fallen into the other extreme, refusing to
use the arch under any circumstances, and preferring the smallest
dimensions and the most crowded interiors, to adopting what they
consider so destructive an expedient.As mentioned in the Introduction
(page 22), their theory is that “an arch never sleeps,” and is
constantly tending to tear a building to pieces: and, where aided by
earthquakes and the roots of trees, there is only too much truth in
their belief.The Egyptians seem to have followed a middle course, using arches either
in tombs, where the rock formed an immovable abutment; or in pyramids
and buildings, where the mass immensely overpowered the thrust; or
underground, where the superincumbent earth prevented movement.They seem also to have used flat segmental arches of brickwork between
the rows of massive architraves which they placed on their pillars; and
as all these abutted one another, like the arches of a bridge, except
the external ones, which were sufficiently supported by the massive
walls, the mode of construction was a sound one.This is exactly that
which we have re-introduced during the last 30 years, in consequence of
the application of cast-iron beams, between which flat segmental arches
of brick are thrown, when we desire to introduce a more solid and
fire-proof construction than is possible with wood only.In their use of the arch, as in everything else, the building science of
the Egyptians seems to have been governed by the soundest principles and
the most perfect knowledge of what was judicious and expedient, and what
should be avoided.Many of their smaller edifices have no doubt perished
from the scarcity of wood forcing the builders to employ brick arches,
but they wisely avoided the use of these in all their larger
monuments—in all, in fact, which they wished should endure to the latest
posterity.CHRONOLOGICAL MEMORANDA CONNECTED WITH ARCHITECTURE.Moses      B.C.1312

The Jews, like the other Semitic races, were not a building people, and
never aspired to monumental magnificence as a mode of perpetuating the
memory of their greatness.The palace of Solomon was wholly of cedar
wood, and must have perished of natural decay in a few centuries, if it
escaped fire and other accidents incident to such temporary structures.Their first temple was a tent, their second depended almost entirely on
its metallic ornaments for its splendour, and it was not till the Greeks
and Romans taught them how to apply stone and stone carving for this
purpose that we have anything that can be called architecture in the
true sense of the term.This deficiency of monuments is, however, by no means peculiar to the
Jewish people.As before observed, we should know hardly anything of the
architecture of Assyria but for the existence of the wainscot slabs of
their palaces, though they were nearly a purely Semitic people, but
their art rested on a Turanian basis.Neither Tyre nor Sidon have left
us a single monument; nor Utica nor Carthage one vestige that dates
anterior to the Roman period.What is found at Jerusalem, at Baalbec, at
Palmyra, or Petra, even in the countries beyond the Jordan, is all
Roman.What little traces of Phœnician art are picked up in the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean are copies, with Egyptian or
Grecian details, badly and unintelligently copied, and showing a want of
appreciation of the first principles of art that is remarkable in that
age.It is therefore an immense gain if by our knowledge of Assyrian art
we are enabled, even in a moderate degree, to realise the form of
buildings which have long ceased to exist, and are only known to us from
verbal descriptions.Diagram Plan of Solomon’s Palace.The most celebrated secular building of the Jews was the palace which
Solomon was occupied in building during the thirteen years which
followed his completion of the Temple.As not one vestige of this
celebrated building remains, and even its site is a matter of dispute,
the annexed plan must be taken only as an attempt to apply the knowledge
we have acquired in Assyria and Judea to the elucidation of the
descriptions of the Bible and Josephus,[102] and as such may be
considered of sufficient interest to deserve a place in the History of
Architecture.The principal apartment here, as in all Eastern palaces, was the great
audience hall, in this instance 150 feet in length by 75 in width; the
roof composed of cedar, and, like the Ninevite palaces, supported by
rows of cedar pillars on the floor.According to Josephus, who, however,
never saw it, and had evidently the Roman Stoa Basilica of the Temple in
his eye, the section would probably have been as shown in diagram A. But
the contemporary Bible narrative, which is the real authority, would
almost certainly point to something more like the Diagram B in the
annexed woodcut.Diagram Sections of the House of the Cedars of
Lebanon.]Next in importance to this was the Porch, which was the audience or
reception hall, attached to the private apartments; these two being the
Dewanni Aum and Dewanni Khas of Eastern palaces, at this day.The Hall
of Judgment we may venture to restore with confidence, from what we find
at Persepolis and Khorsabad; and the courts are arranged in the diagram
as they were found in Ninevite palaces.They are proportioned, so far as
we can now judge, to those parts of which the dimensions are given by
the authorities, and to the best estimate we can now make of what would
be most suitable to Solomon’s state, and to such a capital as Jerusalem
was at that time.From Josephus we learn that Solomon built the walls of this palace “with
stones 10 cubits in length, and wainscoted them with stones that were
sawed and were of great value, such as are dug out of the earth for the
ornaments of temples and the adornment of palaces.”[103] These were
ornamented with sculptures in three rows, but the fourth or upper row
was the most remarkable, being covered with foliage in relief, of the
most exquisite workmanship; above this the walls were plastered and
ornamented with paintings in colour: all of which is the exact
counterpart of what we find at Nineveh.From the knowledge we now possess of Assyrian palaces it might indeed be
possible to restore this building with fairly approximate correctness,
but it would hardly be worth while to attempt this except in a work
especially devoted to Jewish art.For the present it must suffice to
know that the affinities of the architecture of Solomon’s age were
certainly Assyrian; and from our knowledge of the one we may pretty
accurately realise the form of the other.TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM.Although not one stone remains upon another of the celebrated Temple of
Jerusalem, still, the descriptions in the Bible and Josephus are so
precise, that now that we are able to interpret them by the light of
other buildings, its history can be written with very tolerable
certainty.The earliest temple of the Jews was the Tabernacle, the plan of which
they always considered as divinely revealed to them through Moses in the
desert of Sinai, and from which they consequently never departed in any
subsequent erections.Its dimensions were for the cella, or Holy of
Holies, 10 cubits or 15 ft.cube; for the outer temple, two such cubes
or 15 ft.These were covered by the sloping roofs of the tent,
which extended 5 cubits in every direction beyond the temple itself,
making the whole 40 cubits or 60 ft.in length by 20 cubits or 30 ft.These stood within an enclosure 100 cubits long by 50 cubits
wide.[104]

[Illustration: 108.The Tabernacle, showing one half ground plan and one
half as covered by the curtains.]1015) built the Temple, he did not alter the
disposition in any manner, but adopted it literally, only doubling every
dimension.Thus the Holy of Holies became a cube of 20 cubits; the Holy
place, 20 by 40; the porch and the chambers which surrounded it 10
cubits each, making a total of 80 cubits or 120 ft.by 40 cubits or 60
ft., with a height of 30 as compared with 15, which was the height of
the ridge of the Tabernacle, and it was surrounded by a court the
dimensions of which were 200 cubits in length by 100 in width.Even with these increased dimensions the Temple was a very insignificant
building in size: the truth being that, like the temples of Semitic
nations, it was more in the character of a shrine or of a treasury
intended to contain certain precious works in metal.South-East View of the Tabernacle, as restored by
the Author.]The principal ornaments of its façade were two brazen pillars, Jachin
and Boaz, which seem to have been wonders of metal work, and regarding
which more has been written, and it may be added, more nonsense, than
regarding almost any other known architectural objects.The truth of the
matter appears to be that the translators of our Bibles in no instance
were architects, and none of the architects who have attempted the
restoration were learned as Hebrew scholars; and consequently the truth
has fallen to the ground between the two.A brazen pillar, however, 18
cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference—6 ft.in diameter—is an
absurdity that no brass-founder ever could have perpetrated.In the
Hebrew, the 15th verse reads: “He cast two pillars of brass, 18 cubits
was the height of the one pillar, and a line of 12 cubits encompassed
the other pillar.”[105] The truth of the matter seems to be that what
Solomon erected was a screen (chapiter) consisting of two parts, one 4
cubits, the other 5 cubits in height, and supported by two pillars of
metal, certainly not more than 1 cubit in diameter, and standing 12
cubits apart: nor does it seem difficult to perceive what purpose this
screen was designed to effect.As will be observed, in the restoration
of the Tabernacle (Woodcut No.109), the whole of the light to the
interior is admitted from the front.In the Temple the only light that
could penetrate to the Holy of Holies was from the front also; and
though the Holy place was partially lighted from the sides, its
principal source of light must have been through the eastern façade.In
consequence of this there must have been a large opening or window in
this front, and as a window was a thing that they had not yet learned to
make an ornamental feature in architectural design, they took this mode
of screening and partially, at least, hiding it.It becomes almost absolutely certain that this is the true solution of
the riddle, when we find that when Herod rebuilt the Temple in the first
century B.C., he erected a similar screen for the same purpose in front
of his Temple.Its dimensions, however, were one-third larger.It was 40
cubits high, and 20 cubits across, and it supported five beams instead
of two;[106] not to display the chequer-work and pomegranates of
Solomon’s screen, but to carry the Golden Vine, which was the principal
ornament of the façade of the Temple in its latest form.[107]

[Illustration: 110.Plan of Solomon’s Temple, showing the disposition of
the chambers in two storeys.]Although it is easy to understand how it was quite possible in metal
work to introduce all the ornaments enumerated in the Bible, and with
gilding and colour to make these objects of wonder, we have no examples
with which we can compare them, and any restoration must consequently be
somewhat fanciful.Still, we must recollect that this was the “bronze
age” of architecture.Homer tells us of the brazen house of Priam, and
the brazen palace of Alcinous; the Treasuries at Mycenæ were covered
internally with bronze plates; and in Etruscan tombs of this age metal
was far more essentially the material of decoration than carving in
stone, or any of the modes afterwards so frequently adopted.The altar
of the Temple was of brass.The molten sea, supported by twelve brazen
oxen; the bases, the lavers, and all the other objects in metal work,
were in reality what made the Temple so celebrated; and very little was
due to the mere masonry by which we should judge of a Christian church
or any modern building.No pillars are mentioned as supporting the roof, but every analogy
derived from Persian architecture, as well as the constructive
necessities of the case, would lead us to suppose they must have
existed, four in the sanctuary and eight in the pronaos.Plan of Temple at Jerusalem, as rebuilt by Herod.The temple which Ezekiel saw in a vision on the banks of the Chebar was
identical in dimensions with that of Solomon, in so far as naos and
pronaos were concerned.But a passage round the naos was introduced,
giving access to the chambers, which added 10 cubits to its dimensions
every way, making it 100 cubits by 60.The principal court, which
contained the Altar and the Temple properly so called, had the same
dimensions as in Solomon’s Temple; but he added, in imagination at
least, four courts, each 100 cubits or 150 ft.That on the east
certainly existed, and seems to have been the new court of Solomon’s
Temple,[108] and is what in that of Herod became the court of the
Gentiles.The north and south courts were never apparently carried out.They did not exist in Solomon’s Temple, and there is evidence to show
that they were not found in Zerubbabel’s.[109] That on the north-west
angle was the citadel of the Temple, where the treasures were kept, and
which was afterwards replaced by the Tower Antonia.View of the Temple from the East, as it appeared at
the time of the Crucifixion.When the Jews returned from the Captivity they rebuilt the Temple
exactly as it had been described by Ezekiel, in so far as dimensions are
concerned, except that, as just mentioned, they do not seem to have been
able to accomplish the northern and southern courts.The materials, however, were probably inferior to the original Temple;
and we hear nothing of brazen pillars in the porch, nor of the splendid
vessels and furniture which made the glory of Solomon’s Temple, so that
the Jews were probably justified in mourning over its comparative
insignificance.[110]

In the last Temple we have a perfect illustration of the mode in which
the architectural enterprises of that country were carried out.The
priests restored the Temple itself, not venturing to alter a single one
of its sacred dimensions, only adding wings to the façade so as to make
it 100 cubits wide, and it is said 100 cubits high, while the length
remained 100 cubits as before.[111] At this period, however, Judea was
under the sway of the Romans and under the influence of their ideas, and
the outer courts were added with a magnificence of which former builders
had no conception, but bore strongly the impress of the architectural
magnificence of the Romans.An area measuring 600 feet each way was enclosed by terraced walls of
the utmost lithic grandeur.On these were erected porticoes unsurpassed
by any we know of.One, the Stoa Basilica, had a section equal to that
of our largest cathedrals, and surpassed them all in length, and within
this colonnaded enclosure were ten great gateways, two of which were of
surpassing magnificence: the whole making up a rich and varied pile
worthy of the Roman love of architectural display, but in singular
contrast with the modest aspirations of a purely Semitic people.It is always extremely difficult to restore any building from mere
verbal description, and still more so when erected by a people of whose
architecture we know so little as we do of that of the Jews.Still, the
woodcut on the opposite page is probably not very far from representing
the Temple as it was after the last restoration by Herod, barring of
course the screen bearing the Vine mentioned above, which is omitted.Without attempting to justify every detail, it seems such a mixture of
Roman with Phœnician forms as might be expected and is warranted by
Josephus’s description.There is no feature for which authority could
not be quoted, but the difficulty is to know whether or not the example
adduced is the right one, or the one which bears most directly on the
subject.After all, perhaps, its principal defect is that it does not
(how can a modern restoration?)do justice to the grandeur and beauty of
the whole.As it has been necessary to anticipate the chronological sequence of
events in order not to separate the temples of the Jews from one
another, it may be as well before proceeding further to allude to
several temples similarly situated which apparently were originally
Semitic shrines but rebuilt in Roman times.That at Palmyra, for
instance, is a building very closely resembling that at Jerusalem, in so
far at least as the outer enclosure is concerned.[112] It consists of a
cloistered enclosure of somewhat larger dimensions, measuring externally
730 ft.by 715, with a small temple of an anomalous form in the centre.It wants, however, all the inner enclosures and curious substructures of
the Jewish fane; but this may have arisen from its having been rebuilt
in late Roman times, and consequently shorn of these peculiarities.It
is so similar, however, that it must be regarded as a cognate temple to
that at Jerusalem, though re-erected by a people of another race.A third temple, apparently very similar to these, is that of Kangovar in
Persia.[113] Only a portion now remains of the great court in which it
stood, and which was nearly of the same dimensions as those of Jerusalem
and Palmyra, being 660 ft.In the centre are the vestiges of a
small temple.At Aizaini in Asia Minor[114] is a fourth, with a similar
court; but here the temple is more important, and assumes more
distinctly the forms of a regular Roman peristylar temple of the usual
form, though still small and insignificant for so considerable an
enclosure.The mosque of Damascus was once one of these great square
temple-enclosures, with a small temple, properly so called, in the
centre.It may have been as magnificent, perhaps more so, than any of
these just enumerated, but it has been so altered by Christian and
Moslem rebuildings, that it is almost impossible now to make out what
its original form may have been.None of these are original buildings, but still, when put together and
compared the one with the other, and, above all, when examined by the
light which discoveries farther east have enabled us to throw on the
subject, they enable us to restore this style in something like its
pristine form.At present, it is true, they are but the scattered
fragments of an art of which it is feared no original specimens now
remain, and which can only therefore be recovered by induction from
similar cognate examples of other, though allied, styles of art.Historical notice—Tombs at Smyrna—Doganlu—Lycian tombs.It is now perhaps in vain to expect that any monuments of the most
ancient times, of great extent or of great architectural importance,
remain to be discovered in Asia Minor; still, it is a storehouse from
which much information may yet be gleaned, and whence we may expect the
solution of many dark historical problems, if ever they are to be solved
at all.Situated as that country is, in the very centre of the old world,
surrounded on three sides by navigable seas opening all the regions of
the world to her commerce, possessing splendid harbours, a rich soil,
and the finest climate of the whole earth, it must not only have been
inhabited at the earliest period of history, but must have risen to a
pitch of civilisation at a time preceding any written histories that we
possess.We may recollect that, in the time of Psammeticus, Phrygia
contended with Egypt for the palm of antiquity, and from the monuments
of the 18th dynasty we know what rich spoil, what beautiful vases of
gold, and other tributes of a rich and luxurious people, the Pout and
Roteno and other inhabitants of Asia Minor brought and laid at the feet
of Thothmes and other early kings eighteen centuries at least before the
Christian era.At a later period (716 to 547 B.C.)the Lydian empire was one of the
richest and most powerful in Asia; and contemporary with this and for a
long period subsequent to it, the Ionian colonies of Greece surpassed
the mother country in wealth and refinement, and almost rivalled her in
literature and art.Few cities of the ancient world surpassed Ephesus,
Sardis, or Halicarnassus in splendour; and Troy, Tarsus, and Trebisond
mark three great epochs in the history of Asia Minor which are
unsurpassed in interest and political importance by the retrospect of
any cities of the world.Excepting, however, the remains of the Greek
and Roman periods—the great temples of the first, and the great theatres
of the latter period—little that is architectural remains in this once
favoured land.It happens also unfortunately that there was no great
capital city—no central point—where we can look for monuments of
importance.The defect in the physical geography of the country is that
it has no great river running through it—no vast central plain capable
of supporting a population sufficiently great to overpower the rest and
to give unity to the whole.Elevation of Tumulus at Tantalais.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’) 100 ft.Plan and Section of Chamber in Tumulus at
Tantalais.]So far as our researches yet reach, it would seem that the oldest
remains still found in Asia Minor are the tumuli of Tantalais, on the
northern shore of the Gulf of Smyrna.They seem as if left there most
opportunely to authenticate the tradition of the Etruscans having sailed
from this port for Italy.One of these is represented in Woodcuts Nos.Though these tumuli are built wholly of stone, no one
familiar with architectural resemblances can fail to see in them a
common origin with those of Etruria.The stylobate, the sloping sides,
the inner chamber, with its pointed roof, all the arrangements, indeed,
are the same, and the whole character of the necropolis at Tantalais
would be as appropriate at Tarquinii or Cæræ as at Smyrna.Another tumulus of equal interest historically is that of Alyattes, near
Sardis, described with such care by Herodotus,[115] and which was
explored 35 years ago by Spiegelthal, the Prussian consul at
Smyrna.[116] According to the measurements of Herodotus, it was either
3800 or 4100 ft.in circumference; at present it is found to be 1180 ft.in diameter, and consequently about 3700 ft.in circumference at the top
of the basement, though of course considerably more below.It is
situated on the edge of a rocky ridge, which is made level on one side
by a terrace-wall of large stones, 60 ft.in height; above this the
mound rises to the height of 142 ft.: the total height above the plain
being 228 ft.The upper part of the mound is composed of alternate
layers of clay, loam, and a kind of rubble concrete.These support a
mass of brickwork, surmounted by a platform of masonry; on this one of
the steles described by Herodotus still lies, and one of the smaller
ones was found close by.The funereal chamber was discovered resting on the rock at about 160 ft.high; the roof flat and composed of large stones, on which
rested a layer of charcoal and ashes, 2 ft.in thickness, evidently the
remains of the offerings which had been made after the chamber was
closed, but before the mound had been raised over it.There are in the same locality an immense number of tumuli of various
dimensions, among which Herr Spiegelthal fancies he can discriminate
three classes, belonging to three distinct ages; that of Alyattes
belonging to the most modern.This is extremely probable, as at this
time (B.C.561) the fashion of erecting tumuli as monuments was dying
out in this part of the world, though it continued in less civilised
parts of Europe till long after the Christian era.The tumuli that still adorn the Plain of Troy are probably contemporary
with the oldest of the three groups of those around the Gygean Lake.Indeed, there does not seem much reason for doubting that they were
really raised over the ashes of the heroes who took part in that
memorable struggle, and whose names they still bear.The recent explorations of these mounds do not seem to have thrown much
light on the subject, but if we can trust the account Chevalier gives of
his researches at the end of the last century, the case is clear enough,
and there can be very little doubt but that the Dios Tepe on the Sigæan
promontory is really the tomb of Achilles.[117] Intensely interesting
though they are in other respects, Schliemann’s discoveries on the site
of Troy have done very little to increase our knowledge of the
architecture of the period.This may partly be owing to his ignorance of
the art, and to his having no architect with him, but it does not appear
that any architectural mouldings were discovered earlier than those of
“Ilium Novum,” two or three centuries before Christ.The so-called
Temple of Minerva was without pillars or mouldings of any sort, and the
walls and gates of the old city were equally devoid of ornament.What
was found seems to confirm the idea that the Trojans were a
Turanian-Pelasgic people burying their dead in mounds, and revelling in
barbaric splendour, but not having reached that degree of civilisation
which would induce them to seek to perpetuate their forms of art in more
permanent materials than earth and metals.[118]


It is not clear whether any other great groups of tumuli exist in Asia
Minor, but it seems more than probable that in the earliest times the
whole of this country was inhabited by a Pelasgic race, who were the
first known occupants of Greece, and who built the so-called Treasuries
of Mycenæ and Orchomenos, and who sent forth the Etruscans to civilise
Italy.If this be so, it accounts for the absence of architectural
remains, for they would have left behind them no buildings but the
sepulchres of their departed great ones; and if their history is to be
recovered, it must be sought for in the bowels of the earth, and not in
anything existing above-ground.Next to these in point of age and style comes a curious group of
rock-cut monuments, found in the centre of the land at Doganlu.They are
placed on the rocky side of a narrow valley, and are unconnected
apparently with any great city or centre of population.Generally they
are called tombs, but there are no chambers nor anything about them to
indicate a funereal purpose, and the inscriptions which accompany them
are not on the monuments themselves, nor do they refer to such a
destination.Altogether they are certainly among the most mysterious
remains of antiquity, and, beyond a certain similarity to the rock-cut
tombs around Persepolis, present no features that afford even a remote
analogy to other monuments which might guide us in our conjectures as to
the purpose for which they were designed.They are of a style of art
clearly indicating a wooden origin, and consist of a square
frontispiece, either carved into certain geometric shapes, or apparently
prepared for painting; at each side is a flat pilaster, and above a
pediment terminating in two scrolls.Some—apparently the more
modern—have pillars of a rude Doric order, and all indeed are much more
singular than beautiful.When more of the same class are discovered,
they may help us to some historic data: all that we can now advance is,
that, judging from the inscriptions on them and the traditions in
Herodotus, they would appear to belong to some race from Thessaly, or
thereabouts, who at some remote period crossed the Hellespont and
settled in their neighbourhood; they may be dated as far back as 1000,
and most probably 700 years at least before the Christian Era.Rock-cut Frontispiece at Doganlu.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’)]

There are other rock-cut sculptures farther east, at Pterium and
elsewhere; but all these are figure sculptures, without architectural
form or details, and therefore hardly coming within the limits of this
work.The only remaining important architectural group in Asia Minor is that
of Lycia, made known in this country since the year 1838, by the
investigations of Sir Charles Fellows and others.Interesting though
they certainly are, they are extremely disheartening to any one looking
for earlier remains in this land,—inasmuch as all of them, and more
especially the older ones, indicate distinctly a wooden origin—more
strongly perhaps than any architectural remains in the Western world.The oldest of them cannot well be carried farther back than the Persian
conquest of Cyrus and Harpagus.In other words, it seems perfectly
evident that up to that period the Lycians used only wood for their
buildings, and that it was only at that time, and probably from the
Greeks or Egyptians, that they, like the Persians themselves, first
learnt to substitute for their frail and perishable structures others of
a more durable material.As already observed, the same process can be traced in Egypt in the
earliest ages.In Central Asia the change was effected by the Persians.In India between the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.In Greece—in what was
not borrowed from the Egyptians—the change took place a little earlier
than in Lycia, or say in the 7th century B.C.What is important to
observe here is that, wherever the process can be detected, it is in
vain to look for earlier buildings.It is only in the infancy of stone
architecture that men adhere to wooden forms; and as soon as habit gives
them familiarity with the new material they abandon the incongruities of
the style, and we lose all trace of the original form, which never
reappears at an after age.All the original buildings of Lycia are tombs or monumental erections of
some kind, and generally may be classed under two heads, those having
curvilinear and those having rectilinear roofs, of both which classes
examples are found structural—or standing alone—as well as rock-cut.It consists
first of a double podium, which may have been in all cases, or at least
generally, of stone.Above this is a rectangular chest or sarcophagus,
certainly copied from a wooden form; all the mortises and framing, even
to the pins that held them together, being literally rendered in the
stonework.Above this is a curvilinear roof of pointed form, which also
is in all its parts a copy of an original in wood.The staves or bearers of the lower portion of the chest or sarcophagus
would suggest that the original feature was a portable ark, the upper
portion of which was framed in bamboo or some pliable wood tied together
by cross timbers or purlins which are carved on the principal front.A
somewhat similar scheme of construction is shown in the Chaityas of the
Buddhist temples, which are supposed to have been copies of wooden
structures not dissimilar to the Toda Mant huts which are built by the
Hindus down to the present day.[119]

‘Lycia.’)]

[Illustration: 119.(From Sir Charles Fellows’s
work.)](From Texier’s ‘Asie
Mineure.’)]

When these forms are repeated in the rock the stylobate is omitted, and
only the upper part represented, as shown in the annexed woodcut (No.When the curvilinear roof is omitted, a flat one is substituted, nearly
similar to those common in the country at the present day, consisting of
beams of unsquared timber, laid side by side as close as they can be
laid, and over this a mass of concrete or clay, sufficiently thick to
prevent the rain from penetrating through.Sometimes this is surmounted
by a low pediment, and sometimes the lower framing also stands out from
the rock, so as to give the entrance of the tomb something of a
porchlike form.Both these forms are illustrated in the two woodcuts
(Nos.119 and 120), and numerous varieties of them are shown in the
works of Sir Charles Fellows and others, all containing the same
elements, and betraying most distinctly the wooden origin from which
they were derived.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

The last form that these buildings took was in the substitution of an
Ionic façade for these carpentry forms: this was not done apparently at
once, for, though the Ionic form was evidently borrowed from the
neighbouring Greek cities, it was only adopted by degrees, and even then
betrayed more strongly the wooden forms from which its entablature was
derived than is usually found in other or more purely Grecian examples.As soon as it had fairly gained a footing, the wooden style was
abandoned, and a masonry one substituted in its stead.The whole change
took place in this country probably within a century; but this is not a
fair test of the time such a process usually takes, as here it was
evidently done under foreign influence and with the spur given by the
example of a stone-building people.We have no knowledge of how long it
took in Egypt to effect the transformation.In India, where the form and
construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these
examples in Lycia, the process can be traced through five or six
centuries; and in Persia it took perhaps nearly as long to convert the
wooden designs of the Assyrians into even the imperfect stone
architecture of the Achæmenians.Even in their best and most perfect
buildings, however, much remained to be done before the carpentry types
were fairly got rid of and the style became entitled to rank among the
masonic arts of the world.The remaining ancient buildings of Asia Minor were all built by the
Greeks and Romans, each in their own style, so that their classification
and description belong properly to the chapters treating of the
architectural history of those nations, from which they cannot properly
be separated, although it is at the same time undoubtedly true that the
purely European forms of the art were considerably modified by the
influence on them of local Asiatic forms and feelings.The Ionic order,
for instance, which arose in the Grecian colonies on the coast, is only
the native style of this country Doricised, if the expression may be
used.In other words, the local method of building had become so
modified and altered by the Greeks in adapting it to the Doric, which
had become the typical style with them, as to cause the loss of almost
all its original Asiatic forms.It thus became essentially a stone
architecture with external columns, instead of a style indulging only in
wooden pillars, and those used internally, as there is every reason to
suppose was the earlier form of the art.The Ionic style, thus composed
of two elements, took the arrangement of the temples from the Doric, and
their details from the Asiatic original.The Roman temples, on the
contrary, which have been erected in this part of the world, in their
columns and other details exactly follow the buildings at Rome itself:
while, as in the instances above quoted of Jerusalem, Palmyra, Kangovar,
and others, the essential forms and arrangements are all local and
Asiatic.The former are Greek temples with Asiatic details, the latter
Asiatic temples with only Roman masonic forms.The Greeks, in fact, were
colonists, the Romans only conquerors; and hence the striking difference
in the style of Asiatic art executed under their respective influence.We shall have frequent occasion in the sequel to refer to this
difference.Though not strictly within the geographical limits of this chapter,
there is a group of tombs at Amrith—the ancient Marathos, on the coast
of Syria—which are too interesting to be passed over; but so exceptional
in the present state of our knowledge, that it is difficult to assign
them their proper place anywhere.The principal monument, represented in woodcut No.in height, composed of very large blocks of stone and situated over a
sepulchral cavern.There is no inscription or indication to enable us to
fix its date with certainty.[120] The details of its architecture might
be called Assyrian; but we know of nothing in that country that at all
resembles it.On the other hand there is a moulding on its base, which,
if correctly drawn, would appear to be of Roman origin; and there is a
look about the lions that would lead us to suspect they were carved
under Greek influence—after the age of Alexander at least.Elevation of the Monument and Section of the Tomb at
Amrith.[121])]

The interest consists in its being almost the only perfect survivor of a
class of monuments at one time probably very common; but which we are
led to believe from the style of ornamentation were generally in brick.It is also suggestive, from its close resemblance to the Buddhist topes
in Afghanistan and India; the tall form of those, especially in the
first-named country, and their universally domical outline, point
unmistakably to some such original as this: and lastly, were I asked to
point out the building in the old world which most resembled the stele
which Herod erected over the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem, in
expiation of his desecration of their sanctity,[122] this is the
monument to which I should unhesitatingly refer.(From
Wordsworth’s ‘Athens.’[123])]

Till within a very recent period the histories of Greece and Rome have
been considered as the ancient histories of the world; and even now, in
our universities and public schools, it is scarcely acknowledged that a
more ancient record has been read on the monuments of Egypt and dug out
of the bowels of the earth in Assyria.It is nevertheless true that the decipherment of the hieroglyphics on
the one hand, and the reading of the arrow-headed characters on the
other, have disclosed to us two forms of civilisation anterior to that
which reappeared in Greece in the 8th century before Christ.Based on
those that preceded it, the Hellenic form developed itself there with a
degree of perfection never before seen, nor has it, in its own peculiar
department, ever been since surpassed.These discoveries have been of the utmost importance, not only in
correcting our hitherto narrow views of ancient history, but in
assisting to explain much that was obscure, or utterly unintelligible,
in those histories with which we were more immediately familiar.We now,
for the first time, comprehend whence the Greeks obtained many of their
arts and much of their civilisation, and to what extent the character of
these was affected by the sources from which they were derived.Having already described the artistic forms of Egypt and Assyria, it is
not difficult to discover the origin of almost every idea, and of every
architectural feature, that was afterwards found in Greece.But even
with this assistance we should not be able to understand the phenomena
which Greek art presents to us, were it not that the monuments reveal to
us the existence of two distinct and separate races existing
contemporaneously in Greece.If the Greeks were as purely Aryan as their
language would lead us to believe, all our ethnographic theories are at
fault.But this is precisely one of those cases where archæology steps
in to supplement what philology tells us and to elucidate what that
science fails to reveal.That the language of the Greeks, with the
smallest possible admixture from other sources, is pure Aryan, no one
will dispute: but their arts, their religion, and frequently their
institutions, tend to ascribe to them an altogether different origin.Fortunately the ruins at Mycenæ and Orchomenos are sufficient to afford
us a key to the mystery.From them we learn that at the time of the war
of Troy a people were supreme in Greece who were not Hellenes, but who
were closely allied to the Etruscans and other tomb-building, art-loving
races.Whether they were purely Turanian, or merely ultra-Celtic, may be
questioned; but one thing seems clear, that this people were then known
to the ancients under the name of Pelasgi, and it is their presence in
Greece, mixed up with the more purely Dorian races, which explains what
would otherwise be unintelligible in Grecian civilisation.Except from our knowledge of the existence of a strong infusion of
Turanian blood into the veins of the Grecian people, it would be
impossible to understand how a people so purely Aryan in appearance came
to adopt a religion so essentially Anthropic and Ancestral.Their belief
in oracles, their worship of trees,[124] and many minor peculiarities,
were altogether abhorrent to the Aryan mind.The existence of these two antagonistic elements satisfactorily explains
how it was that while art was unknown in the purely Dorian city of
Sparta, it flourished so exuberantly in the quasi-Pelasgic city of
Athens; why the Dorians borrowed their architectural order from Egypt,
and hardly changed its form during the long period they employed it; and
how it came to pass that the eastern art of the Persians was brought
into Greece, and how it was there modified so essentially that we hardly
recognise the original in its altered and more perfect form.It
explains, too, how the different States of Greece were artistic or
matter-of-fact in the exact proportion in which either of the two
elements predominated in the people.Thus the poetry of Arcadia was unknown in the neighbouring State of
Sparta; but the Doric race there remained true to their institutions and
spread their colonies and their power farther than any other of the
little principalities of Greece.The institutions of Lycurgus could
never have been maintained in Athens; but, on the other hand, the
Parthenon was as impossible in the Lacedemonian State.Even in Athens
art would not have been the wonder that it became without that happy
admixture of the two races which then prevailed, mingling the common
sense of the one with the artistic feeling of the other, which tended to
produce the most brilliant intellectual development which has yet
dazzled the world with its splendour.The contemporary presence of these two races perhaps also explains how
Greek civilisation, though so wonderfully brilliant, passed so quickly
away.Had either race been pure, the Dorian institutions might have
lasted as long as the village-systems of India or the arts of Egypt or
China; but where two dissimilar races mix, the tendency is inevitably to
revert to the type of one, and, though the intermixture may produce a
stock more brilliant than either parent, the type is less permanent and
soon passes away.So soon was it the case, in this instance, that the
whole of the great history of Greece may be said to be comprehended in
the period ranging between the battle of Marathon (B.C.490) and the
peace concluded with Philip of Macedon by the Athenians (B.C.346): so
that the son of a man who was born before the first event may have been
a party to the second.All those wonders of patriotism, of poetry, and
art, for which Greece was famous, crowded into the short space of a
century and a half, is a phenomenon the like of which the world has not
seen before, and is not likely to witness again.As might be expected, from the length of time that has elapsed since the
Pelasgic races ruled in Greece, and owing to the numerous changes that
have taken place in that country since their day, their architectural
remains are few, and comparatively insignificant.It has thus come to
pass that, were it not for their tombs, their city walls, and their
works of civil engineering, such as bridges and tunnels—in which they
were pre-eminent—we should hardly now possess any material remains to
prove their existence or mark the degree of civilisation to which they
had reached.Section and Plan of Tomb of Atreus at Mycenæ.The most remarkable of these remains are the tombs of the kings of
Mycenæ, a city which in Homeric times had a fair title to be considered
the capital of Greece, or at all events to be considered one of the most
important of her cities.The Dorians described these as treasuries, from
the number of precious objects found in them, as in the tombs of the
Etruscans, and because they looked upon such halls as far more than
sufficient for the narrow dwellings of the dead.The most perfect and
the largest of them now existing is known as the Treasury or Tomb of
Atreus at Mycenæ, shown in plan and section in the annexed woodcut.The
principal chamber is 48 ft.in diameter, and is, or was when
perfect, of the shape of a regular equilateral pointed arch, a form well
adapted to the mode of construction, which is that of horizontal layers
of stones, projecting the one beyond the other, till one small stone
closed the whole, and made the vault complete.As will be explained further on, this was the form of dome adopted by
the Jaina architects in India.It prevailed also in Italy and Asia Minor
wherever a Pelasgic race is traced, down to the time when the pointed
form again came into use in the Middle Ages, though it was not then used
as a horizontal, but as a radiating arch.On one side of this hall is a chamber cut in the rock, the true
sepulchre apparently, and externally is a long passage leading to a
doorway, which, judging from the fragments that remain (Woodcut No.125), must have been of a purely Asiatic form of art, and very unlike
anything found subsequent to this period in Greece.Fragment of Pillar in front of Tomb of Atreus at
Mycenæ.]To all appearance the dome was lined internally with plates of brass or
bronze, some nails of which metals are now found there; and the holes in
which the nails were inserted are still to be seen all over the place.A
second tomb or treasury of smaller dimensions was discovered by Dr.Another of these tombs, erected by Minyas at
Orchomenos, described by Pausanias as one of the wonders of Greece,[125]
seems from the remains still existing to have been at least 20 ft.wider
than this one, and proportionably larger in every respect.All these
were covered with earth, and some are probably still hidden which a
diligent search might reveal.Schliemann’s discoveries in
the Acropolis of Mycenæ and in the Troad prove that it is still possible
to discover an unrifled tomb even in Greece.As domes constructed on the horizontal principle, these three are the
largest of which we have any knowledge, though there does not appear to
be any reasonable limit to the extent to which such a form of building
might be carried.When backed by earth,[126] as these were, it is
evident, from the mode of construction, that they cannot be destroyed by
any equable pressure exerted from the exterior.The only danger to be feared is, what is technically called a rising of
the haunches; and to avoid this it might be necessary, where large domes
were attempted, to adopt a form more nearly conical than that used at
Mycenæ.This might be a less pleasing architectural feature, but it is
constructively a better one than the form of the radiating domes we
generally employ.It is certainly to be regretted that more of the decorative features of
this early style have not been discovered.They differ so entirely from
anything else in Greece, and are so purely Asiatic in form, that it
would be exceedingly interesting to be able to restore a complete
decoration of any sort.In all the parts hitherto brought to light, an
Ionic-like scroll is repeated in every part and over every detail,
rather rudely executed, but probably originally heightened by colour.Its counterparts are found in Assyria and at Persepolis, but nowhere
else in Greece.[127]

[Illustration: 126.(From Dodwell’s ‘Greece.’)]

The Pelasgic races soon learnt to adopt for their doorways the more
pleasing curvilinear form with which they were already familiar from
their interiors.126) from a
gateway at Thoricus, in Attica, serves to show its simplest and earliest
form; and the illustration (Woodcut No.129) from Assos, in Asia Minor,
of a far more modern date, shows the most complicated form it took in
ancient times.In this last instance it is merely a discharging arch,
and so little fitted for the purpose to which it is applied, that we can
only suppose that its adoption arose from a strong predilection for this
shape.Another illustration of Pelasgic masonry is found at Delos (Woodcut No.127), consisting of a roof formed by two arch stones, at a certain angle
to one another, similar to the plan adopted in Egypt, and is further
interesting as being associated with capitals of pillars formed of the
front part of bulls, as in Assyria, pointing again to the intimate
connection that existed between Greece and Asia at this early period of
the former’s history.(From Stuart’s ‘Athens.’)]

In all these instances it does not seem to have been so much want of
knowledge that led these early builders to adopt the horizontal in
preference to the radiating principle, as a conviction of its greater
durability, as well, perhaps, as a certain predilection for an ancient
mode.In the construction of their walls they adhered, as a mere matter of
taste, to forms which they must have known to be inferior to others.In
the example, for instance, of a wall in the Peloponnesus (woodcut No.128), we find the polygonal masonry of an earlier age actually placed
upon as perfect a specimen built in regular courses, or what is
technically called _ashlar_ work, as any to be found in Greece; and on
the other side of the gateway at Assos (Woodcut No.129) there exists a
semicircular arch, shown by the dotted lines, which is constructed
horizontally, and could only have been copied from a radiating arch.(From Blouet’s ‘Voyage en
Grèce.’)]

Their city walls are chiefly remarkable for the size of the blocks of
stone used and for the beauty with which their irregular joints and
courses are fitted into one another.Like most fortifications, they are
generally devoid of ornament, the only architectural features being the
openings.These are interesting, as showing the steps by which a
peculiar form of masonry was perfected, and which, in after ages, led to
important architectural results.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

One of the most primitive of these buildings is a nameless ruin existing
near Missolonghi (Woodcut No.In it the sides of the opening are
straight for the whole height, and, though making a very stable form of
opening, it is one to which it is extremely difficult to fit doors, or
to close by any known means.It was this difficulty that led to the next
expedient adopted of inserting a lintel at a certain height, and making
the jambs more perpendicular below, and more sloping above.This method
is already exemplified in the tomb of Atreus (Woodcut No.124), and in
the Gate of the Lions at Mycenæ (Woodcut No.131); but it is by no means
clear whether the pediments were always filled up with sculpture, as in
this instance, or left open.In the walls of a town they were probably
always closed, but left open in a chamber.In the gate at Mycenæ the two
lions stand against an altar[128] shaped like a pillar, of a form found
only in Lycia, in which the round ends of the timbers of the roof are
shown as if projecting into the frieze.These are slight remains, it must be confessed, from which to
reconstruct an art which had so much influence on the civilisation of
Greece; but they are sufficient for the archæologist, as the existence
of a few fossil fragments of the bones of an elephant or a tortoise
suffice to prove the pre-existence of those animals wherever they have
been found, and enable the palæontologist to reason upon them with
almost as much certainty as if he saw them in a menagerie.Nor is it
difficult to see why the remnants are so few.When Homer describes the
imaginary dwelling of Alcinous—which he meant to be typical of a perfect
palace in his day—he does not speak of its construction or solidity, nor
tell us how symmetrically it was arranged; but he is lavish of his
praise of its brazen walls, its golden doors with their silver posts and
lintels—just as the writers of the Books of Kings and Chronicles praise
the contemporary temple or palace of Solomon for similar metallic
splendour.The palace of Menelaus is described by the same author as full of brass
and gold, silver and ivory.It was resplendent as the sun and moon, and
appeared to the eye of Telemachus like the mansion of Jupiter himself.On the architecture of the early Greek palaces considerable light has
been thrown through the researches of the late Dr.Schliemann at Tiryns,
on his second visit in 1884, when he was accompanied by Dr.Dörpfield,
who measured and drew out the plan which is here reproduced (Woodcut No.The palace at Tiryns is assumed by Dr.Schliemann to have been
destroyed by fire in the 11th century B.C.It was built in the upper
citadel and faced the south.The citadel was entered through a propylæum
with outer and inner portico, both in antis.A second propylæum of
smaller dimensions on the south of the entrance court gave access to the
chief court of the palace; this court was surrounded by porticoes on
three sides, and on the fourth or south side, a vestibule consisting of
a portico-in-antis leading to an ante-chamber, and the megaron or men’s
hall.The ante-chamber was separated from the portico by three
folding-doors, hung on solid timber framing; a single door, probably
closed by a curtain only, led from the ante-chamber to the men’s hall,
measuring 48 ft.by 33 ft., the roof of which was supported on four
pillars or columns; a circle in the centre of these indicated probably
the hearth.There are various chambers on the west side, one of which,
the bath-room, measuring 13 ft.by 10 ft., had a floor consisting of a
gigantic block of limestone 2 ft.On
the east side of the men’s hall was a second court with vestibule or
south side leading to the women’s hall (thalamos), 24 ft.by 17 ft., and
various other rooms on the west side of it.To the south of the women’s
court was a third court which may be considered to be the court of
service, with a passage leading direct to the entrance propylon of the
citadel.The walls were built in rubble masonry and clay mortar (clay mixed with
straw or hay); the foundations were carried from 6 ft.The walls were protected externally; first by a layer of
clay of various thicknesses and then with a plaster of lime about half
an inch thick.The upper portions of the walls generally consisted of
sun-dried bricks, and in order to give greater strength to the walls,
beams laid on thin slabs of stone (to give a horizontal bed) were built
into the outer surface.Blocks of hard limestone or breccia were used
for all the steps and door cills.The exposed angles of the walls and
the responds or antæ[129] of the columns were built of stone in the
lower part and wood above (in Troy they were always in wood with a stone
base).Opinions differ as to the lighting of the halls; the smaller
chambers were probably lighted through the door, as in Pompeii; but the
men’s and women’s halls must either have received their light through
openings at the side under the roof, or by a raised lantern over the
hearth before referred to.No temples are mentioned by Homer, nor by any early writer; but the
funereal rites celebrated in honour of Patroclus, as described in the
XXIII.Book of the Iliad, and the mounds still existing on the Plains of
Troy, testify to the character of the people whose manners and customs
he was describing, and would alone be sufficient to convince us that,
except in their tombs, we should find little to commemorate their
previous existence.The subject is interesting, and deserves far more attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon it, and more space than can be devoted to it
here.Not only is this art the art of people who warred before Troy, but
our knowledge of it reveals to us a secret which otherwise might for
ever have remained a mystery.The religion of the Homeric poems is
essentially Anthropic and Ancestral—in other words, of Turanian origin,
with hardly a trace of Aryan feeling running through it.When we know
that the same was the case with the arts of those days, we feel that it
could not well be otherwise; but what most excites our wonder is the
power of the poet, whose song, describing the manners and feelings of an
extinct race, was so beautiful as to cause its adoption as a gospel by a
people of another race, tincturing their religion to the latest hour of
their existence.We have very little means of knowing how long this style of art lasted
in Greece.The treasury built by Myron king of Sicyon at Olympia about
650 B.C.seems to have been of this style, in so far as we can judge of
it by the description of Pausanias.[130] It consisted of two chambers,
one ornamented in the Doric, one in the Ionic style, not apparently with
pillars, but with that kind of decoration which appears at that period
to have been recognised as peculiar to each.But the entire decorations
seem to have been of brass, the weight of metal employed being recorded
in an inscription on the building.The earliest example of a Doric
temple that we know of—that of Corinth—would appear to belong to very
nearly the same age, so that the 7th century B.C.may probably be taken
as the period when the old Turanian form of Pelasgic art gave way before
the sterner and more perfect creations of a purer Hellenic design.Perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Hellenic history of
Greece commenced with the Olympiads (B.C.776), but before that kingdom
bloomed into perfection an older civilisation had passed away, leaving
little beyond a few tombs and works of public utility as records of its
prior existence.It left, however, an undying influence which can be
traced through every subsequent stage of Grecian history, which gave
form to that wonderful artistic development of art, the principal if not
the only cause of the unrivalled degree of perfection to which it
subsequently attained.B. Temple of Niké Apteros.E. Foundations of old Temple of Athena, sixth century B.C.
]The culminating period of the Pelasgic civilisation of Greece was at the
time of the war with Troy—the last great military event of that age, and
the one which seems to have closed the long and intimate connection of
the Greek Pelasgians with their cognate races in Asia.Sixty years later the irruption of the Thessalians, and twenty years
after that event the return of the Heracleidæ, closed, in a political
sense, that chapter in history, and gave rise to what may be styled the
Hellenic civilisation, which proved the great and true glory of Greece.Four centuries, however, elapsed, which may appropriately be called the
dark ages of Greece, before the new seed bore fruit, at least in so far
as art is concerned.These ages produced, it is true, the laws of
Lycurgus, a characteristic effort of a truly Aryan race, conferring as
they did on the people who made them that power of self-government, and
capacity for republican institutions, which gave them such stability at
home and so much power abroad, but which were as inimical to the softer
glories of the fine arts in Sparta as they have proved elsewhere.When, after this long night, architectural art reappeared, it was at
Corinth, under the Cypselidæ, a race of strongly-marked Asiatic
tendencies; but it had in the meantime undergone so great a
transformation as to well-nigh bewilder us.On its reappearance it was
no longer characterised by the elegant and ornate art of Mycenæ and the
cognate forms of Asiatic growth, but had assumed the rude, bold
proportions of Egyptian art, and with almost more than Egyptian
massiveness.DORIC TEMPLES IN GREECE.The age of the Doric temple at Corinth is not, it is true,
satisfactorily determined; but the balance of evidence would lead us to
believe that it belongs to the age of Cypselus, or about 650 B.C.The
pillars are less than four diameters in height, and the architrave—the
only part of the superstructure that now remains—is proportionately
heavy.It is, indeed, one of the most massive specimens of architecture
existing, more so than even the rock-cut prototype at Beni Hasan.As a
work of art, it fails from excess of strength, a fault common to most of
the efforts of a rude people, ignorant of the true resources of art, and
striving, by the expression of physical power alone, to attain its
objects.Next in age to this is the little temple at Ægina.[131] Its date, too,
is unknown, though, judging from the character of its sculpture, it
probably belongs to the middle of the sixth century before Christ.We know that Athens had a great temple on the Acropolis, contemporary
with these, and the frusta of its columns still remain, which, after its
destruction by the Persians, were built into the walls of the citadel.It is more than probable that all the principal cities of Greece had
temples commensurate with their dignity before the Persian War.Many of
these were destroyed during that struggle; but it also happened then, as
in France and England in the 12th and 13th centuries, that the old
temples were thought unworthy of the national greatness, and of that
feeling of exaltation arising from the successful result of the greatest
of their wars, so that almost all those which remained were pulled down
or rebuilt.The consequence is, that nearly all the great temples now
found in Greece were built in the forty or fifty years which succeeded
the defeat of the Persians at Salamis and Platæa.One of the oldest temples of this class is that best known as the
Theseion or Temple of Theseus at Athens, now recognised as the Temple of
Hephaistos mentioned in the “Attica” of Pausanias.By an analysis of the
architectural character of the Temple Dr.Dorpfield contends that it is
posterior to the Parthenon and not anterior, as is generally supposed.Of all the great temples, the best and most celebrated is the Parthenon,
the only octastyle Doric Temple in Greece, and in its own class
undoubtedly the most beautiful building in the world.It is true it has
neither the dimensions nor the wondrous expression of power and eternity
inherent in Egyptian temples, nor has it the variety and poetry of the
Gothic Cathedral; but for intellectual beauty, for perfection of
proportion, for beauty of detail, and for the exquisite perception of
the highest and most recondite principles of art ever applied to
architecture, it stands utterly and entirely alone and unrivalled—the
glory of Greece and a reproach to the rest of the world.Next in size and in beauty to this was the great hexastyle temple of
Jupiter at Olympia, finished two years later than the Parthenon.Its
dimensions were nearly the same, but having only six pillars in front
instead of eight, as in the Parthenon, the proportions were different,
this temple being 95 ft.by 230, the Parthenon 101 ft.The excavations at Olympia, undertaken at the cost of the German
Government in 1876, not only laid bare the site of the Temple of
Jupiter, of which the lower frusta of half the column, the lower
portions of the walls of cella and nearly the whole of the pavement was
found in situ; but led to the recovery of a great portion of the
sculptures which decorated the metopes and filled the pediments, so that
it is not only possible to restore the complete design of the temple
itself but to obtain a distinct idea of its sculptural decoration.The
foundations of other Doric temples were found; of the Temple of Hera,
which seems originally to have been a wooden structure, the wood being
gradually replaced by stone when from its decay it required
renewal.[132] This temple was coeval if not more ancient than that of
Zeus; the interior of the cella would seem to have been subdivided into
bays or niches inside, similar to those of the Temple at Bassæ; a third
hexastyle Doric temple, the Metroum, was also discovered, and many
buildings dating from the Roman occupation.To the same age belongs the exquisite little Temple of Apollo Epicurius
at Bassæ (47 ft.by 125), the Temple of Minerva at Sunium, the greater
temple at Rhamnus, the Propylæa at Athens, and indeed all that is
greatest and most beautiful in the architecture of Greece.The temple of
Ceres at Eleusis also was founded and designed at this period, but its
execution belongs to a later date.The temple at Assos, though not of any great size, is interesting on
account of its having had the outer face of the architrave sculptured in
relief, requiring therefore an architectural frame which was obtained by
leaving a raised fillet along the bottom.The temple was
hexastyle-peristyle with pronaos but no posticum.The date is assumed to
be about 470 B.C., or shortly after the battle of Mycale.[133]


                        DORIC TEMPLES IN SICILY.Owing probably to some local peculiarity, which we have not now the
means of explaining, the Dorian colonies of Sicily and Magna Græcia seem
to have possessed, in the days of their prosperity, a greater number of
temples, and certainly retain the traces of many more, than were or are
to be found in any of the great cities of the mother country.The one
city of Selinus alone possesses six, in two groups,—three in the citadel
and three in the city.Of these the oldest is the central one of the
first-named group.Angell
and Harris, indicate an age only slightly subsequent to the foundation
of the colony, B.C.636, and therefore probably nearly contemporary with
the example above mentioned at Corinth.The most modern is the great
octastyle temple, which seems to have been left unfinished at the time
of the destruction of the city by the Carthaginians, B.C.by 166, and was consequently very much larger than any
temple of its class in Greece.The remaining four range between these
dates, and therefore form a tolerably perfect chronometric series at
that time when the arts of Greece itself fail us.The inferiority,
however, of provincial art, as compared with that of Greece itself,
prevents us from applying such a test with too much confidence to the
real history of the art, though it is undoubtedly valuable as a
secondary illustration.At Agrigentum there are three Doric temples, two small hexastyles, whose
age may be about 500 to 480 B.C., and one great exceptional example,
differing in its arrangements from all the Grecian temples of the age.long by 173 broad, and consequently very
nearly the same as those of the great Temple of Selinus just alluded to.Its date is perfectly known, as it was commenced by Theron, B.C.480,
and left unfinished seventy-five years afterwards, when the city was
destroyed by the Carthaginians.At Syracuse there still exist the ruins of a very beautiful temple of
this age; and at Segesta are remains of another in a much more perfect
state.Pæstum, in Magna Græcia, boasts of the most magnificent group of temples
after that at Agrigentum.One is a very beautiful hexastyle, belonging
probably to the middle of the fifth century B.C., built in a bold and
very pure style of Doric architecture, and still retains the greater
part of its internal columnar arrangement.The other two are more modern, and are far less pure both in plan and in
detail, one having nine columns at each end, the central pillars of
which are meant to correspond with an internal range of pillars,
supporting the ridge of the roof.The other, though of a regular form,
is so modified by local peculiarities, so corrupt, in fact, as hardly to
deserve being ranked with the beautiful order which it most resembles.We have even fewer materials for the history of the Ionic order in
Greece than we have for that of the Doric.The recent discoveries in
Assyria have proved beyond a doubt that the Ionic was even more
essentially an introduction from Asia[134] than the Doric was from
Egypt: the only question is, when it was brought into Greece.My own
impression is, that it existed there in one form or another from the
earliest ages, but owing to its slenderer proportions, and the greater
quantity of wood used in its construction, the examples may have
perished, so that nothing is now known to exist which can lay claim to
even so great an antiquity as the Persian War.The oldest example, probably, was the temple on the Ilissus, now
destroyed, dating from about 484 B.C.; next to this is the little gem of
a temple dedicated to Niké Apteros, or the Wingless Victory, built about
fifteen years later, in front of the Propylæa at Athens.The last and
most perfect of all the examples of this order is the Erechtheium, on
the Acropolis; its date is apparently about 420 B.C., the great epoch of
Athenian art.Nowhere did the exquisite taste and skill of the Athenians
show themselves to greater advantage than here; for though every detail
of the order may be traced back to Nineveh or Persepolis, all are so
purified, so imbued with purely Grecian taste and feeling, that they
have become essential parts of a far more beautiful order than ever
existed in the land in which they had their origin.The largest, and perhaps the finest, of Grecian Ionic temples was that
built about a century afterwards at Tegea, in Arcadia—a regular
peripteral temple of considerable dimensions, but the existence of which
is now known only from the description of Pausanias.[135]

As in the case, however, of the Doric order, it is not in Greece itself
that we find either the greatest number of Ionic temples or those most
remarkable for size, but in the colonies in Asia Minor, and more
especially in Ionia, whence the order most properly takes its name.That an Ionic order existed in Asia Minor before the Persian War is
quite certain, but all examples perished in that memorable struggle; and
when it subsequently reappeared, the order had lost much of its purely
Asiatic character, and assumed certain forms and tendencies borrowed
from the simpler and purer Doric style.If any temple in the Asiatic Greek colonies escaped destruction in the
Persian wars, it was that of Juno at Samos.It is said to have been
built by Polycrates, and appears to have been of the Doric order.The
ruins now found there are of the Ionic order, 346 ft.by 190 ft., and
must have succeeded the first mentioned.The apparent archaisms in the
form of the bases, &c., which have misled antiquarians, are merely
Eastern forms retained in spite of Grecian influence.More remarkable even than this was the celebrated Temple of Diana at
Ephesus, said by Pliny to have been 425 ft.Recent
excavations on the site, however, carried out by Mr.T. Wood, prove that
these dimensions apply only to the platform on which it stood.The
temple itself, measured from the outside of the angle pillars, was only
348 ft.by 164, making the area 57,072 ft., or about the average
dimensions of our mediæval cathedrals.Besides these, there was a splendid decastyle temple, dedicated to
Apollo Didymæus, at Miletus, 156 ft.in length; an
octastyle at Sardis, 261 ft.; an exquisitely beautiful,
though small hexastyle, at Priene, 122 ft.; and another at
Teos, and smaller examples elsewhere, besides many others which have no
doubt perished.German explorations in Pergamon have brought to light the remains of the
Augustæum, a building consisting of two detached wings with columns of
the Ionic order resting on a lofty podium enriched with sculpture and
connected one with the other by a magnificent flight of steps, the whole
block measuring 125 ft.[136]


                          CORINTHIAN TEMPLES.The Corinthian order is as essentially borrowed from the bell-shaped
capitals of Egypt as the Doric is from their oldest pillars.Like
everything they touched, the Greeks soon rendered it their own by the
freedom and elegance with which they treated it.The acanthus-leaf with
which they adorned it is essentially Grecian, and we must suppose that
it had been used by them as an ornament, either in their metal or wood
work, long before they adopted it in stone as an architectural feature.As in everything else, however, the Greeks could not help betraying in
this also the Asiatic origin of their art, and the Egyptian order with
them was soon wedded to the Ionic, whose volutes became an essential
though subdued part of this order.It is in fact a composite order, made
up of the bell-shaped capitals of the Egyptians and the spiral of the
Assyrians, and adopted by the Greeks at a time when national
distinctions were rapidly disappearing, and when true and severer art
was giving place to love of variety.At that time also mere ornament and
carving were supplanting the purer class of forms and the higher
aspirations of sculpture with which the Greeks ornamented their temples
in their best days.In Greece the order does not appear to have been introduced, or at least
generally used, before the age of Alexander the Great; the oldest
authentic example, and also one of the most beautiful, being the
Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (B.C.335), which, notwithstanding the
smallness of its dimensions, is one of the most beautiful works of art
of the merely ornamental class to be found in any part of the world.A
simpler example, but by no means so beautiful, is that of the porticoes
of the small octagonal building commonly called the Tower of the Winds
at Athens.The largest example in Greece of the Corinthian order is the
Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.This, however, may almost be
called a Roman building, though on Grecian soil—having been commenced in
its present form under Antiochus Epiphanes, in the second century B.C.by the Roman architect Cossutius, and only finished by Hadrian, to whom
probably we may ascribe the greatest part of what now remains.by 354 ft., and from the number of its columns,
their size and their beauty, it must have been when complete the most
beautiful Corinthian temple of the ancient world.Judging, however, from some fragments found among the Ionic temples of
Asia Minor, it appears that the Corinthian order was introduced there
before we find any trace of it in Greece Proper.Indeed, _à priori_, we
might expect that its introduction into Greece was part of that reaction
which the elegant and luxurious Asiatics exercised on the severer and
more manly inhabitants of European Greece, and which was in fact the
main cause of their subjection, first to the Macedonians, and finally
beneath the iron yoke of Rome.As used by the Asiatics, it seems to have
arisen from the introduction of the bell-shaped capital of the
Egyptians, to which they applied the acanthus-leaf, sometimes in
conjunction with the honeysuckle ornament of the time, as in Woodcut No.135, and on other and later occasions together with the volutes of the
same order, the latter combination being the one which ultimately
prevailed and became the typical form of the Corinthian capital.DIMENSIONS OF GREEK TEMPLES.Although differing so essentially in plan, the general dimensions of the
larger temples of the Greeks were very similar to those of the mediæval
cathedrals, and although they never reached the altitude of their modern
rivals, their cubic dimensions were probably in about the same ratio of
proportion.The following table gives the approximate dimensions, rejecting
fractions, of the eight largest and best known examples:—

   Juno, at Samos         346 feet long 190 feet wide = 65,740 feet.Jupiter, at Agrigentum 360 feet long 173 feet wide = 62,280 feet.Apollo, at Branchidæ   362 feet long 168 feet wide = 60,816 feet.Diana, at Ephesus      348 feet long 164 feet wide = 57,072 feet.Jupiter, at Athens     354 feet long 135 feet wide = 47,790 feet.Didymæus, at Miletus   295 feet long 156 feet wide = 45,020 feet.Cybele, at Sardis      261 feet long 144 feet wide = 37,884 feet.Parthenon, at Athens   228 feet long 101 feet wide = 23,028 feet.There may be some slight discrepancies in this table from the figures
quoted elsewhere, and incorrectness arising from some of the temples
being measured on the lowest step and others, as the Parthenon, on the
highest; but it is sufficient for comparison, which is all that is
attempted in its compilation.The Doric was the order which the Greeks especially loved and cultivated
so as to make it most exclusively their own; and, as used in the
Parthenon, it certainly is as complete and as perfect an architectural
feature as any style can boast of.When first introduced from Egypt, it,
as before stated, partook of even more than Egyptian solidity, but by
degrees became attenuated to the weak and lean form of the Roman order
of the same name.136, 137, 138 illustrate the three stages
of progress from the oldest example at Corinth to the order as used in
the time of Philip at Delos, the intermediate being the culminating
point in the age of Pericles: the first is 4·47 diameters in height, the
next 6·025, the last 7·015; and if the table were filled up with all the
other examples, the gradual attenuation of the shaft would very nearly
give the relative date of the example.This fact is in itself sufficient
to refute the idea of the pillar being copied from a wooden post, as in
that case it would have been slenderer at first, and would gradually
have departed from the wooden form as the style advanced.[137] This is
the case in all carpentry styles.With the Doric order the contrary
takes place.The earlier the example the more unlike it is to any wooden
original.As the masons advanced in skill and power over their stone
material, it came more and more to resemble posts or pillars of wood.The fact appears to be that, either in Egypt or in early Greece, the
pillar was originally a pier of brickwork, or of rubble masonry,
supporting a wooden roof, of which the architraves, the triglyphs, and
the various parts of the cornice, all bore traces down to the latest
period.Even as ordinarily represented, or as copied in this country, there is a
degree of solidity combined with elegance in this order, and an
exquisite proportion of the parts to one another and to the work they
have to perform, that command the admiration of every person of taste;
but, as used in Greece, its beauty was very much enhanced by a number of
refinements whose existence was not suspected till lately, and even now
cannot be detected but by the most practised eye.The columns were at first assumed to be bounded by straight lines.It is
now found that they have an _entasis_, or convex profile, in the
Parthenon to the extent of 1/550 of the whole height, and are outlined
by a very delicate hyperbolic curve; it is true this can hardly be
detected by the eye in ordinary positions, but the want of it gives that
rigidity and poverty to the column which is observable in modern
examples.[138]

In like manner, the architrave in all temples was carried upwards so as
to form a very flat arch, just sufficient to correct the optical
delusion arising from the interference of the sloping lines of the
pediment.This, I believe, was common to all temples, but in the
Parthenon the curve was applied to the sides also, though from what
motive it is not so easy to detect.Another refinement was making all the columns <DW72> slightly inwards, so
as to give an idea of strength and support to the whole.Add to this,
that all the curved lines used were either hyperbolas or parabolas.With
one exception only, no circular line was employed, nor even an ellipse.Every part of the temple was also arranged with the most unbounded care
and accuracy, and every detail of the masonry was carried out with a
precision and beauty of execution which is almost unrivalled, and it may
be added that the material of the whole was the purest and best white
marble.All these delicate adjustments, this exquisite finish and
attention to even the smallest details, are well bestowed on a design in
itself simple, beautiful, and appropriate.They combine to render this
order, as found in the best Greek temples, as nearly faultless as any
work of art can possibly be, and such as we may dwell upon with the most
unmixed and unvarying satisfaction.The system of definite proportion which the Greeks employed in the
design of their temples, was another cause of the effect they produce
even on uneducated minds.It was not with them merely that the height
was equal to the width, or the length about twice the breadth; but every
part was proportioned to all those parts with which it was related, in
some such ratio as 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, 4 to 9, or 5 to 10, &c. As
the scheme advances these numbers become undesirably high.In this case
they reverted to some such simple ratios as 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and
so on.We do not yet quite understand the process of reasoning by which the
Greeks arrived at the laws which guided their practice in this respect;
but they evidently attached the utmost importance to it, and when the
ratio was determined upon, they set it out with such accuracy, that even
now the calculated and the measured dimensions seldom vary beyond such
minute fractions as can only be expressed in hundredths of an inch.Though the existence of such a system of ratios has long been suspected,
it is only recently that any measurements of Greek temples have been
made with sufficient accuracy to enable the matter to be properly
investigated and their existence proved.[139]

The ratios are in some instances so recondite, and the correlation of
the parts at first sight so apparently remote, that many would be
inclined to believe they were more fanciful than real.[140] It would,
however, be as reasonable in a person with no ear, or no musical
education, to object to the enjoyment of a complicated concerted piece
of music experienced by those differently situated, or to declare that
the pain musicians feel from a false note was mere affectation.The eyes
of the Greeks were as perfectly educated as our ears.They could
appreciate harmonies which are lost in us, and were offended at false
quantities which our duller senses fail to perceive.But in spite of
ourselves, we do feel the beauty of these harmonic relations, though we
hardly know why; and if educated to them, we might acquire what might
almost be considered a new sense.But be this as it may, there can be no
doubt but that a great deal of the beauty which all feel in
contemplating the architectural productions of the Greeks, arises from
causes such as these, which we are only now beginning to appreciate.To understand, however, the Doric order, we must not regard it as a
merely masonic form.Sculpture was always used, or intended to be used,
with it.The Metopes between the triglyphs, the pediments of the
porticoes, and the acroteria or pedestals on the roof, are all unmeaning
and useless unless filled or surmounted with sculptured figures.Sculpture is, indeed, as essential a part of this order as the
acanthus-leaves and ornaments of the cornice are to the capitals and
entablature of the Corinthian order; and without it, or without its
place being supplied by painting, we are merely looking at the dead
skeleton, the mere framework of the order, without the flesh and blood
that gave it life and purpose.It is when all these parts are combined together, as in the portico of
the Parthenon (Woodcut No.139), that we can understand this order in
all its perfection; for though each part was beautiful in itself, their
full value can be appreciated only as parts of a great whole.Another essential part of the order, too often overlooked, is the
colour, which was as integral a part of it as its form.Till very
lately, it was denied that Greek temples were, or could be, painted: the
unmistakable remains of colour, however, that have been discovered in
almost all temples, and the greater knowledge of the value and use of it
which now prevails, have altered public opinion very much on the matter,
and most people now admit that some colour was used, though few are
agreed as to the extent to which it was carried.It cannot now be questioned that colour was used everywhere internally,
and on every object.Externally too it is generally admitted that the
sculpture was painted and relieved by strongly <DW52> backgrounds; the
lacunaria, or recesses of the roof, were also certainly painted; and all
the architectural mouldings, which at a later period were carved in
relief, have been found to retain traces of their painted ornaments.It is disputed whether the echinus or carved moulding of the capital was
so ornamented.There seems little doubt but that it was; and that the
walls of the cells were also  throughout and covered with
paintings illustrative of the legends and attributes of the divinity to
whom the temple was dedicated or of the purposes for which it was
erected.The plane face of the architrave was probably left white, or
merely ornamented with metal shields or inscriptions, and the shafts of
the columns appear also to have been left plain, or merely slightly
stained to tone down the crudeness of the white marble.Generally
speaking, all those parts which from their form or position were in any
degree protected from the rain or atmospheric influences seem to have
been ; those particularly exposed, to have been left plain.To
whatever extent, however, painting may have been carried, these 
ornaments were as essential a part of the Doric order as the carved
ornaments were of the Corinthian, and made it, when perfect, a richer
and more ornamental, as it was a more solid and stable, order than the
latter.The colour nowhere interfered with the beauty of its forms, but
gave it that richness and amount of ornamentation which is indispensable
in all except the most colossal buildings, and a most valuable adjunct
even to them.The Ionic order, as we now find it, is not without some decided
advantages over the Doric.It is more complete in itself and less
dependent on sculpture.Its frieze was too small for much display of
human life and action, and was probably usually ornamented with lines of
animals,[141] like the friezes at Persepolis.But the frieze of the
little temple of Nikè Apteros is brilliantly ornamented in the same
style as those of the Doric order.It also happened that those details
and ornaments which were only painted in the Doric, were carved in the
Ionic order, and remain therefore visible to the present day, which
gives to this order a completeness in our eyes which the other cannot
boast of.Add to this a certain degree of Asiatic elegance and grace,
and the whole when put together makes up a singularly pleasing
architectural object.But notwithstanding these advantages, the Doric
order will probably always be admitted to be superior, as belonging to a
higher class of art, and because all its forms and details are better
and more adapted to their purpose than those of the Ionic.Ionic order of Erechtheium at Athens.]The principal characteristic of the Ionic order is the Pelasgic or
Asiatic spiral, here called a volute, which, notwithstanding its
elegance, forms at best but an awkward capital.The Assyrian honeysuckle
below this, carved as it is with the exquisite feeling and taste which a
Greek alone knew how to impart to such an object, forms as elegant an
architectural detail as is anywhere to be found; and whether used as the
necking of a column, or on the crowning member of a cornice, or on other
parts of the order, is everywhere the most beautiful ornament connected
with it.Comparing this order with that at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96),
the only truly Asiatic prototype we have of it, we see how much the
Doric feeling of the Greeks had done to sober it down, by abbreviating
the capital and omitting the greater part of the base.This process was
carried much farther when the order was used in conjunction with the
Doric, as in the Propylæa, than when used by itself, as in the
Erechtheium; still in every case all the parts found in the Asiatic
style are found in the Greek.The same form and feelings pervade both;
and, except in beauty of execution and detail, it is not quite clear how
far even the Greek order is an improvement on the Eastern one.The
Persepolitan base is certainly the more beautiful of the two; so are
many parts of the capital.The perfection of the whole, however, depends
on the mode in which it is employed; and it is perfectly evident that
the Persian order could not be combined with the Doric, nor applied with
much propriety as an external order, which was the essential use of all
the Grecian forms of pillars.Ionic order in Temple of Apollo at Bassæ.]Section of half of the Ionic Capital at Bassæ, taken
through the volute.]When used between antæ or square piers, as seems usually to have been
the case in Assyria, the two-fronted form of the Ionic capital was
appropriate and elegant; but when it was employed, as in the
Erechtheium, as an angle column, it presented a difficulty which even
Grecian skill and ingenuity could not quite conquer.When the Persians
wanted the capital to face four ways they turned the side outwards, as
at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96), and put the volutes in the angles—which
was at best but an awkward mode of getting over the difficulty.The instance in which these difficulties have been most successfully met
is in the internal order at Bassæ.There the three sides are equal, and
are equally seen—the fourth is attached to the wall—and the junction of
the faces is formed with an elegance that has never been surpassed.It
has not the richness of the order of the Erechtheium, but it excels it
in elegance.Its widely spreading base still retains traces of the
wooden origin of the order, and carries us back towards the times when a
shoe was necessary to support wooden posts on the floor of an Assyrian
hall.Notwithstanding the amount of carving which the Ionic order displays,
there can be little doubt of its having been also ornamented with colour
to a considerable extent, but probably in a different manner from the
Doric.My own impression is, that the carved parts were gilt, or picked
out with gold, relieved by  grounds, varied according to the
situation in which they were found.The existing remains prove that
colours were used in juxtaposition, to relieve and heighten the
architectural effect of the carved ornaments of this order.In the Ionic temples at Athens the same exquisite masonry was used as in
the Doric; the same mathematical precision and care is bestowed on the
entasis of the columns, the drawing of the volutes, and the execution of
even the minutest details; and much of its beauty and effect are no
doubt owing to this circumstance, which we miss so painfully in nearly
all modern examples.As before mentioned, the Corinthian order was only introduced into
Greece on the decline of art, and never rose during the purely Grecian
age to the dignity of a temple order.It most probably, however, was
used in the more ornate specimens of domestic architecture, and in
smaller works of art, long before any of those examples of it were
executed which we now find in Greece.Order of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.]The most typical specimen we now know is that of the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates (Woodcut No.143), which, notwithstanding all its elegance
of detail and execution, can hardly be pronounced to be perfect, the
Egyptian and Asiatic features being only very indifferently united to
one another.The foliaged part is rich and full, but is not carried up
into the upper or Ionic portion, which is, in comparison, lean and poor;
and though separately the two parts are irreproachable, it was left to
the Romans so to blend the two together as to make a perfectly
satisfactory whole out of them.In this example, as now existing, the junction of the column with the
capital is left a plain sinking, and so it is generally copied in modern
times; but there can be little doubt that this was originally filled by
a bronze wreath, which was probably gilt.Accordingly this is so
represented in the woodcut as being essential to the completion of the
order.The base and shaft have, like the upper part of the capital, more
Ionic feeling in them than the order was afterwards allowed to retain;
and altogether it is, as here practised, far more elegant, though less
complete, than the Roman form which superseded it.Order of the Tower of the Winds, Athens.]The other Athenian example, that of the Tower of the winds (Woodcut No.144), is remarkable as being almost purely Egyptian in its types, with
no Ionic admixture.The columns have no bases, the capitals no volutes,
and the water-leaf clings as closely to the bell as it does in the
Egyptian examples.The result altogether wants richness, and, though
appropriate on so small a scale, would hardly be pleasing on a larger.The great example of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius differs in no
essential part from the Roman order, except that the corners of the
abacus are not cut off; and that, being executed in Athens, there is a
degree of taste and art displayed in its execution which we do not find
in any Roman examples.Strictly speaking, however, it belongs to that
school, and should be enumerated as a Roman, and not as a Grecian,
example.Caryatide Figure in the British Museum.]It has been already explained that the Egyptians never used caryatide
figures, properly so called, to support the entablatures of their
architecture, their figures being always attached to the front of the
columns or piers, which were the real bearing mass.At Persepolis, and
elsewhere in the East, we find figures everywhere employed supporting
the throne or the platform of the palaces of the kings; not, indeed, on
their heads, as the Greeks used them, but rather in their uplifted
hands.The name, however, as well as their being only used in conjunction with
the Ionic order and with Ionic details, all point to an Asiatic origin
for this very questionable form of art.As employed in the little
Portico attached to the Erechtheium, these figures are used with so much
taste, and all the ornaments are so elegant, that it is difficult to
criticise or find fault; but it is nevertheless certain that it was a
mistake which even the art of the Greeks could hardly conceal.To use
human figures to support a cornice is unpardonable, unless it is done as
a mere secondary adjunct to a building.In the Erechtheium it is a
little too prominent for this, though used with as much discretion as
was perhaps possible under the circumstances.Another example of the
sort is shown in Woodcut No.146, which, by employing a taller cap,
avoids some of the objections to the other; but the figure itself, on
the other hand, is less architectural, and so errs on the other side.Caryatide Figure from the Erechtheium.]Another form of this class of support is that of the Giants or
_Telamones_, instances of which are found supporting the roof of the
great Temple at Agrigentum, and in the baths of the semi-Greek city of
Pompeii.As they do not actually bear the entablature, but only seem to
relieve the masonry behind them, their employment is less objectionable
than that of the female figures above described; but even they hardly
fulfil the conditions of true art, and their place might be better
filled by some more strictly architectural feature.The arrangements of Grecian Doric temples show almost less variety than
the forms of the pillars, and no materials exist for tracing their
gradual development in an historical point of view.The temples at
Corinth, and the oldest at Selinus, are both perfect examples of the
hexastyle arrangement to which the Greeks adhered in all ages; and
though there can be little doubt that the peripteral form, as well as
the order itself, was borrowed from Egypt, it still was so much modified
before it appeared in Greece, that it would be interesting, if it could
be done, to trace the several steps by which the change was effected.In an architectural point of view this is by no means difficult.The
simplest Greek temples were mere cells, or small square apartments
suited to contain an image—the front being what is technically called
_distyle in antis_, or with two pillars between _antæ_, or square
pilaster like piers terminating the side walls.Hence the interior
enclosure of Grecian temples is called the cell or cella, however large
and splendid it may be.The next change was to separate the interior into a cell and porch by a
wall with a large doorway in it, as in the small temple at Rhamnus
(Woodcut No.148), where the opening however can scarcely be called a
doorway, as it extends to the roof.A third change was to put a porch of
4 pillars in front of the last arrangement, or, as appears to have been
more usual, to bring forward the screen to the positions of the pillars
as in the last example, and to place the 4 pillars in front of this.None of these plans admitted of a peristyle, or pillars on the flanks.To obtain this it was necessary to increase the number of pillars of the
portico to 6, or, as it is termed, to make it hexastyle, the 2 outer
pillars being the first of a range of 13 or 15 columns, extended along
each side of the temple.The cell in this arrangement was a complete
temple in itself—distyle in antis, most frequently made so at both ends,
and the whole enclosed in its envelope of columns, as in Woodcut No.Sometimes the cell was tetrastyle or with four pillars in front.(From Hittorff,
‘Arch.Antique en Sicile.’) Scale 100 ft.In this form the Greek temple may be said to be complete, very few
exceptions occurring to the rule, though the Parthenon itself is one of
these few.It has an inner hexastyle portico at each end of the cell;
beyond these outwardly are octastyle porticoes, with 17 columns on each
flank.The great Temple at Selinus is also octastyle, but it is neither so
simple nor so beautiful in its arrangement; and, from the decline of
style in the art when it was built, is altogether an inferior example;
still, as one of the largest of Greek Doric temples, its plan is worthy
of being quoted as an illustration of the varying forms of these
temples.Another great exception is the great temple at Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.152 and 154), where the architect attempted an order on so gigantic a
scale that he was unable to construct the pillars with their architraves
standing free.The interstices of the columns are therefore built up
with walls pierced with windows, and altogether the architecture is so
bad, that even its colossal dimensions must have failed to render it at
any time a pleasing or satisfactory work of art.A fourth exception is the double temple at Pæstum, with 9 pillars in
front, a clumsy expedient, but which arose from its having a range of
columns down the centre to support the ridge of the roof by a simpler
mode than the triangular truss usually employed for carrying the roof
between two ranges of column.Plan of Great Temple at Agrigentum.With the exception of the temple at Agrigentum, all these were
peristylar, or had ranges of columns all around them, enclosing the cell
as it were in a case, an arrangement so apparently devoid of purpose,
that it is not at first sight easy to account for its universality.It
will not suffice to say that it was adopted merely because it was
beautiful, for the forms of Egyptian temples, which had no pillars
externally, were as perfect, and in the hands of the Greeks would have
become as beautiful, as the one they adopted.Besides, it is natural to
suppose they would rather have copied the larger than the smaller
temples, if no motive existed for their preference of the latter.The
peristyle, too, was ill suited for an ambulatory, or place for
processions to circulate round the temple; it was too narrow for this,
and too high to protect the procession from the rain.Indeed, I know of
no suggestion except that it may have been adopted to protect the
paintings on the walls of the cells from the inclemency of the weather.It hardly admits of a doubt that the walls were painted, and that
without protection of some sort this would very soon have been
obliterated.It seems also very evident that the peristyle was not only
practically, but artistically, most admirably adapted for this purpose.The paintings of the Greeks were, like those of the Egyptians, composed
of numerous detached groups, connected only by the story, and it almost
required the intervention of pillars, or some means of dividing into
compartments the surface to be so painted, to separate these groups from
one another, and to prevent the whole sequence from being seen at once;
while, on the other hand, nothing can have been more beautiful than the
white marble columns relieved against a richly  plane surface.The one appears so necessary to the other, that it seems hardly to be
doubted that this was the cause, or that the effect must have been most
surpassingly beautiful.MODE OF LIGHTING TEMPLES.The arrangement of the interior of Grecian temples necessarily depended
on the mode in which they were lighted.No one will, I believe, now
contend, as was once done, that it was by lamplight alone that the
beauty of their interiors could be seen; and as light certainly was not
introduced through the side walls, nor could be in sufficient quantities
through the doorways, it is only from the roof that it could be
admitted.At the same time it could not have been by a large horizontal
opening in the roof, as has been supposed, as that would have admitted
the rain and snow as well as the light; and the only alternative seems
to be one I suggested some years ago—of a clerestory,[142] similar
internally to that found in all the great Egyptian temples,[143] but
externally requiring such a change of arrangement as was necessary to
adapt it to a sloping instead of a flat roof.This could have been
effected by countersinking it into the roof, so as to make it in fact 3
ridges in those parts where the light was admitted, though the regular
<DW72> of the roof was retained between these openings, so that neither
the ridge nor the continuity of the lines of the roof was interfered
with.This would effect all that was required, and in the most beautiful
manner; it moreover agrees with all the remains of Greek temples that
now exist, as well as with all the descriptions that have been handed
down to us from antiquity.to 1 in]

[Illustration: 154.Part Section, part Elevation, of Great Temple at
Agrigentum.This arrangement will be understood from the section of the Parthenon
(Woodcut No.153), restored in accordance with the above explanation,
which agrees perfectly with all that remains on the spot, as well as
with all the accounts we have of that celebrated temple.The same system
applies even more easily to the great hexastyle at Pæstum and to the
beautiful little Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, in Phigaleia (Woodcut No.149), and in fact to all regular Greek temples.Indeed, it seems
impossible to account for the peculiarities of that temple except on
some such theory as this.Any one who studies the plan (Woodcut No.149)
will see at once what pains were taken to bring the internal columns
exactly into the spaces between those of the external peristyle.The
effect inside is clumsy, and never would have been attempted were it not
that practically their position was seen from the outside, and this
could hardly have been so on any other hypothesis than that now
proposed.An equally important point in the examination of this theory
is that it applies equally to the exceptional ones.The side aisles, for
instance, of the great temple at Agrigentum were, as before mentioned,
lighted by side windows; the central one could only be lighted from the
roof, and it is easy to see how this could be effected by introducing
openings between the telamones, as shown in Woodcut No.In the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius (Woodcut No.196), as described
by Vitruvius,[144] the nave had two storeys of columns all round, and
the middle was open to the sky.Dorpfield that the temple in Vitruvius’s time was incomplete, and that
subsequently when Hadrian erected the great chryselephantine statue in
it the nave may have lost its hypæthral source of light.(In that case
its light may have been introduced through the court or hypæthron in
front of the cell, such as is shown on the plan in Woodcut No.The Ionic temples of Asia are all too much ruined to enable us to say
exactly in what manner, and to what extent, this mode of lighting was
applied to them, though there seems no doubt that the method there
adopted was very similar in all its main features.Elevation of West End of Erechtheium.The little Temple of Nikè Apteros and the temple on the Ilissus, were
both too small to require any complicated arrangement of the sort, but
the Ionic temple of Pandrosus was lighted by windows which still remain
at the west end, so that it is possible the same expedient may have been
adopted to at least some extent in the Asiatic examples.The latter,
however, is, with one exception, the sole instance of windows in any
European-Greek temple, the only other example being in the very
exceptional temple at Agrigentum.It is valuable, besides, as showing
how little the Greeks were bound by rules or by any fancied laws of
symmetry.As is shown in the plan, elevation, and view (Woodcuts Nos.155, 156,
157), the Erechtheium consisted, properly speaking, of 3 temples grouped
together; and it is astonishing what pains the architect took to prevent
their being mistaken for one.The porticoes of two of them are on
different levels, and the third or caryatide porch is of a different
height and different style.Every one of these features is perfectly
symmetrical in itself, and the group is beautifully balanced and
arranged; and yet no Gothic architect in his wildest moments could have
conceived anything more picturesquely irregular than the whole becomes.Indeed, there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that Greek
architecture was fettered by any fixed laws of formal symmetry: each
detail, every feature, every object, such as a hall or temple, which
could be considered as one complete and separate whole, was perfectly
symmetrical and regular; but no two buildings—no two apartments—if for
different purposes, were made to look like one.On the contrary, it is
quite curious to observe what pains they took to arrange their buildings
so as to produce variety and contrast, instead of formality or
singleness of effect.Temples, when near one another, were never placed
parallel, nor were even their propylæa and adjuncts ever so arranged as
to be seen together or in one line.The Egyptians, as before remarked,
had the same feeling, but carried it into even the details of the same
building, which the Greeks did not.In this, indeed, as in almost every
other artistic mode of expression, they seem to have hit exactly the
happy medium, so as to produce the greatest harmony with the greatest
variety, and to satisfy the minutest scrutiny and the most refined
taste, while their buildings produced an immediate and striking effect
on even the most careless and casual beholders.Owing to the Erechtheium having been converted into a Byzantine church
during the Middle Ages, almost all traces of its original internal
arrangements have been obliterated, and this, with the peculiar
combination of three temples in one, makes it more than usually
difficult to restore.The annexed plan, however, meets all the
requirements of the case in so far as they are known.To the east was a
portico of 6 columns, between two of which stood an altar to Dione,
mentioned in the inscription enumerating the repairs in 409 B.C.;[145]
inside, according to Pausanias,[146] were three altars, the principal
dedicated to Poseidon, the others to Butes and Hephaistos.From its
form, it is evident the roof must have been supported by pillars, and
they probably also bore a clerestory, by which, I believe, with rare
exceptions, all Greek temples were lighted.Restored Plan of Erechtheium.The dark parts remain; the shaded are restorations.
]The Temple of Pandrosus was on a lower level, and was approached by a
flight of steps, corresponding with which was a chamber, containing the
well of salt water, and which apparently was the abode of the
serpent-god Erechthonios, mentioned by Herodotus.[147] The central cell
was lighted by the very exceptional expedient of 3 windows in the
western wall, which looked directly into it.Beyond this, on the south,
was the beautiful caryatide porch, where, if anywhere within the temple,
grew the olive sacred to Minerva.Unfortunately, our principal guide,
Pausanias, does not give us a hint where the olive-tree grew, and on the
whole I am inclined to believe it was in the enclosure outside the
western wall of the temple,[148] and to which a doorway leads directly
from the Temple of Pandrosus, as well as one under the north portico,
the use of which it is impossible to explain unless we assume that this
enclosure was really of exceptional importance.TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.A history of Grecian architecture can hardly be considered as complete
without some mention of the great Ephesian temple, which was one of the
largest and most gorgeous of all those erected by the Greeks, and
considered by them as one of the seven wonders of the world.Strange to
say, till very recently even its situation was utterly unknown; and even
now that it has been revealed to us by the energy and intelligence of
Mr.Wood, scarcely enough remains to enable him to restore the plan with
anything like certainty.This is the more remarkable, as it was found
buried under 17 to 20 feet of mud, which must have been the accumulation
of centuries, and might, one would have thought, have preserved
considerable portions of it from the hand of the spoiler.Plan of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, embodying
Mr.Wood’s researches embodies all the
information he has been able to obtain.The dimensions of the double
peristyle, and the number and position of its 96 columns, are quite
certain.So are the positions of the north, south, and west walls of the
cella; so that the only points of uncertainty are the positions of the
four columns necessary to make up the 100 mentioned by Pliny,[149] and
the internal arrangement of the cella itself and of the opisthodomus.With regard to the first there seems very little latitude for choice.The position of the other two must
be determined either by bringing forward the wall enclosing the stairs,
so as to admit of the intercolumniation east and west being the same as
that of the other columns, or of spacing them so as to divide the inner
roof of the pronaos into equal squares.I have preferred the latter as
that which appears to me the most probable.[150]

The west wall of the cella and the position of the statue having been
found, the arrangement of the pillars surrounding this apartment does
not admit of much latitude.Fragments of these pillars were found, but
not _in situ_, showing that they were in two heights and supported a
gallery.I have spaced them intermediately between the external pillars,
as in the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ (Woodcut No.149), because I do not
know of any other mode by which this temple could be lighted, except by
an opaion, as suggested for that temple; and if this is so they must
have been so spaced.Carrying out this system it leaves an opisthodomus
which is an exact square, which is so likely a form for that apartment
that it affords considerable confirmation to the correctness of this
restoration that it should be so.The four pillars it probably contained
are so spaced as to divide it into nine equal squares.Restored in this manner the temple appears considerably less in
dimensions than might have been supposed from Pliny’s text.His
measurements apply only to the lower step of the platform, which is
found to be 421 ft.But the temple itself, from angle to angle
of the peristyles, is only 342 ft.Assuming this restoration to be correct there can be very little doubt
as to the position of the thirty-six columnæ cælatæ, of which several
specimens have been recovered by Mr.Wood, and are now in the British
Museum.They must have been the sixteen at either end and the four in
the pronaos, shown darker in the woodcut.From the temple standing on a platform so much larger than appears
necessary, it is probable that pedestals with statues stood in front of
each column, and if this were so, the sculptures, with the columnæ
cælatæ and the noble architecture of the temple itself, must have made
up a combination of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic art such as hardly
existed anywhere else, and which consequently the ancients were quite
justified in considering as one of the wonders of the world.MUNICIPAL ARCHITECTURE.Very little now remains of all the various classes of municipal and
domestic buildings which must once have covered the land of Greece, and
from what we know of the exquisite feelings for art that pervaded that
people, they were certainly not less beautiful, though more ephemeral,
than the sacred buildings whose ruins still remain to us.There are, however, two buildings in Athens which, though small, give us
most exalted ideas of their taste in such matters.The first, already
alluded to, usually known as the Tower of the Winds, is a plain
octagonal building about 45 ft.in height by 24 in width, ornamented by
2 small porches of 2 pillars each, of the Corinthian order, the capitals
of which are represented in Woodcut No.Its roof, like the rest of
the building, is of white marble, and of simple but very elegant design,
and below this is a frieze of 8 large figures, symbolical of the 8
winds, from which the tower takes its name, they in fact being the
principal objects and ornaments of the building, the most important use
of which appears to have been to contain a clepsydra or water-clock.The other building, though smaller, is still more beautiful.It is known
as the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, and consists of a square base 12
ft.wide, on which stands a circular temple adorned by 6
Corinthian columns, which, with their entablature and the roof and
pedestal they support, make up 22 ft.more, so that the whole height of
the monument is only 34 ft.Notwithstanding these insignificant
dimensions, the beauty of its columns (Woodcut No.143) and of their
entablature—above all, the beauty of the roof and of the finial
ornament, which crowns the whole and is unrivalled for elegance even in
Greek art—make up a composition so perfect that nothing in any other
style or age can be said to surpass it.[151] If this is a fair index of
the art that was lavished on the smaller objects, the temples hardly
give a just idea of all that have perished.In extreme contrast with the buildings last described, which were among
the smallest, came the theatres, which were the largest, of the
monuments the Greeks seem ever to have attempted.The annexed plan of one at Dramyssus, the ancient Dodona, will give an
idea of their forms and arrangements.Its dimensions may be said to be
gigantic, being 443 ft.across; but even this, though perhaps the
largest in Greece, is far surpassed by many in Asia Minor.What remains
of it, however, is merely the auditorium, and consists only of ranges of
seats arranged in a semicircle, but without architectural ornament.In
all the examples in Europe, the proscenium,[152] which was the only part
architecturally ornamented, has perished, so that, till we can restore
this with something like certainty, the theatres hardly come within the
class of Architecture as a fine art.The theatre of Dionysus at Athens, which was excavated and laid bare in
1862-63, measures only 165 ft.Built on the south
side of the Acropolis, the natural <DW72> forming the rising ground was
utilised for the foundations of the tiers of seats which, in some cases,
and particularly at the back, were hewn in the rock; so that they were
carried back 294 ft.In the theatre of
Epidaurus, which, according to Pausanias, was the most beautiful theatre
in the world, the lines of the seats are continued on each side of the
orchestra so as to form a horse-shoe on plan; the foundations of the
stage, the projecting side wings with staircases on each side, and other
buildings belonging to the stage are still preserved.In Asia Minor some of the theatres have their proscenia adorned with
niches and columns, and friezes of great richness; but all these belong
to the Roman period, and, though probably copies of the mode in which
the Greeks ornamented theirs, are so corrupt in style as to prevent
their being used with safety in attempting to restore the earlier
examples.Many circumstances would indeed induce us to believe that the proscenia
of the earlier theatres may have been of wood or bronze, or both
combined, and heightened by painting and carving to a great degree of
richness.This, though appropriate and consonant with the origin and
history of the drama, would be fatal to the expectation of anything
being found to illustrate its earliest forms.Like the other Aryan races, the Greeks never were tomb-builders, and
nothing of any importance of this class is found in Greece, except the
tombs of the early Pelasgic races, which were either tumuli, or
treasuries, as they are popularly called.There are, it is true, some
headstones and small pillars of great beauty, but they are monolithic,
and belong rather to the department of Sculpture than of Architecture.In Asia Minor there are some important tombs, some built and others cut
in the rock.Some of the latter have been described before in speaking
of the tombs of the Lycians.The built examples which remain almost all
belong to the Roman period, though the typical and by far the most
splendid example of Greek tombs was that erected by Artemisia to the
memory of her husband Mausolus at Halicarnassus.We scarcely know enough
of the ethnic relations of the Carians to be able to understand what
induced them to adopt so exceptional a mode of doing honour to their
dead.With pure Greeks it must have been impossible, but the inhabitants
of these coasts were of a different race, and had a different mode of
expressing their feelings.View of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, as restored
by the Author.]Till Sir Charles Newton’s visit to Halicarnassus in 1856 the very site
of this seventh wonder of the world was a matter of dispute.We now know
enough to be able to restore the principal parts with absolute
certainty, and to ascertain its dimensions and general appearance within
very insignificant limits of error.[153]

The dimensions quoted by Pliny[154] are evidently extracted from a
larger work, said to have been written by the architect who erected it,
and which existed at his time.Every one of them has been confirmed in
the most satisfactory manner by recent discoveries, and enable us to put
the whole together without much hesitation.Plan of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, from a
Drawing by the Author.Sufficient remains of the quadriga, which crowned the monument, have
been brought home to give its dimensions absolutely.All the parts of
the Ionic order are complete.The steps of the pyramid have been found
and portions of the three friezes, and these, with Pliny’s dimensions
and description, are all that are required to assure us that its aspect
must have been very similar to the form represented in Woodcut No.There can be little doubt with regard to the upper storey, but in order
to work out to the dimensions given by Pliny (411 ft.in circumference)
and those found cut out in the rock (462 ft.), the lower storey must be
spread out beyond the upper to that extent, and most probably something
after the manner shown in the woodcut.The building consisted internally of two chambers superimposed the one
on the other, each 52 ft.by 42 ft.—the lower one being the
vestibule to the tomb beyond—the upper was surrounded by a peristyle of
36 columns.Externally the height was divided into three equal portions
of 37 ft.each (25 cubits), one of which was allotted to the
base—one to the pyramid with its meta—and one to the order between them.These with 14 ft., the height of the quadriga, and the same dimension
belonging to the lower entablature, made up the height of 140 Greek
feet[155] given it by Pliny.Though its height was unusually great for a Greek building, its other
dimensions were small.The admiration
therefore which the Greeks expressed regarding it must have arisen,
first, from the unusual nature of its design and of the purpose to which
it was applied, or perhaps more still from the extent and richness of
its sculptured decorations, of the beauty of which we are now enabled to
judge, and can fully share with them in admiring.Another, but very much smaller, tomb of about the same age was found by
Mr.Newton at Cnidus, and known as the Lion Tomb, from the figure of
that animal, now in the British Museum, which crowned its summit.Like
many other tombs found in Asia and in Africa, it follows the type of the
Mausoleum in its more important features.It possesses a base—a
peristyle—a pyramid of steps—and, lastly, an acroterion or pedestal
meant to support a quadriga or statue, or some other crowning object,
which appropriately terminated the design upwards.Several examples erected during the Roman period will be illustrated
when speaking of the architecture of that people, all bearing the
impress of the influence the Mausoleum had on the tomb architecture of
that age; but unfortunately we cannot yet go backwards and point out the
type from which the design of the Mausoleum itself was elaborated.The
tombs of Babylon and Passargadæ are remote both geographically and
artistically, though not without certain essential resemblances.Perhaps
the missing links may some day reward the industry of some scientific
explorer.At Cyrene there is a large group of tombs of Grecian date and with
Grecian details, but all cut in the rock, and consequently differing
widely in their form from those just described.It is not clear whether
the circumstance of this city possessing such a necropolis arose from
its proximity to Egypt, and consequently from a mere desire to imitate
that people, or from some ethnic peculiarity.Most probably the latter,
though we know so little about them that it is difficult to speak with
precision on such a subject.[156]

These tombs are chiefly interesting from many of the details of the
architecture still retaining the colour with which they were originally
adorned.The triglyphs of the Doric order are still painted blue,[157]
as appears to have been the universal practice, and the pillars are
outlined by red lines.The metopes are darker, and are adorned with
painted groups of figures, the whole making up one of the most perfect
examples of Grecian  decoration which still remain.Rock-cut and structural Tombs at Cyrene.(From
Hamilton’s ‘Wanderings in North Africa.’)]

There is another tomb at the same place—this time structural—which is
interesting not so much for any architectural beauty it possesses as
from its belonging to an exceptional type.It consists now only of a
circular basement—the upper part is gone—and is erected over an
excavated rock-cut tomb.There seem to be several others of the same
class in the necropolis, and they are the only examples known except
those at Marathos, one of which is illustrated above (Woodcut No.As before hinted, the Syrian example does not appear to be very ancient,
but we want further information before speaking positively on this
subject.No one on the spot has attempted to fix with precision the age
of the Cyrenean examples; nor have they been drawn in such detail as is
requisite for others to ascertain the fact.They may be as late as the
time of the Romans, but can hardly be dated as prior to the age of
Alexander the Great.(From Hamilton’s ‘North Africa.’)]


                         DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.We have nothing left but imperfect verbal descriptions of the domestic,
and even of the palatial architecture of Greece, and, consequently, can
only judge imperfectly of its forms.Unfortunately, too, Pompeii, though
but half a Greek city, belongs to too late and too corrupt an age to
enable us to use it even as an illustration; but we may rest assured
that in this, as in everything else, the Greeks displayed the same
exquisite taste which pervades not only their monumental architecture,
but all their works in metal or clay, down to the meanest object, which
have been preserved to our times.It is probable that the forms of their houses were much more irregular
and picturesque than we are in the habit of supposing them to have been.They seem to have taken such pains in their temples—in the Erechtheium,
for instance, and at Eleusis—to make every part tell its own tale, that
anything like forced regularity must have been offensive to them, and
they would probably make every apartment exactly of the dimensions
required, and group them so that no one should under any circumstances
be confounded with another.This, however, with all the details of their domestic arts, must now
remain to us as mere speculation, and the architectural history of
Greece must be confined to her temples and monumental erections.These
suffice to explain the nature and forms of the art, and to assign to it
the rank of the purest and most intellectual of all the styles which
have yet been invented or practised in any part of the world.ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

The ethnographical history of art in Italy is in all its essential
features similar to that of Greece, though arriving at widely different
results from causes the influence of which it is easy to trace.Both are
examples of an Aryan development based on a Turanian civilisation which
it has superseded.In Greece—as already remarked—the traces of the
earlier people are indistinct and difficult to seize.In Italy their
features are drawn with a coarser hand, and extend down into a more
essentially historic age.It thus happens that we have no doubt as to
the existence of the Etruscan people—we know very nearly who they were,
and cannot be mistaken as to the amount and kind of influence they
exercised on the institutions and arts of the Romans.The more striking differences appear to have arisen from the fact, that
Greece had some four or five centuries of comparative repose during
which to form herself and her institutions after the Pelasgic
civilisation was struck down at the time of the Dorian occupation of the
Peloponnesus.During that period she was undisturbed by foreign
invasion, and was not tempted by successful conquests to forsake the
gentler social arts for the more vulgar objects of national ambition.Rome’s history, on the other hand, from the earliest aggregation of a
robber horde on the banks of the Tiber till she became the arbiter of
the destinies of the ancient world, is little beyond the record of
continuous wars.From the possession of the seven hills, Rome gradually
carried her sway at the edge of the sword to the dominion of the whole
of Italy and of all the then known world, destroying everything that
stood in the way of her ambition, and seeking only the acquisition of
wealth and power.Greece, in the midst of her successful cultivation of the arts of
commerce and of peace, stimulated by the wholesome rivalry of the
different States of which she was composed, was awakened by the Persian
invasion to a struggle for existence.The result was one of the most
brilliant passages in the world’s history, and no nation was ever more
justified in the jubilant outburst of enthusiastic patriotism that
followed the repulse of the invader, than was Greece in that with which
she commenced her short but brilliant career.A triumph so gained by a
people so constituted led to results at which we still wonder, though
they cause us no surprise.If Greece attained her manhood on the
battle-fields of Marathon and Salamis, Rome equally reached the maturity
of her career when she cruelly and criminally destroyed Corinth and
Carthage, and the sequel was such as might be expected from such a
difference of education.Rome had no time for the cultivation of the
arts of peace, and as little sympathy for their gentler influences.Conquest, wealth, and consequent power, were the objects of her
ambition—for these she sacrificed everything, and by their means she
attained a pinnacle of greatness that no nation had reached before or
has since.Her arts have all the impress of this greatness, and are
characterised by the same vulgar grandeur which marks everything she
did.Very different they are from the intellectual beauty found in the
works of the Greeks, but in some respects they are as interesting to
those who can read the character of nations in their artistic
productions.In the earlier part of her career Rome was an Etruscan city under
Etruscan kings and institutions.After she had emancipated herself from
their yoke, Etruria long remained her equal and her rival in political
power, and her instructress in religion and the arts of peace.This
continued so long, and the architectural remains of that people are so
numerous, and have been so thoroughly investigated, that we have no
difficulty in ascertaining the extent of influence the older nation had
on the nascent empire.It is more difficult to ascertain exactly who the
Etruscans themselves were, or whence they came.But on the whole there
seems every reason to believe they migrated from Asia Minor some twelve
or thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and fixed themselves in
Italy, most probably among the Umbrians, or some people of cognate race,
who had settled there before—so long before, perhaps, as to entitle them
to be considered among the aboriginal inhabitants.It would have been only natural that the expatriated Trojans should have
sought refuge among such a kindred people, though we have nothing but
the vaguest tradition to warrant a belief that this was the case.They
may too from time to time have received other accessions to their
strength; but they were a foreign people in a strange land, and scarcely
seem ever to have become naturalised in the country of their adoption.But what stood still more in their way was the fact that they were an
old Turanian people in presence of a young and ambitious community of
Aryan origin, and, as has always been the case when this has happened,
they were destined to disappear.Before doing so, however, they left
their impress on the institutions and the arts of their conquerors to
such an extent as to be still traceable in every form.It may have been
that there was as much Pelasgic blood in the veins of the Greeks as
there was Etruscan in those of the Romans; but the civilisation of the
former had passed away before Greece had developed herself.Etruria, on
the other hand, was long contemporary with Rome: in early times her
equal, and sometimes her mistress, and consequently in a position to
force her arts upon her to an extent that was never effected on the
opposite shore of the Adriatic.Nothing can prove more clearly the Turanian origin of the Etruscans than
the fact that all we know of them is derived from their tombs.These
exist in hundreds—it may almost be said in thousands—at the gates of
every city; but no vestige of a temple has come down to our days.Had
any Semitic blood flowed in their veins, as has been sometimes
suspected, they could not have been so essentially sepulchral as they
were, or so fond of contemplating death, as is proved by the fact that a
purely Semitic tomb is still a desideratum among antiquaries, not one
having as yet been discovered.What we should like to find in Etruria
would be a square pyramidal mound with external steps leading to a cella
on its summit; but no trace of any such has yet been detected.Their
other temples—using the word in the sense in which we usually understand
it—were, as might be expected, insignificant and ephemeral.So much so,
indeed, that except from one passage in Vitruvius,[158] and our being
able to detect the influence of the Etruscan style in the buildings of
Imperial Rome, we should hardly be aware of their existence.The truth
seems to be that the religion of the Etruscans, like that of most of
their congeners, was essentially ancestral, and their worship took the
form of respect for the remains of the dead and reverence for their
memory.Tombs consequently, and not temples, were the objects on which
they lavished their architectural resources.They certainly were not
idolaters, in the sense in which we usually understand the term.They
had no distinct or privileged priesthood, and consequently had no motive
for erecting temples which by their magnificence should be pleasing to
their gods or tend to the glorification of their kings or priests.Still
less were they required for congregational purposes by the people at
large.The only individual temple of Etruscan origin of which we have any
knowledge, is that of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome.[159] Originally small,
it was repaired and rebuilt till it became under the Empire a splendid
fane.But not one vestige of it now remains, nor any description from
which we could restore its appearance with anything like certainty.From the chapter of the work of Vitruvius just alluded to, we learn that
the Etruscans had two classes of temples: one circular, like their
structural tombs, and dedicated to one deity; the other class
rectangular, but these, always possessing three cells, were devoted to
the worship of three gods.Plan and Elevation of an Etruscan Temple.]The general arrangement of the plan, as described by Vitruvius, was that
shown on the plan above (Fig.1), and is generally assented to by all
those who have attempted the restoration.In larger temples in Roman
times the number of pillars in front may have been doubled, and they
would thus be arranged like those of the portico of the Pantheon, which
is essentially an Etruscan arrangement.The restoration of the elevation
is more difficult, and the argument too long to be entered upon
here;[160] but its construction and proportions seem to have been very
much like those drawn in the above diagram (Fig.Of course, as
wooden structures, they were richly and elaborately carved, and the
effect heightened by colours, but it is in vain to attempt to restore
them.Without a single example to guide us, and with very little
collateral evidence which can at all be depended upon, it is hardly
possible that any satisfactory restoration could now be made.Moreover,
their importance in the history of art is so insignificant, that the
labour such an attempt must involve would hardly be repaid by the
result.The original Etruscan circular temple seems to have been a mere circular
cell with a porch.The Romans surrounded it with a peristyle, which
probably did not exist in the original style.They magnified it
afterwards into the most characteristic and splendid of all their
temples, the Pantheon, whose portico is Etruscan in arrangement and
design, and whose cell still more distinctly belongs to that order; nor
can there be any doubt that the simpler Roman temples of circular form
are derived from Etruscan originals.[161] It would therefore be of great
importance if we could illustrate the later buildings from existing
remains of the older: but the fact is that such deductions as we may
draw from the copies are our only source of information respecting the
originals.We know little of any of the civil buildings with which the cities of
Etruria were adorned, beyond the knowledge obtained from the remains of
their theatres and amphitheatres.The form of the latter was essentially
Etruscan, and was adopted by the Romans, with whom it became their most
characteristic and grandest architectural object.Of the amphitheatres
of ancient Etruria only one now remains in so perfect a state as to
enable us to judge of their forms.It is that at Sutrium, which,
however, being entirely cut in the rock, neither affords information as
to the mode of construction nor enables us to determine its age.in its greatest length by 265 in breadth,
and it is consequently much nearer a circular form than the Romans
generally adopted: but in other respects the arrangements are such as
appear to have usually prevailed in after times.Besides these, we have numerous works of utility, but these belong more
strictly to engineering than to architectural science.The city walls of
the Etruscans surpass those of any other ancient nation in extent and
beauty of workmanship.Their drainage works and their bridges, as well
as those of the kindred Pelasgians in Greece, still remain monuments of
their industrial science and skill, which their successors never
surpassed.On the whole, perhaps we are justified in asserting that the Etruscans
were not an architectural people, and had no temples or palaces worthy
of attention.It at least seems certain that nothing of the sort is now
to be found, even in ruins, and were it not that the study of Etruscan
art is a necessary introduction to that of Roman, it would hardly be
worth while trying to gather together and illustrate the few fragments
and notices of it that remain.The tombs of the Etruscans now found may be divided into two
classes—first, those cut in the rock, and resembling dwelling-houses;
secondly, the circular tumuli, which latter are by far the most numerous
and important class.Each of these may be again subdivided into two kinds.The rock-cut tombs
include, firstly, those with only a façade on the face of the rock and a
sepulchral chamber within; secondly, those cut quite out of the rock and
standing free all round.To this class probably once belonged an immense
number of tombs built in the ordinary way; but all these have totally
disappeared, and consequently the class, as now under consideration,
consists entirely of excavated examples.The second class may be divided into those tumuli erected over chambers
cut in the tufaceous rock which is found all over Etruria, and those
which have chambers built above-ground.In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say which of
these classes is the older.We know that the Egyptians buried in caves
long before the Etruscans landed in Italy, and at the same time raised
pyramids over rock-cut and built chambers.We know too that Abraham was
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Syria.On the other hand, the tombs
at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113), the treasuries of Mycenæ (Woodcut No.124),
the sepulchre of Alyattes (Woodcut No.115), and many others, are proofs
of the antiquity of the tumuli, which are found all over Europe and
Asia, and appear to have existed from the earliest ages.The comparative antiquity of the different kinds of tombs being thus
doubtful, it will be sufficient for the purposes of the present work to
classify them architecturally.It may probably be assumed, with safety,
that all the modes which have been enumerated were practised by the
Etruscans at a period very slightly subsequent to their migration into
Italy.Of the first class of the rock-cut tombs—those with merely a façade
externally—the most remarkable group is that at Castel d’Asso.At this
place there is a perpendicular cliff with hundreds of these tombs ranged
along its face, like houses in a street.A similar arrangement is found
in Egypt at Benihasan, at Petra, and Cyrene, and around all the more
ancient cities of Asia Minor.In Etruria they generally consist of one chamber lighted by the doorway
only.Their internal arrangement appears to be an imitation of a
dwelling chamber, with furniture, like the apartment itself, cut out of
the rock.Externally they have little or no pretension to architectural
decoration.It is true that some tombs are found adorned with
frontispieces of a debased Doric or Ionic order; but these were executed
at a much later period and under Roman domination, and cannot therefore
be taken as specimens of Etruscan art, but rather of that corruption of
style sure to arise from a conquered people trying to imitate the arts
of their rulers.Tombs at Castel d’Asso.(From the ‘Annale del
Instituto.’)]

The general appearance of the second class of rock-cut tombs will be
understood from the woodcut (No.168), representing two monuments at
Castel d’Asso.Unfortunately neither is complete, nor is there any
complete example known to exist of this class.Perhaps the apex was
added structurally and that these, like all such things in Etruria, have
perished.Possibly, if cut in the rock, the terminals were slender
carved ornaments, and therefore liable to injury.They are usually
restored by antiquaries in the shape of rectilinear pyramids, but so far
as I know, there is no authority for this.On the contrary, it is more
in accordance with what we know of the style and its affinities to
suppose that the termination of these monuments, even if added in
masonry, was curvilinear.Mouldings from Tombs at Castel d’Asso.]One remarkable thing about the rock-cut tombs is the form of their
mouldings, which differ from any found elsewhere in Europe.Two of these
are shown in the annexed woodcut (No.They are very numerous and
in great variety, but do not in any instance show the slightest trace of
a cornice, nor of any tendency towards one.On the contrary, in place of
this, we find nothing but a reverse moulding.It is probable that
similar forms may be found in Asia Minor, while something resembling
them actually occurs at Persepolis and elsewhere.It is remarkable that
this feature did not penetrate to Rome, and that no trace of its
influence is found there, as might have been expected.[162]


                                TUMULI.The simplest, and therefore perhaps the earliest, monument which can be
erected over the graves of the dead, by a people who reverence their
departed relatives, is a mound of earth or a cairn of stones, and such
seems to have been the form adopted by the Turanian or Tartar races of
mankind from the earliest days to the present hour.It is scarcely
necessary to remark how universal such monuments were among the ruder
tribes of Northern Europe.The Etruscans improved upon this by
surrounding the base with a _podium_, or supporting wall of masonry.This not only defined its limits and gave it dignity, but enabled
entrances to be made in it, and otherwise converted it from a mere
hillock into a monumental structure.It is usually supposed that this
basement was an invariable part of all Etruscan tumuli, and when it is
not found, it is assumed that it has been removed, or that it is buried
in the rubbish of the mound.No doubt such a stone basement may easily
have been removed by the peasantry, or buried, but it is by no means
clear that this was invariably the case.It seems that the enclosure was
frequently a circle of stones or monumental steles, in the centre of
which the tumulus stood.The monuments have hitherto been so carelessly
examined and restored, that it is difficult to arrive at anything like
certainty with regard to the details of their structure.Nor can we draw
any certain conclusion from a comparison with other tumuli of cognate
races.The description by Herodotus of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis
(Woodcut No.115), those described by Pausanias as existing in the
Peloponnesus, and the appearances of those at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
might be interpreted either way; but those at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113),
and a great number at least of those in Etruria, have a structural
circle of stone as a supporting base to the mound.Plan of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.These tumuli are found existing in immense numbers in every necropolis
of the Etruscans.A large space was generally set apart for the purpose
outside the walls of all their great cities.In these cemeteries the
tumuli are arranged in rows, like houses in streets.Even now we can
count them by hundreds, and in the neighbourhood of the largest
cities—at Vulci, for instance—almost by thousands.Most of them are now worn down by the effect of time to nearly the level
of the ground, though some of the larger ones still retain an imposing
appearance.Nearly all have been rifled at some early period, though the
treasures still discovered almost daily in some places show how vast
their extent was, and how much even now remains to be done before this
vast mine of antiquity can be said to be exhausted.One of the most remarkable among those that have been opened in modern
times is at Cervetri, the ancient Cære, known as the Regulini Galeassi
tomb, from the names of its discoverers.Sections of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.(From
Canina’s ‘Etruria Antica.’) Scale for large section, 50 ft.Like a Nubian pyramid or Buddhist tope, it consists of an inner and
older tumulus, around and over which another has been added.In the
outer mound are five tombs either of dependent or inferior personages.These were rifled long ago; but the outer pyramid having effectually
concealed the entrance to the principal tomb, it remained untouched till
very lately, when it yielded to its discoverers a richer collection of
ornaments and utensils in gold and bronze than has ever been found in
one place before.The dimensions and arrangements of this tumulus will be understood from
Woodcuts Nos.170, 171, and from the two sections of the principal tomb
which are annexed to them.These last display an irregularity of
construction very unusual in such cases, for which no cause can be
assigned.The usual section is perfectly regular, as in the annexed
woodcut (No.172), taken from another tomb at the same place.These chambers, like all those of the early Etruscans, are vaulted on
the horizontal principle, like the tombs at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
though none are found in Italy at all equal to those of Greece in
dimensions or beauty of construction.173 is a perspective view of the principal chamber in the
Regulini Galeassi tomb, showing the position of the furniture found in
it when first opened, consisting of biers or bedsteads, shields, arrows,
and vessels of various sorts.A number of vases are hung in a curious
recess in the roof, the form of which would be inexplicable but for the
utensils found in it.With this clue to its meaning we can scarcely
doubt that it represents a place for hanging such vessels in the houses
of the living.All the treasures found in this tomb are in the oldest style of Etruscan
art, and are so similar to the bronzes and ornaments brought by Layard
from Assyria as to lead to the belief that they had a common origin.The
tomb, with its contents, probably dates from the 9th or 10th century
before the Christian era.The largest tomb hitherto discovered in Etruria is now known as the
Cocumella, in the necropolis at Vulci.in
diameter, and originally could not have been less than 115 or 120 ft.in
height, though now it only rises to 50 ft.View of principal Chamber in the Regulini Galeassi
Tomb.]Near its centre are the remains of two solid towers, one circular, the
other square, neither of them actually central, nor are they placed in
such a way that we can understand how they can have formed a part of any
symmetrical design.A plan and a view of the present appearance of this
monument are given in Woodcuts 174 and 175.This tumulus, with its principal remaining features thus standing on one
side of the centre, may possibly assist us to understand the curious
description found in Pliny[163] of the tomb of Porsenna.This
description is quoted from Varro, being evidently regarded by Pliny
himself as not a little apocryphal.According to this account it
consisted of a square basement 300 ft.each way, from which arose five
pyramids, united at the summit by a bronze circle or cupola.This was
again surmounted by four other pyramids, the summits of which were again
united at a height of 300 ft.From this point rose
still five more pyramids, whose height Varro (from modesty, as Pliny
surmises) omits to state, but which was estimated in Etruscan traditions
at the same height as the rest of the monument.This last statement,
which does not rest on any real authority, may well be regarded as
exaggerated; but if we take the total height as about 400 ft., it is
easy to understand that in the age of Pliny, when all the buildings were
low, such a structure, as high as the steeple at Salisbury, would appear
fabulous; but the vast piles that have been erected by tomb-building
races in other parts of the earth render it by no means improbable that
Varro was justified in what he asserted.[164]

Near the gate of Albano is found a small tomb of five pyramidal pillars
rising from a square base, exactly corresponding with Varro’s
description of the lower part of the tomb of Porsenna.It is called by
tradition the tomb of Aruns, the son of Porsenna, though the character
of the mouldings with which it is adorned would lead us to assign to it
a more modern date.It consists of a lofty podium, on which are placed
five pyramids, a large one in the centre and four smaller ones at the
angles.Its present appearance is shown in the annexed woodcut (No.There are not in Etruria any features sufficiently marked to
characterise a style of architecture, nor any pillars with their
accessories which can be considered to constitute an order.It is true
that in some of the rock-cut tombs square piers support the roof; and in
one or two instances rounded pillars are found, but these are either
without mouldings or ornamented only with Roman details, betraying the
lateness of their execution.The absence of built examples of the class
of tombs found in the rock prevents us from recognising any of those
peculiarities of construction which sometimes are as characteristic of
the style and as worthy of attention as the more purely ornamental
parts.From their city gates, their aqueducts and bridges, we know that the
Etruscans used the radiating arch at an early age, with deep voussoirs
and elegant mouldings, giving it that character of strength which the
Romans afterwards imparted to their works of the same class.The Cloaca
Maxima of Rome (Woodcut No.104) must be considered as a work executed
under Etruscan superintendence, and a very perfect specimen of the
class.At the same time the Etruscans used the pointed arch, constructed
horizontally, and seem to have had the same predilection for it which
characterised the cognate Pelasgian race in Greece.A gateway at Arpino
(Woodcut No.177) is almost identical with that at Thoricus (Woodcut No.126), but larger and more elegant; and there are many specimens of the
same class found in Italy.The portion of an aqueduct at Tusculum, shown
in Woodcut No.178, is a curious transition specimen, where the two
stones meeting at the apex (usually called the Egyptian form, being the
first step towards the true arch) are combined with a substructure of
horizontal converging masonry.In either of these instances the horizontal arch is a legitimate mode of
construction, and may have been used long after the principle of the
radiating arch was known.The great convenience of the latter, as
enabling large spaces to be spanned even with brick or the smallest
stones, and thus dispensing with the necessity for stones of very large
dimensions, led ultimately to its universal adoption.Subsequently, when
the pointed form of the radiating arch was introduced, no motive
remained for the retention of the horizontal method, and it was entirely
abandoned.We now approach the last revolution that completed and closed the great
cycle of the arts and civilisation of the ancient world.We have seen
Art spring Minerva-like, perfect from the head of her great parent, in
Egypt.We have admired it in Assyria, rich, varied, but unstable; aiming
at everything, but never attaining maturity or perfection.We have tried
to trace the threads of early Pelasgic art in Asia, Greece, and Etruria,
spreading their influence over the world, and laying the foundation of
other arts which the Pelasgi were incapable of developing.We have seen
all these elements gathered together in Greece, the essence extracted
from each, and the whole forming the most perfect and beautiful
combinations of intellectual power that the world has yet witnessed.We
have now only to contemplate the last act in the great drama, the
gorgeous but melancholy catastrophe by which all these styles of
architecture were collected in wild confusion in Rome, and there
perished beneath the luxury and crimes of that mighty people, who for a
while made Rome the capital of Europe.View them as we will, the arts of Rome were never an indigenous or
natural production of the soil or people, but an aggregation of foreign
styles in a state of transition from the old and time-honoured forms of
Pagan antiquity to the new development introduced by Christianity.We
cannot of course suppose that the Romans foresaw the result to which
their amalgamation of previous styles was tending; still they advanced
as steadily towards that result as if a prophetic spirit had guided them
to a well-defined conception of what was to be.It was not however
permitted to the Romans to complete this task.Long before the ancient
methods and ideas had been completely moulded into the new, the power of
Rome sank beneath her corruption, and a long pause took place, during
which the Christian arts did not advance in Western Europe beyond the
point they had reached in the age of Constantine.Indeed, in many
respects, they receded from it during the dark ages.When they
reappeared in the 10th and 11th centuries it was in an entirely new garb
and with scarcely a trace of their origin—so distinct indeed that it
appears more like a reinvention than a reproduction of forms long since
familiar to the Roman world.Had Rome retained her power and
pre-eminence a century or two longer, a style might have been elaborated
as distinct from that of the ancient world, and as complete in itself,
as our pointed Gothic, and perhaps more beautiful.Such was not the
destiny of the world; and what we have now to do is to examine this
transition style as we find it in ancient Rome, and familiarise
ourselves with the forms it took during the three centuries of its
existence, as without this knowledge all the arts of the Gothic era
would for ever remain an inexplicable mystery.The chief value of the
Roman style consists in the fact that it contains the germs of all that
is found in the Middle Ages, and affords the key by which its mysteries
may be unlocked, and its treasures rendered available.Had the
transition been carried through in the hands of an art-loving and
artistic people, the architectural beauties of Rome must have surpassed
those of any other city in the world, for its buildings surpass in scale
those of Egypt and in variety those of Greece, while they affect to
combine the beauties of both.In constructive ingenuity they far surpass
anything the world had seen up to that time, but this cannot redeem
offences against good taste, nor enable any Roman productions to command
our admiration as works of art, or entitle them to rank as models to be
followed either literally or in spirit.During the first two centuries and a half of her existence, Rome was
virtually an Etruscan city, wholly under Etruscan influence; and during
that period we read of temples and palaces being built and of works of
immense magnitude being undertaken for the embellishment of the city;
and we have even now more remains of kingly than we have of consular
Rome.After expelling her kings and shaking off Etruscan influence, Rome
existed as a republic for five centuries, and during this long age of
barbarism she did nothing to advance science or art.Literature was
almost wholly unknown within her walls, and not one monument has come
down to our time, even by tradition, worthy of a city of a tenth part of
her power and magnitude.There is probably no instance in the history of
the world of a capital city existing so long, populous and peaceful at
home, prosperous and powerful abroad, and at the same time so utterly
devoid of any monuments or any magnificence to dignify her existence.When, however, Carthage was conquered and destroyed, when Greece was
overrun and plundered, and Egypt, with her long-treasured art, had
become a dependent province, Rome was no longer the city of the Aryan
Romans, but the sole capital of the civilised world.Into her lap were
poured all the artistic riches of the universe; to Rome flocked all who
sought a higher distinction or a more extended field for their ambition
than their own provincial capitals could then afford.She thus became
the centre of all the arts and of all the science then known; and, so
far at least as quantity is concerned, she amply redeemed her previous
neglect of them.It seems an almost indisputable fact that, during the
three centuries of the Empire, more and larger buildings were erected in
Rome and her dependent cities than ever were erected in a like period in
any part of the world.For centuries before the establishment of the Roman Empire, progressive
development and increasing population, joined to comparative peace and
security, had accumulated around the shores of the Mediterranean a mass
of people enjoying material prosperity greater than had ever been known
before.All this culminated in the first centuries of the Christian era.The greatness of the ancient world was then full, and a more
overwhelming and gorgeous spectacle than the Roman Empire then displayed
never dazzled the eyes of mankind.From the banks of the Euphrates to
those of the Tagus, every city vied with its neighbour in the erection
of temples, baths, theatres, and edifices for public use or private
luxury.In all cases these display far more evidence of wealth and power
than of taste and refinement, and all exhibit traces of that haste to
enjoy, which seems incompatible with the correct elaboration of anything
that is to be truly great.Notwithstanding all this, there is a
greatness in the mass, a grandeur in the conception, and a certain
expression of power in all these Roman remains which never fail to
strike the beholder with awe and force admiration from him despite his
better judgment.These qualities, coupled with the associations that
attach themselves to every brick and every stone, render the study of
them irresistibly attractive.It was with Imperial Rome that the ancient
world perished; it was in her dominions that the new and Christian world
was born.All that was great in Heathendom was gathered within her
walls, tied, it is true, into an inextricable knot, which was cut by the
sword of those barbarians who moulded for themselves out of the
fragments that polity and those arts which will next occupy our
attention.To Rome all previous history tends; from Rome all modern
history springs: to her, therefore, and to her arts, we inevitably turn,
if not to admire, at least to learn, and if not to imitate, at any rate
to wonder at and to contemplate a phase of art as unknown to previous as
to subsequent history, and, if properly understood, more replete with
instruction than any other form hitherto known.Though the lesson we
learn from it is far oftener what to avoid than what to follow, still
there is such wisdom to be gathered from it as should guide us in the
onward path, which may lead us to a far higher grade than it was given
to Rome herself ever to attain.Origin of style—The arch—Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be
called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country
previously occupied by Pelasgians.Their principal neighbour on one side
was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation.On the other hand was Magna Græcia,
which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of
kindred origin.It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the
Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two
people.As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of
both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries
afterwards.Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,
and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in
Roman architecture to its origin.From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with
its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used
it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being
sufficiently large for their purposes.The principal Etruscan temples,
as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half
occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the
portico never extended.The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of
these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its
breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the
building.Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,
but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though
frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns
attached to its walls.Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a
circular form of temple.As applied by the Romans it was generally
encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the
Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from
the Greeks on an Etruscan form.In early times these circular temples
were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown
or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this
distinction was lost sight of.A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the
Etruscans was the circular arch.It was known, it is true, to the
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps
excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their
ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and
introduced it into almost all their buildings.It was not at first used
in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones.In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was
generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders.In the
Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless
network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their
entablatures, is spread over the whole.This is a curious instance of
the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of
Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns
would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some
expedient more correctly constructive.After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the
arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in
advance by applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular
forms of buildings.The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of
the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple
of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so
distant in date.In these buildings the Roman architects so completely
emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to
entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture.It
would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to
the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for
boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the
new method ought to be applied.This is almost universally acknowledged
so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned.In simple grandeur
it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail.It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in
its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet
remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been
quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more
familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately
as the simpler dome of the Pantheon.These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to
which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of
architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors.It
may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman
architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the
semi-Oriental nation seized on its own circular form, and, modifying and
moulding it to its purpose, wrought out the Byzantine style; in which
the dome is the great feature, almost to the total exclusion of the
rectangular form with its intersecting vaults.On the other hand, the
rectangular form was appropriated by the nations of the West with an
equally distinct rejection of the circular and domical forms, except in
those cases in which we find an Eastern people still incorporated with
them.Thus in Italy both styles continued long in use, the one in
baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in
Rome.In France they were so completely fused into each other that it
requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate
them again into their component parts.In England we rejected the
circular form altogether, and so they did eventually in Germany, except
when under French influence.Each race reclaimed its own among the
spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during
its employment in the Imperial city.The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the
numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of
purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles.In
Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs.In
Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in
Etruria to tombs.It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to
deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who
for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture
subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster.It thus
happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find
basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of
triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all
equally objects of architectural skill.The best of these, in fact, are
those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped
with originality.These would have been noble works indeed had it not
been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and
details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to
temples by other nations.In the time of Constantine these orders had
nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative
purposes.In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the
Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before
remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore
still remain an essential part of Roman art.We find the old orders
predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as
we approach that of Constantine.Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the
Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about
half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly simple order of
the Greeks.It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for
monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter.It was, however,
more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter
column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek
style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,
but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman.This fact was apparently
recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple
throughout the Roman world.It would in consequence be most unfair to
institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in
civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world
spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was
devoted to the highest religious purposes.The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally
useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the
other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal
object of its introduction.The keynote of Roman architecture was the
Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,
many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders
together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three
should be reduced to something like harmony.This was accordingly done,
but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in
combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our
admiration.The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the
Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric.They
never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed
it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two.In its own native
East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers
or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no
angles to be turned.When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples
of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at
each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to
one another.In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut
No.142) they used a capital with four faces.The Romans, impatient of
control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over
the extreme difficulty of its employment.With them the angular volutes
became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants
harmony and meaning.When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,
and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this
state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually
deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord
in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to
be found in Roman remains.The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from
that of the other two.The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme
of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have
become incapable of further improvement.The Corinthian, on the
contrary, was a recent conception; and although nothing can surpass the
elegance and grace with which the Greeks adorned it, the new capital
never acquired with them that fulness and strength so requisite to
render it an appropriate architectural ornament.These were added to it
by the Romans, or rather perhaps by Grecian artists acting under their
direction, who thus, as shown in Woodcut No.181, produced an order
which for richness combined with proportion and architectural fitness
has hardly been surpassed.The base is elegant and appropriate; the
shaft is of the most pleasing proportion, and the fluting gives it just
the requisite degree of richness and no more; while the capital, though
bordering on over-ornamentation, is so well arranged as to appear just
suited to the work it has to do.The acanthus-leaves, it is true,
approach the very verge of that degree of direct imitation of nature
which, though allowable in architectural ornaments, is seldom advisable;
they are, however, disposed so formally, and there still remains so much
that is conventional in them, that, though perhaps not justly open to
criticism on this account, they are nevertheless a very extreme example.The entablature is not so admirable as the column.The architrave is too
richly carved.It is evident, however, that this arose from the artist
having copied in carving what the Greeks had only painted, and thereby
produced a complexity far from pleasing.The frieze, as we now find it, is perfectly plain; but this undoubtedly
was not the case when originally erected.It either must have been
painted (in which case the whole order of course was also painted), or
ornamented with scrolls or figures in bronze, which may probably have
been gilt.The cornice is perhaps open to the same criticism as the architrave, of
being over-rich, though this evidently arose from the same cause, viz.,
reproducing in carving what was originally only painted; which to our
Northern eyes at least appears more appropriate for internal than for
external decoration, though, under the purer skies where it was
introduced and used, this remark may be hardly applicable.The order of the portico of the Pantheon is, according to our notions, a
nobler specimen of what an external pillar should be than that of the
Temple of Jupiter Stator.The shafts are of one block, unfluted; the
capital plainer; and the whole entablature, though as correctly
proportional, is far less ornamented and more suited to the greater
simplicity of the whole.The order of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina is another example
intermediate between these two.The columns are in this instance very
similar to those of the Pantheon, and the architrave is plain.The
frieze, however, is ornamented with more taste than any other in Rome,
and is a very pleasing example of those conventional representations of
plants and animals which are so well suited to architectural
purposes—more like Nature than those of the Greeks, but still avoiding
direct imitation sufficiently to escape the affectation of pretending to
appear what it is not and cannot be.The Maison Carrée at Nîmes presents an example of a frieze ornamented
with exquisite taste, while at Baalbec, and in some other examples, we
have them so over-ornamented that the effect is far more offensive, from
utter want of repose, than the frieze in the Temple of Jupiter Stator
ever could be from its baldness.Besides these there are at least fifty varieties of Corinthian capitals
to be found, either in Rome or in various parts of the Roman Empire, all
executed within the three centuries during which Rome continued to be
the imperial city.Some of them are remarkable for that elegant
simplicity which so evidently betrays the hand of a Grecian artist,
while others again show a lavish exuberance of ornament which is but too
characteristic of Roman art in general.Many, however, contain the germs
of something better than was accomplished in that age; and a collection
of them would afford more useful suggestions for designing capitals than
have yet been available to modern artists.Among their various attempts to improve the order which has just been
described, the Romans hit upon one which is extremely characteristic of
their whole style of art.This is known by the distinguishing name of
the Composite order, though virtually more like the typical examples of
the Corinthian order than many of those classed under the latter
denomination.The greatest defect of the Corinthian capital is the weakness of the
small volutes supporting the angles of the abacus.A true artist would
have remedied this by adding to their strength and carrying up the
fulness of the capital to the top.The Romans removed the whole of the
upper part and substituted an Ionic capital instead.Their only original
idea, if it may be so called, in art was that of putting two dissimilar
things together to make one which should combine the beauties of both,
though as a rule the one generally serves to destroy the other.In the
Composite capital they never could hide the junction; and consequently,
though rich, and in some respects an improvement on the order out of
which it grew, this capital never came into general use, and has seldom
found favour except amongst the blindest admirers of all that the Romans
did.Corinthian Base, found in Church of St.In the latter days of the Empire the Romans attempted another innovation
which promised far better success, and with very little more elaboration
would have been a great gain to the principles of architectural design.This was the introduction of the Persian or Assyrian base, modified to
suit the details of the Corinthian or Composite orders.If they had
always used this instead of the square pedestals on which they mounted
their columns, and had attenuated the pillars slightly when used with
arcades, they would have avoided many of the errors they fell into.This
application, however, came too late to be generally used; and the forms
already introduced continued to prevail.At the same time it is evident
that a Persepolitan base for an Ionic and even for a Corinthian column
would be amongst the greatest improvements that could now be introduced,
especially for internal architecture.The true Roman order, however, was not any of these columnar ordinances
we have been enumerating, but an arrangement of two pillars placed at a
distance from one another nearly equal to their own height, and having a
very long entablature, which in consequence required to be supported in
the centre by an arch springing from piers.This, as will be seen from
the annexed woodcut, was in fact merely a screen of Grecian architecture
placed in front of a construction of Etruscan design.Though not without
a certain richness of effect, still, as used by the Romans, these two
systems remain too distinctly dissimilar for the result to be pleasing,
and their use necessitated certain supplemental arrangements by no means
agreeable.In the first place, the columns had to be mounted on
pedestals, or otherwise an entablature proportional to their size would
have been too heavy and too important for a thing so useless and so
avowedly a mere ornament.A projecting keystone was also introduced into
the arch.This was unobjectionable in itself, but when projecting so far
as to do the duty of an intermediate capital, it overpowered the arch
without being equal to the work required of it.The Romans used these arcades with all the 3 orders, frequently one over
the other, and tried various expedients to harmonise the construction
with the ornamentation, but without much effect.They seem always to
have felt the discordance as a blemish, and at last got rid of it, but
whether they did so in the best way is not quite clear.The most obvious
mode of effecting this would no doubt have been by omitting the pillars
altogether, bending the architrave, as is usually done, round the arch,
and then inserting the frieze and cornices into the wall, using them as
a string-course.A slight degree of practice would soon have enabled
them—by panelling the pier, cutting off its angles, or some such
expedient—to have obtained the degree of lightness or of ornament they
required, and so really to have invented a new order.This, however, was not the course that the Romans pursued.What they did
was to remove the pier altogether, and to substitute for it the pillar
taken down from its pedestal.This of course was not effected at once,
but was the result of many trials and expedients.One of the earliest of
these is observed in the Ionic Temple of Concord before alluded to, in
which a concealed arch is thrown from the head of each pillar, but above
the entablature, so as to take the whole weight of the superstructure
from off the cornice between the pillars.When once this was done it was
perceived that so deep an entablature was no longer required, and that
it might be either wholly omitted, as was sometimes done in the centre
intercolumniation, or very much reduced.There is an old temple at
Talavera in Spain, which is a good example of the former expedient; and
the Roman gateway at Damascus is a remarkable instance of the latter.There the architrave, frieze and cornice are carried across in the form
of an arch from pier to pier, thus constituting a new feature in
architectural design.View in Courtyard of Palace at Spalato]

In Diocletian’s reign we find all these changes already introduced into
domestic architecture, as shown in Woodcut No.185, representing the
great court of his palace at Spalato, where, at one end, the entablature
is bent into the form of an arch over the central intercolumniation,
while on each side of the court the arches spring directly from the
capitals of the columns.Had the Romans at this period been more desirous to improve their
external architecture, there is little doubt that they would have
adopted the expedient of omitting the entire entablature: but at this
time almost all their efforts were devoted to internal improvement, and
not unfrequently at the expense of the exterior.Indeed the whole
history of Roman art, from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine,
is a transition from the external architecture of the Greeks to the
internal embellishment of the Christians.At first we see the cells of
the temple gradually enlarged at the expense of the peristyle, and
finally, in some instances, entirely overpowering them.Their basilicas
and halls become more important than their porticoes, and the exterior
is in almost every instance sacrificed to internal arrangements.For an
interior, an arch resting on a circular column is obviously far more
appropriate than one resting on a pier.Externally, on the contrary, the
square pier is most suitable, because a pillar cannot support a wall of
sufficient thickness.This defect was not remedied until the Gothic
architects devised the plan of coupling two or more pillars together;
but this point had not been reached at the time when with the fall of
Rome all progress in art was effectually checked for a time.There is perhaps nothing that strikes the inquirer into the
architectural history of Rome more than the extreme insignificance of
her temples, as compared with the other buildings of the imperial city
and with some contemporary temples found in the provinces.The only
temple which remains at all worthy of such a capital is the Pantheon.All others are now mere fragments, from which we can with difficulty
restore even the plans of the buildings, far less judge of their effect.We have now no means of forming an opinion of the great national temple
of the Capitoline Jove, no trace of it, nor any intelligible
description, having been preserved to the present time.Its having been
of Etruscan origin, and retaining its original form to the latest day,
would lead us to suppose that the temple itself was small, and that its
magnificence, if any, was confined to the enclosure and to the
substructure, which may have been immense.Of the Augustan age we have nothing but the remains of three temples,
each consisting of only three columns; and the excavations that have
been made around them have not sufficed to make even their plans
tolerably clear.The most remarkable was that of Jupiter Stator in the Forum, the
beautiful details of which have been already alluded to and described.It was raised on a stylobate 22 ft.in height, the extreme width of which was 98 ft., and this corresponds
as closely as possible with 100 Roman ft.The height of the pillars was 48 ft., and
that of the entablature 12 ft.[165] It is probable that the whole
height to the apex of the pediment was nearly equal to the extreme
width, and that it was designed to be so.The pillars certainly extended on both flanks, and the temple is
generally restored as peristylar, but apparently without any authority.From the analogy of the other temples it seems more probable that there
were not more than eight or ten pillars on each side, and that the apse
of the cella formed the termination opposite the portico.The temple nearest to this in situation and style is that of Jupiter
Tonans.[166] The order in this instance is of slightly inferior
dimensions to that of the temple just described, and of very inferior
execution.The temple, too, was very much smaller, having only six
columns in front, and from its situation it could not well have had more
than that number on the flanks, so that its extreme dimensions were
probably about 70 ft.The third is the Temple of Mars Ultor, of which a plan is annexed; for
though now as completely decayed as the other two, in the time of Ant.Sabacco and Palladio there seem to have been sufficient remains to
justify an attempt at restoration.As will be seen, it is nearly square
in plan (112 ft.The cella is here a much more important part
than is usual in Greek temples, and terminates in an apse, which
afterwards became characteristic of all places of worship.Behind the
cella, and on each side, was a lofty screen of walls and arches, part of
which still remain, and form quite a new adjunct, unlike anything
hitherto met with attached to any temple now known.(From Cresy’s ‘Rome.’) Scale
100 ft.The next class of temples, called pseudo-peripteral (or those in which
the cella occupies the whole of the after part), are generally more
modern, certainly more completely Roman, than these last.One of the
best specimens at Rome is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, a small
building measuring 72 ft.There is also a very elegant little
Ionic temple of this class called that of Fortuna Virilis; while the
Ionic Temple of Concord, built by Vespasian, and above alluded to,
appears also to have been of this class.So was the temple in the forum
at Pompeii; but the finest specimen now remaining to us is the so-called
Maison Carrée at Nîmes, which is indeed one of the most elegant temples
of the Roman world, owing probably a great deal of its beauty to the
taste of the Grecian colonists long settled in its neighbourhood.It is
hexastyle, with 11 columns in the flanks, 3 of which stand free, and
belong to the portico; the remaining 8 are attached to the walls of the
cella.by 85; but such is the beauty of
its proportions and the elegance of its details that it strikes every
beholder with admiration.Plan of Maison Carrée at Nîmes.The date of this temple has not been satisfactorily ascertained.From
the nail-holes of the inscription on the frieze it has been attempted to
make out the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and there is nothing in
the style of its architecture to contradict this hypothesis.Even if the
buildings in the capital were such as to render this date ambiguous, it
would scarcely be safe to apply any argument derived from them to a
provincial example erected in the midst of a Grecian colony.But for
their evidence we might almost be inclined to fancy its style
represented the age of Trajan.The temple of Diana in the same city is another edifice of singular
beauty of detail, and interesting from the peculiarity of its plan.Exclusive of the portico it is nearly square, 70 ft.by 65, and consists
of a cella which is covered with a stone ribbed vault, the thrust of
which is counteracted by smaller vaults thrown across two side passages
or aisles which are, however, not thrown open to the cella.The columns
in the cella are detached from the wall, which is singularly interesting
as the origin of much which we find afterwards in Gothic work.(A
somewhat similar arrangement is found in the small temple at Baalbec
(Woodcut No.197) where, however, the peristyle occupies the position
and serves the same purpose as the aisles at Nîmes, viz., to resist the
thrust of the vault over the cella.)Plan of Temple of Diana at Nîmes.Throughout this building the details of the architecture are unsurpassed
for variety and elegance by anything found in the metropolis, and are
applied here with a freedom and elegance bespeaking the presence of a
Grecian mind even in this remote corner of the Empire.This was supported by four slender
columns of singularly elegant design, but placed so widely apart that
they could not have carried a stone entablature.It is difficult to
guess what could have been the form of the wooden ones; but a mortice
which still exists in the walls of the temple shows that it must have
been eight or ten feet deep, and therefore probably of Etruscan form
(Woodcut No.167); though it may have assumed a circular arched form
between the pillars.[167]

[Illustration: 189.View of the Interior of the Temple of Diana at
Nîmes.Another peculiarity is, that the light was introduced over the portico
by a great semicircular window, as is done in the Buddhist caves in
India; which, so far as I know, is the most perfect mode of lighting the
interior of a temple which has yet been discovered.Not far from the Colosseum, in the direction of the Forum, are still to
be seen the remains of a great double temple built by the Emperor
Hadrian, and dedicated to Venus and Rome, and consisting of the ruins of
its two cells, each about 70 ft.square, covered with tunnel-vaults, and
placed back to back, so that their apses touch one another.long by 330 wide; and it is generally supposed
that on the edge of this once stood 56 great columns, 65 ft.in height,
thus moulding the whole into one great peripteral temple.Some fragments
of such pillars are said to be found in the neighbourhood, but not one
is now erect,—not even a base is in its place,—nor can any of its
columns be traced to any other buildings.This part, therefore, of the
arrangement is very problematical, and I should be rather inclined to
restore it, as Palladio and the older architects have done, with a
corridor of ten small columns in front of each of the cells.If we could
assume the plan of this temple to have been really peripteral, as
supposed, it must have been a building worthy of the imperial city and
of the magnificence of the emperor to whom its erection is ascribed.More perfect and more interesting than any of these is the Pantheon,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest temples of the ancient world.Externally its effect is very much destroyed by its two parts, the
circular and the rectangular, being so dissimilar in style and so
incongruously joined together.The portico especially, in itself the
finest which Rome exhibits, is very much injured by being prefixed to a
mass which overpowers it and does not harmonise with any of its lines.The pitch, too, of its pediment is perhaps somewhat too high, but,
notwithstanding all this, its sixteen columns, the shaft of each
composed of a single block, and the simple grandeur of the details,
render it perhaps the most satisfactory example of its class.The pillars are arranged in the Etruscan fashion, as they were
originally disposed in front of three-celled temples.As they now stand,
however, they are added unsymmetrically to a rotunda, and in so clumsy a
fashion that the two are certainly not part of the same design and do
not belong to the same age.Either it was that the portico was added to
the pre-existing rotunda, or that the rotunda is long subsequent to the
portico.Unfortunately the two inscriptions on the portico hardly help
to a solution of the difficulty.The principal one states that it was
built by M. Agrippa, but the “it” may refer to the rotunda only, and may
have been put there by those who in the time of Aurelius[168] repaired
the temple which had “fallen into decay from age.” This hardly could,
under any circumstances, be predicated of the rotunda, which shows no
sign of decay during the last seventeen centuries of ill-treatment and
neglect, and may last for as many more without injury to its stability,
but might be said of a portico which, if of wood, as Etruscan porticoes
usually were, may easily in 200 years have required repairs and
rebuilding.From a more careful examination on the spot, I am convinced
that the portico was added at some subsequent period to the rotunda.If
by Agrippa, then the dome must belong to Republican times; if by Severus
it may have been, as is generally supposed, the hall of the Baths of
Agrippa.[169] Altogether I know of no building whose date and
arrangements are so singular and so exceptional as this.Though it is,
and always must have been, one of the most prominent buildings in Rome,
and most important from its size and design, I know of no other building
in Rome whose date or original destination it is so difficult to
determine.Half Elevation, half Section, of the Pantheon at
Rome.Internally perhaps the greatest defect of the building is a want of
height in the perpendicular part, which the dome appears to overpower
and crush.This mistake is aggravated by the lower part being cut up
into two storeys, an attic being placed over the lower order.The former
defect may have arisen from the architect wishing to keep the walls in
some proportion to the portico.The latter is a peculiarity of the age
in which I suppose this temple to have been remodelled, when two or more
storeys seem to have become indispensable requisites of architectural
design.We must ascribe also to the practice of the age the method of
cutting through the entablature by the arches of the great niches, as
shown in the sectional part of the last woodcut.It has already been
pointed out that this was becoming a characteristic of the style at the
time when the circular part of this temple was arranged as it at present
appears.Notwithstanding these defects and many others of detail that might be
mentioned, there is a grandeur and a simplicity in the proportions of
this great temple that render it still one of the very finest and most
sublime interiors in the world, and the dimensions of its dome, 145 ft.span by 147 in height, have not yet been surpassed by any
subsequent erection.Though it is deprived of its bronze covering[170]
and of the greater part of those ornaments on which it mainly depended
for effect, and though these have been replaced by tawdry and
incongruous modernisms, still nothing can destroy the effect of a design
so vast and of a form so simply grand.It possesses moreover one other
element of architectural sublimity in having a single window, and that
placed high up in the building.I know of no other temples which possess
this feature except the great rock-cut Buddhist basilicas of India.In
them the light is introduced even more artistically than here; but,
nevertheless, that one great eye opening upon heaven is by far the
noblest conception for lighting a building to be found in Europe.Besides this great rotunda there are two other circular temples in or
near Rome.The one at Tivoli, shown in plan and elevation in the annexed
woodcuts (Nos.192 and 193), has long been known and admired; the other,
near the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima, has a cell surrounded by twenty
Corinthian columns of singularly slender proportions.Both these
probably stand on Etruscan sites; they certainly are Etruscan in form,
and are very likely sacred to Pelasgic deities, either Vesta or Cybele.Restored Elevation of Temple at Tivoli.Both in dimensions and design they form a perfect contrast to the
Pantheon, as might be expected from their both belonging to the Augustan
age of art: consequently the cella is small, its interior is
unornamented, and all the art and expense is lavished on the external
features, especially on the peristyle; showing more strongly than even
the rectangular temple the still remaining predominance of Grecian
taste, which was gradually dying out during the whole period of the
Empire.It is to be regretted that the exact dates of both these temples are
unknown, for, as that at Tivoli shows the stoutest example of a
Corinthian column known and that in Rome the slenderest, it might lead
to some important deductions if we could be certain which was the older
of the two.It may be, however, that this difference of style has no
connection with the relative age of the two buildings, but that it is
merely an instance of the good taste of the age to which they belong.The Roman example, being placed in a low and flat situation, required
all the height that could be given it; that at Tivoli, being placed on
the edge of a rock, required as much solidity as the order would admit
of to prevent its looking poor and insecure.A Gothic or a Greek
architect would certainly have made this distinction.One more step towards the modern style of round temples was taken before
the fall of the Western Empire, in the temple which Diocletian built in
his palace at Spalato.Internally the temple is circular, 28 ft.in
diameter, and the height of the perpendicular part to the springing of
the dome is about equal to its width.This is a much more pleasing
proportion than we find in the Pantheon; perhaps the very best that has
yet been employed.Externally the building is an octagon, surrounded by
a low dwarf peristyle, very unlike that employed in the older examples.This angularity is certainly a great improvement, giving expression and
character to the building, and affording flat faces for the entrances or
porches; but the peristyle is too low, and mars the dignity of the
whole.[171]

[Illustration: 194.Plan and Elevation of Temple in Diocletian’s Palace
at Spalato.To us its principal interest consists in its being so extremely similar
to the Christian baptisteries which were erected in the following
centuries, and which were copies, but very slightly altered, from
buildings of this class.Even assuming that Hadrian completed the great Temple of Venus at Rome
in the manner generally supposed, it must have been very far surpassed
by the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, which, though
probably not entirely erected, was certainly finished, by that Emperor.It was octastyle in front,[172] with a double range of 20 columns on
each flank so that it could not well have had less than 106 columns, all
about 58 ft.in height, and of the most elegant Corinthian order,
presenting altogether a group of far greater magnificence than any other
temple we are acquainted with of its class in the ancient world.Its
lineal dimensions also, as may be seen from the plan (Woodcut No.195),
were only rivalled by the two great Sicilian temples at Selinus and
Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.wide by 354 in
length, or nearly the same dimensions as the great Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac, from which, however, it differs most materially, that being a
beautiful example of an interior, this depending for all its
magnificence on the external arrangement of its columns.Penrose’s
discoveries in 1884 show that there was an opisthodomus at the rear and
a vestibule or court in front of the cella which may have been hypæthral
so as to admit light into the interior.This arrangement became so
common in the early Christian world that there must have been some
precedent for it; which, in addition to other reasons,[173] strongly
inclines me to believe that the arrangement shown in the plan is
correct.Ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]Plan of Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]The temples of Palmyra and Kangovar have been already mentioned in
speaking of that of Jerusalem, to which class they seem to belong in
their general arrangements, though their details are borrowed from Roman
architecture.This, however, is not the case with the temples at
Baalbec, which taken together and with their accompaniments, form the
most magnificent temple group now left to us of their class and age.The
great temple, if completed (which, however, probably it never was),
would have been about 160 ft.by 290, and therefore, as a Corinthian
temple, only inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.Only nine
of its colossal columns are now standing, but the bases of most of the
others are _in situ_.Scarcely less magnificent than the temple itself
was the court in which it stood, above 380 ft.square, and surrounded on
three sides by recessed porticoes of most exuberant richness, though in
perhaps rather questionable taste.In front of this was a hexagonal
court of very great beauty, with a noble portico of 12 Corinthian
columns, with two square blocks of masonry at each end.The whole extent
of the portico is 260 ft., and of its kind it is perhaps unrivalled,
certainly among the buildings of so late a date as the period to which
it belongs.Elevation of Small Temple at Baalbec.The other, or smaller temple, stands close to the larger.Its
dimensions, to the usual scale, are shown in the plan (Woodcut No.It is larger than any of the Roman peripteral temples, being 117 ft.by
227 ft., or rather exceeding the dimensions of the Parthenon at Athens,
and its portico is both wider and higher than that of the Pantheon at
Rome.Had this portico been applied to that building, the <DW72> of its
pediment would have coincided exactly with that of the upper sloping
cornice, and would have been the greatest possible improvement to that
edifice.As it is, it certainly is the best proportioned and the most
graceful Roman portico of the first class that remains to us in a state
of sufficient completeness to allow us to judge of its effect.The interior of the cella was richly ornamented with niches and
pilasters, and covered with a ribbed and coffered vault, remarkable,
like every part of this edifice, rather for the profusion than for the
good taste of its ornaments.One of the principal peculiarities of this group of buildings is the
immense size of some of the stones used in the substructure of the great
temple: three of these average about 63 ft.A fourth, of similar dimensions, is lying
in the quarry, which it is calculated must weigh alone more than 1100
tons in its rough state, or nearly as much as one of the tubes of the
Britannia Bridge.It is not easy to see why such masses were employed.If they had been used as foundation stones their use would have been
apparent, but they are placed over several courses of smaller stones,
about half-way up the terrace wall, as mere binding stones, apparently
for show.It is true that in many places in the Bible and in Josephus
nothing is so much insisted upon as the immense size of the stones used
in the building of the Temple and the walls of Jerusalem, the bulk of
the materials used appearing to have been thought a matter of far more
importance than the architecture.It probably was some such feeling as
this which led to their employment here, though, had these huge stones
been set upright, as the Egyptians would have placed them, we might more
easily have understood why so great an expense should have been incurred
on their account.As it is, there seems no reason for doubting their
being of the same age as the temples they support, though their use is
certainly exceptional in Roman temples of this class.BASILICAS, THEATRES, AND BATHS.Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius—Provincial basilicas—Theatre at
  Orange—Colosseum—Provincial amphitheatres—Baths of Diocletian.We have already seen that in size and magnificence the temples of Rome
were among the least remarkable of her public buildings.It may be
doubted whether in any respect, in the eyes of the Romans themselves,
the temples were as important and venerable as the basilicas.The people
cared for government and justice more than for religion, and
consequently paid more attention to the affairs of the basilicas than to
those of the temples.Our means for the restoration of this class of
buildings are now but small, owing to their slight construction in the
first instance, and to their materials having been so suitable for the
building of Christian basilicas as to have been extensively used for
that purpose.It happens, however, that the remains which we do possess
comprise what we know to be the ruins of the two most splendid buildings
of this class in Rome, and these are sufficiently complete to enable us
to restore their plans with considerable confidence.It is also
fortunate that one of these, the Ulpian or Trajan’s basilica, is the
typical specimen of those with wooden roofs; the other, that of
Maxentius, commonly called the Temple of Peace, is the noblest of the
vaulted class.Plan of Trajan’s Basilica at Rome.The part shaded darker is all that is uncovered.
]Restored Section of Trajan’s Basilica.The rectangular part of Trajan’s basilica was 180 ft.in width and a
little more than twice that in length, but, neither end having yet been
excavated, its exact longitudinal measurement has not been ascertained.It was divided into five aisles by four rows of columns, each about 35
ft.wide, and the side-aisles 23 ft.The centre was covered by a wooden roof of semicircular
form,[174] covered apparently with bronze plates richly ornamented and
gilt.Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was
supported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang
the arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was
thus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,
though not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was
raised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre
of this platform was the raised seat of the quæstor or other magistrate
who presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the
assessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front
of the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before
commencing any important public business.[175]

Externally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It
was entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and
section) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on
either side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height
as those used internally.These supported statues, or rather, to judge
from the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set
off, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as
this was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to
have prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have
been very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the
structure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the
exception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class
of buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took
the place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always
suggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a
mere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the façade.The interior
of the basilica was, however, the important element to which the
exterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design
which we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,
which were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose
conformation had become sacred from the traditions of past ages.Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.Transverse Section of Basilica of Maxentius.The basilica of Maxentius, which was probably not entirely finished till
the reign of Constantine, was rather broader than that of Trajan, being
195 ft.between the walls, but it was 100 ft.The
central aisle was very nearly of the same width, being 83 ft.There was, however, a vast difference
in the construction of the two; so much so, that we are startled to see
how rapid the progress had been during the interval, of less than two
centuries, that had elapsed between the construction of the two
basilicas.Pillar of Maxentian Basilica.(From an old print
quoted by Letarouilly.)]In this building no pillars were used with the exception of eight great
columns in front of the piers, employed merely as ornaments, or as
vaulting shafts were in Gothic cathedrals, to support in appearance,
though not in construction, the springing of the vaults.[176] The
side-aisles were roofed by three great arches, each 74 ft.in span, and
the centre by an immense intersecting vault in three compartments.The
form of these will be understood from the annexed sections (Woodcuts
Nos.202 and 203), one taken longitudinally, the other across the
building.As will be seen from them, all the thrusts are collected to a
point and a buttress placed there to receive them: indeed almost all the
peculiarities afterwards found in Gothic vaults are here employed on a
far grander and more gigantic scale than the Gothic architects ever
attempted; but at the same time it must be allowed that the latter, with
smaller dimensions, often contrived by a more artistic treatment of
their materials to obtain as grand an effect and far more actual beauty
than ever were attained in the great transitional halls of the Romans.The largeness of the parts of the Roman buildings was indeed their
principal defect, as in consequence of this they must all have appeared
smaller than they really were, whereas in all Gothic cathedrals the
repetition and smallness of the component parts has the effect of
magnifying their real dimensions.The roofs of these halls had one peculiarity which it would have been
well if the mediæval architects had copied, inasmuch as they were all,
or at least might have been, honestly used as roofs without any
necessity for their being covered with others of wood, as all Gothic
vaults unfortunately were.It is true this is perhaps one of the causes
of their destruction, for, being only overlaid with cement, the rain
wore away the surface, as must inevitably be the case with any
composition of the sort exposed horizontally to the weather, and that
being gone, the moisture soon penetrated through the crevices of the
masonry, destroying the stability of the vault.Still, some of these in
Rome have resisted for fifteen centuries, after the removal of any
covering they ever might have had, all the accidents of climate and
decay, while there is not a Gothic vault of half their dimensions that
would stand for a century after the removal of its wooden protection.The construction of a vault capable of resisting the destructive effects
of exposure to the atmosphere still remains a problem for modern
architects to solve.Until this is accomplished we must regard roofs
entirely of honest wood as preferable to the deceptive stone ceilings
which were such favourites in the Middle Ages.Plan of the Basilica at Trèves.Internal View of the Basilica at Trèves.]The provincial basilicas of the Roman Empire have nearly all perished,
probably from their having been converted, first into churches, for
which they were so admirably adapted, and then rebuilt to suit the
exigencies and taste of subsequent ages.One example, however, still
exists in Trèves of sufficient completeness to give a good idea of what
such structures were.As will be seen by the annexed plan, it consists
of a great hall, 85 ft.in width internally, and rather more than twice
that dimension in length.in height and
pierced with two rows of windows; but whether they were originally
separated by a gallery or not is now by no means clear.At one end was
the apse, rather more than a semicircle of 60 ft.The floor
of the apse was raised considerably above that of the body of the
building, and was no doubt adorned by a hemicycle of seats raised on
steps, with a throne in the centre for the judge.The building has been
used for so many purposes since the time of the Romans, and has been so
much altered, that it is not easy now to speak with certainty of any of
its minor arrangements.Its internal and external appearance, as it
stood before the recent restoration, are well expressed in the annexed
woodcuts; and though ruined, it was the most complete example of a Roman
basilica to be found anywhere out of the capital.A building of this
description has been found at Pompeii, which may be considered a fair
example of a provincial basilica of the second class.Its plan is
perfectly preserved, as shown in Woodcut No.The most striking
difference existing between it and those previously described is the
square termination instead of the circular apse.It must, however, be
observed that Pompeii was situated nearer to Magna Græcia than to Rome,
and was indeed far more a Greek than a Roman city.Very slight traces of
any Etruscan designs have been discovered there, and scarcely any
buildings of the circular form so much in vogue in the capital.Though
the ground-plan of this basilica remains perfect, the upper parts are
entirely destroyed, and we do not even know for certain whether the
central portion was roofed or not.[177]

[Illustration: 207.External View of the Basilica at Trèves.]There is a small square building at Otricoli, which is generally
supposed to be a basilica, but its object as well as its age is so
uncertain that nothing need be said of it here.In the works of
Vitruvius, too, there is a description of one built by him at Fano, the
restoration of which has afforded employment for the ingenuity of the
admirers of that worst of architects.Even taking it as restored by
those most desirous of making the best of it, it is difficult to
understand how anything so bad could have been erected in such an age.It is extremely difficult to trace the origin of these basilicas, owing
principally to the loss of all the earlier examples.Their name is
Greek, and they may probably be considered as derived from the Grecian
Lesche, or perhaps as amplifications of the cellæ of Greek temples,
appropriated to the purposes of justice rather than of religion; but
till we know more of their earlier form and origin, it is useless
speculating on this point.The greatest interest to us, arises rather
from the use to which their plan was afterwards applied, than from the
source from which they themselves sprang.All the larger Christian
churches in the early times were copies, more or less exact, of the
basilicas of which that of Trajan is an example.The abundance of
pillars, suitable to such an erection, that were found everywhere in
Rome, rendered their construction easy and cheap; and the wooden roof
with which they were covered was also as simple and as inexpensive a
covering as could well be designed.The very uses of the Christian
basilicas at first were by no means dissimilar to those of their heathen
originals, as they were in reality the assembly halls of the early
Christian republic, before they became liturgical churches of the
Catholic hierarchy.The more expensive construction of the bold vaults of the Maxentian
basilica went far beyond the means of the early Church, established in a
declining and abandoned capital, and this form therefore remained
dormant for seven or eight centuries before it was revived by the
mediæval architects on an infinitely smaller scale, but adorned with a
degree of appropriateness and taste to which the Romans were strangers.It was then used with a completeness and unity which entitle it to be
considered as an entirely new style of architecture.The theatre was by no means so essential a part of the economy of a
Roman city as it was of a Grecian one.With the latter it was quite as
indispensable as the temple; and in the semi-Greek city of Herculaneum
there was one, and in Pompeii two, on a scale quite equal to those of
Greece when compared with the importance of the town itself.In the
capital there appears only to have been one, that of Marcellus,[178]
built during the reign of Augustus.It it is very questionable whether
what we now see—especially the outer arcades—belong to that age, or
whether the theatre may not have been rebuilt and these arcades added at
some later period.It is so completely built over by modern houses, and
so ruined, that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any satisfactory
opinion regarding it.Its dimensions were worthy of the capital, the
audience part being a semicircle of 410 ft.in diameter, and the scena
being of great extent in proportion to the other part, which is a
characteristic of all Roman theatres, as compared with Grecian edifices
of this class.One of the most striking Roman provincial theatres is that of Orange, in
the south of France.Perhaps it owes its existence, or at all events its
splendour, to the substratum of Grecian colonists that preceded the
Romans in that country.in diameter, but much
ruined, in consequence of the Princes of Orange having used this part as
a bastion in some fortification they were constructing.It shows well the increased
extent and complication of arrangements required for the theatrical
representations of the age in which it was constructed, being a
considerable advance towards the more modern idea of a play, as
distinguished from the stately semi-religious spectacle in which the
Greeks delighted.The noblest part of the building is the great wall at
the back, an immense mass of masonry 340 ft.in
height, without a single opening above the basement, and no ornament
except a range of blank arches, about midway between the basement and
the top, and a few projecting corbels to receive the footings of the
masts that supported the velarium.Nowhere does the architecture of the
Romans shine so much as when their gigantic buildings are left to tell
their own tale by the imposing grandeur of their masses.Whenever
ornament is attempted, their bad taste comes out.The size of their
edifices, and the solidity of their construction, were only surpassed by
the Egyptians, and not always by them; and when, as here, the mass of
material heaped up stands unadorned in all its native grandeur,
criticism is disarmed, and the spectator stands awe-struck at its
majesty, and turns away convinced that truly “there were giants in those
days.” This is not, it is true, the most intellectual way of obtaining
architectural effect, but it has the advantage of being the easiest, the
most certain to secure the desired result, and at the same time the most
permanent.The deficiency of theatres erected by the Romans is far more than
compensated by the number and splendour of their amphitheatres, which,
with their baths, may be considered as the true types of Roman art,
although it is possible that they derived this class of public buildings
from the Etruscans.At Sutrium there is a very noble one cut out of the
tufa rock,[179] which was no doubt used by that people for festal
representations long before Rome attempted anything of the kind.It is
uncertain whether gladiatorial fights or combats of wild beasts formed
any part of the amusements of the arena in those days, though boxing,
wrestling, and contests of that description certainly did; but whether
the Etruscans actually proceeded to the shedding of blood and to
slaughter is more than doubtful.Even in the remotest parts of Britain, in Germany and Gaul, wherever we
find a Roman settlement, we find the traces of their amphitheatres.Their soldiery, it seems, could not exist without the enjoyment of
seeing men engaged in doubtful and mortal combats—either killing one
another, or torn to pieces by wild beasts.It is not to be wondered at
that a people who delighted so much in the bloody scenes of the arena
should feel but very little pleasure in the mimic sorrows and tame
humour of the stage.The brutal exhibition of the amphitheatre fitted
them, it is true, to be a nation of conquerors, and gave them the empire
of the world, but it brought with it feelings singularly inimical to all
the softer arts, and was perhaps the great cause of their ultimate
debasement.Elevation and Section of part of the Flavian
Amphitheatre at Rome.Quarter-plan of the Seats and quarter-plan of the
Basement of the Flavian Amphitheatre.As might be expected, the largest and most splendid of these buildings
is that which adorns the capital; and of all the ruins which Rome
contains, none have excited such universal admiration as the Flavian
Amphitheatre.Poets, painters, rhapsodists, have exhausted all the
resources of their arts in the attempt to convey to others the
overpowering impression this building produces on their own minds.With
the single exception, perhaps, of the Hall at Karnac, no ruin has met
with such universal admiration as this.Its association with the ancient
mistress of the world, its destruction, and the half-prophetic destiny
ascribed to it, all contribute to this.In spite of our better judgment
we are forced to confess that

                 “The gladiators’ bloody circus stands
                 A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,”

and worthy of all or nearly all the admiration of which it has been the
object.Its interior is almost wholly devoid of ornament, or anything
that can be called architecture—a vast inverted pyramid.The exterior
does not possess one detail which is not open to criticism, and indeed
to positive blame.Notwithstanding all this, its magnitude, its form,
and its associations, all combine to produce an effect against which the
critic struggles in vain.Still, all must admit that the pillars and
their entablature are useless and are added incongruously, and that the
upper storey, not being arched like the lower, but solid, and with ugly
pilasters, is a painful blemish.This last defect is so striking that,
in spite of the somewhat dubious evidence of medals, I should feel
inclined to suspect that it was a subsequent addition, and meant wholly
for the purpose of supporting and working the great velarium or awning
that covered the arena during the representation, which may not have
been attempted when the amphitheatre was first erected.Be this as it may, it certainly now very much mars the effect of the
building.The lower storeys are of bad design, but this is worse.But
notwithstanding these defects, there is no building of Rome where the
principle of reduplication of parts, of which the Gothic architects
afterwards made so much use, is carried to so great an extent as in
this.The Colosseum is principally indebted to this feature for the
effect which it produces.Had it, for instance, been designed with only
one storey of the height of the four now existing, and every arch had
consequently been as wide as the present four, the building would have
scarcely appeared half the size it is now seen to be.For all this,
however, when close under it, and comparing it with moving figures and
other objects, we could scarcely eventually fail to realise its
wonderful dimensions.In that case, a true sense of the vast size of the
building would have had to be acquired, as is the case with the façade
of St.Now it forces itself on the mind at the first glance.It
is the repetition of arch beyond arch and storey over storey that leads
the mind on, and gives to this amphitheatre its imposing grandeur, which
all acknowledge, though few give themselves the trouble to inquire how
this effect is produced.Fortunately, too, though the face of the building is much cut up by the
order, the entablatures are unbroken throughout, and cross the building
in long vanishing lines of the most graceful curvatures.The oval, also,
is certainly more favourable for effect than a circular form would be.A
building of this shape may perhaps look smaller than it really is to a
person standing exactly opposite either end; but in all other positions
the flatter side gives a variety and an appearance of size, which the
monotonous equality of a circle would never produce.The length of the building, measured over all along its greatest
diameter, is 620 ft., its breadth 513, or nearly in the ratio of 6 to 5,
which may be taken as the general proportion of these buildings, the
variations from it being slight, and apparently either mistakes in
setting out the work in ancient times, or in measuring it in modern
days, rather than an intentional deviation.The height of the three
lower storeys, or of what I believe to have been the original building,
is 120 ft.; the total height as it now stands is 157 ft.The whole area of
the building has been calculated to contain 250,000 square feet, of
which the arena contains 40,000; then deducting 10,000 for the external
wall, 200,000 square feet will remain available for the audience.If we
divide this by 5,[180] which is the number of square feet it has been
found necessary to allow for each spectator in modern places of
amusement, room will be afforded for 40,000 spectators; at 4 feet, which
is a possible quantity, with continuous seats and the scant drapery of
the Romans, the amphitheatre might contain 50,000 spectators at one
time.The area of the supports has also been calculated at about 40,000 square
feet, or about one-sixth of the whole area; which for an unroofed
edifice of this sort[181] is more than sufficient, though the excess
accounts for the stability of the building.Next in extent to this great metropolitan amphitheatre was that of
Capua; its dimensions were 558 ft.It had three storeys, designed similarly to those of the Colosseum, but
all of the Doric order, and used with more purity than in the Roman
example.Next in age, though not in size, is that at Nîmes, 430 ft.by 378, and
72 in height, in two storeys.Both these storeys are more profusely and
more elegantly ornamented with pillars than those of either of the
amphitheatres mentioned above.The entablature is however broken over
each column, and pediments are introduced on each front.All these
arrangements, though showing more care in design and sufficient elegance
in detail, make this building very inferior in grandeur to the two
earlier edifices, whose simplicity of outline makes up, to a great
extent, for their faults of detail.A more beautiful example than this is that at Verona.high, in three storeys beautifully
proportioned.Here the order almost entirely disappears to make way for
rustication, showing that it must be considerably more modern than
either of the three examples above quoted, though hardly so late as the
time of Maximianus, to whom it is frequently ascribed.[182] The arena of
this amphitheatre is very nearly perfect, owing to the care taken of it
during the Middle Ages, when it was often used for tournaments and other
spectacles; but of its outer architectural enclosure only four bays
remain, sufficient to enable an architect to restore the whole, but not
to allow of its effect being compared with that of more entire examples.The amphitheatre at Pola, which is of about the same age as that of
Verona, and certainly belonging to the last days of the Western Empire,
presents in its ruin a curious contrast to the other.That at Verona has
a perfect arena and only a fragment of its exterior decoration, while
the exterior of Pola is perfect, but not a trace remains of its arena,
or of the seats that surrounded it.This is probably owing to their
having been of wood, and consequently having either decayed or been
burnt.Like that at Verona, it presents all the features of the last
stage of transition; the order is still seen, or rather is everywhere
suggested, but so concealed and kept subordinate that it does not at all
interfere with the general effect.But for these faint traces we should
possess in this amphitheatre one specimen entirely emancipated from
incongruous Grecian forms, but, as before remarked, Rome perished when
just on the threshold of the new style.Elevation of the Amphitheatre at Verona.The dimensions of the amphitheatre at Pola are very nearly the same as
of that at Nîmes, being 436 ft.It has, however, three storeys,
and thus its height is considerably greater, being 97 ft.Owing to the
inequality of the ground on which it is built, the lower storey shows
the peculiarity of a sub-basement, which is very pleasingly managed, and
appears to emancipate it more from conventional forms than is the case
with its contemporary at Verona.The third storey, or attic, is also
more pleasing than elsewhere, as it is avowedly designed for the support
of the masts of the velarium.The pilasters and all Greek forms are
omitted, and there is only a groove over every column of the middle
storey to receive the masts.There is also a curious sort of open
battlement on the top, evidently designed to facilitate the working of
the awning, though in what manner is not quite clear.There is still one
other peculiarity about the building, the curvature of its lines is
broken by four projecting wings, intended apparently to contain
staircases; in a building so light and open as this one is in its
present state there can be no doubt but that the projections give
expression and character to the outline, though such additions would go
far to spoil any of the greater examples above quoted.At Otricoli there is a small amphitheatre, 312 ft.by 230, in two
storeys, from which the order has entirely disappeared; it is therefore
possibly the most modern of its class, but the great flat pilasters that
replace the pillars are ungraceful and somewhat clumsy.Perhaps its
peculiarities ought rather to be looked on as provincialisms than as
genuine specimens of an advanced style.Still there is a pleasing
simplicity about it that on a larger scale would enable it to stand
comparison with some of its greater rivals.Besides these, which are the typical examples of the style, there are
the “Castrense” at Rome, nearly circular, and possessing all the faults
and none of the beauties of the Colosseum; one at Arles, very much
ruined; and a great number of provincial ones, not only in Italy and
Gaul, but in Germany and Britain.Almost all these were principally if
not wholly excavated from the earth, the part above-ground being the
mound formed by the excavation.If they ever possessed any external
decoration to justify their being treated as architectural objects, it
has disappeared, so that in the state at least in which we now find them
they do not belong to the ornamental class of works of which we are at
present treating.Next in splendour to the amphitheatres of the Romans were their great
thermal establishments: in size they were perhaps even more remarkable,
and their erection must certainly have been more costly.The
amphitheatre, however, has the great advantage in an architectural point
of view of being one object, one hall in short, whereas the baths were
composed of a great number of smaller parts, not perhaps very
successfully grouped together.They were wholly built of brick covered
with stucco (except perhaps the pillars), and have, therefore, now so
completely lost their architectural features that it is with difficulty
that even the most practised architect can restore them to anything like
their original appearance.In speaking of the great Thermæ of Imperial Rome, they must not be
confounded with such establishments as that of Pompeii for instance.The
latter was very similar to the baths now found in Cairo or
Constantinople, and indeed in most Eastern cities.These are mere
establishments for the convenience of bathers, consisting generally of
one or two small circular or octagonal halls, covered by domes, and one
or two others of an oblong shape, covered with vaults or wooden roofs,
used as reception-rooms, or places of repose after the bath.These have
never any external magnificence beyond an entrance-porch; and although
those at Pompeii are decorated internally with taste, and are well
worthy of study, their smallness of size and inferiority of design do
not admit of their being placed in the same category as those of the
capital, which are as characteristic of Rome as her amphitheatres, and
are such as could only exist in a capital where the bulk of the people
were able to live on the spoils of the conquered world rather than by
the honest gains of their own industry.Agrippa is said to have built baths immediately behind the Pantheon, and
Palladio and others have attempted restorations of them, assuming that
building to have been the entrance-hall.Nothing, however, can be more
unlikely than that, if he had first built the rotunda as a hall of his
baths, he should afterwards have added the portico, and converted it
from its secular use into a temple dedicated to all the gods.As before remarked, the two parts are certainly not of the same age.If
Agrippa built the rotunda as a part of his baths, the portico was added
a century and a half or two centuries afterwards, and it was then
converted into a temple.If Agrippa built the portico, he added it to a
building belonging to Republican times, which may always have been
dedicated to sacred purposes.As the evidence at present stands, I am
rather inclined to believe the first hypothesis most correctly
represents the facts of the case.[183]

Nero’s baths, too, are a mere heap of shapeless ruins, and those of
Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan in like manner are too much ruined for
their form, or even their dimensions, to be ascertained with anything
like correctness.Those of Titus are more perfect, but the very
discrepancies that exist between the different systems upon which their
restoration has been attempted show that enough does not remain to
enable the task to be accomplished in a satisfactory manner.They owe
their interest more to the beautiful fresco paintings that adorn their
vaults than to their architectural character.These paintings are
invaluable, as being the most extensive and perfect relics of the
painted decoration of the most flourishing period of the Empire, and
give a higher idea of Roman art than other indications would lead us to
expect.The baths of Constantine are also nearly wholly destroyed, so that out
of the great Thermæ two only, those of Diocletian and of Caracalla, now
remain sufficiently perfect to enable a restoration to be made of them
with anything like certainty.Baths of Caracalla, as restored by A.The great hall belonging to the baths of Diocletian is now the Church of
Sta.Maria degli Angeli, and has been considerably altered to suit the
changed circumstances of its use; while the modern buildings attached to
the church have so overlaid the older remains that it is not easy to
follow out the complete plan.This is of less consequence, as both in
dimensions and plan they are extremely similar to those of Caracalla,
which seem to have been among the most magnificent, as they certainly
are the best preserved, of these establishments.[184]

The general plan of the whole enclosure of the baths of Caracalla was a
square of about 1150 ft.each way, with a bold but graceful curvilinear
projection on two sides, containing porticoes, gymnasia, lecture-rooms,
and other halls for exercise of mind or body.In the rear were the
reservoirs to contain the requisite supply of water and below them the
hypocaust or furnace, by which it was warmed with a degree of scientific
skill we hardly give the Romans of that age credit for.Opposite to this
and facing the street was one great portico extending the whole length
of the building, into which opened a range of apartments, meant
apparently to be used as private baths, which extend also some way up
each side.In front of the hypocaust, facing the north-east, was a
semicircus or _theatridium_, 530 ft.long, where youths performed their
exercises or contended for prizes.These parts were, however, merely the accessories of the establishment
surrounding the garden, in which the principal building was placed.by 380, with a projection covered by a dome on
the south-western side, which was 167 ft.There were two small courts (A A) included in the
block, but nearly the whole of the rest appears to have been roofed
over.The modern building which approaches nearest in extent to this is
probably our Parliament Houses.in length, with
an average breadth of about 300, and, with Westminster Hall, cover as
nearly as may be the same area as the central block of these baths.But
there the comparison stops; there is no building of modern times on
anything like the same scale arranged wholly for architectural effect as
this one is, irrespective of any utilitarian purpose.On the other hand,
the whole of the walls being covered with stucco, and almost all the
architecture being expressed in that material, must have detracted
considerably from the monumental grandeur of the effect.Judging,
however, from what remains of the stucco ornament of the roof of the
Maxentian basilica (Woodcut No.202), it is wonderful to observe what
effects may be obtained with even this material in the hands of a people
who understand its employment.While stone and marble have perished, the
stucco of these vaults still remains, and is as impressive as any other
relic of ancient Rome.In the centre was a great hall (B), almost identical in dimensions with
the central aisle of the basilica of Maxentius already described, being
82 ft.wide by 170 in length, and roofed in the same manner by an
intersecting vault in three compartments, springing from eight great
pillars.This opened into a smaller apartment at each end, of
rectangular form, and then again into two other semicircular halls
forming a splendid suite 460 ft.This central room is
generally considered as the _tepidarium_, or warmed apartment, having
four warm baths opening out of it.On the north-east side was the
frigidarium, or cold water bath, a hall[185] of nearly the same
dimensions as the central Hall.Between this and the circular hall (D)
was the sudatorium or sweating-bath, with a hypocaust underneath, and
flue-tiles lining its walls.The laconicum or caldarium (D) is an
immense circular hall, 116 ft.in diameter, also heated by a hypocaust
underneath, and by flue tiles in the walls.This rotunda is said to be
of later date than Caracalla.There are four other rooms on this side,
which seem also to have been cold baths.None of these points have,
however, yet been satisfactorily settled, nor the uses of the smaller
subordinate rooms; every restorer giving them names according to his own
ideas.For our purpose it suffices to know that no groups of state
apartments in such dimensions, and wholly devoted to purposes of display
and recreation, were ever before or since grouped together under one
roof.The taste of many of the decorations would no doubt be faulty, and
the architecture shows those incongruities inseparable from its state of
transition; but such a collection of stately halls must have made up a
whole of greater splendour than we can easily realise from their bare
and weather-beaten ruins, or from anything else to which we can compare
them.Even allowing for their being almost wholly built of brick, and
for their being disfigured by the bad taste inseparable from everything
Roman, there is nothing in the world which for size and grandeur can
compare with these imperial places of recreation.[186]




                               CHAPTER V.

             TRIUMPHAL ARCHES, TOMBS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS.Arches at Rome; in France—Arch at Trèves—Columns of
  Victory—Tombs—Minerva Medica—Provincial tombs—Eastern tombs—Domestic
  architecture—Spalato—Pompeii—Bridges—Aqueducts.Triumphal Arches were among the most peculiar of the various forms of
art which the Romans borrowed from those around them, and used with that
strange mixture of splendour and bad taste which characterises all their
works.(From a plate in
Gailhabaud’s ‘Architecture.’)]

These were in the first instance no doubt borrowed from the Etruscans,
as was also the ceremony of the triumph with which they were ultimately
associated.At first they seem rather to have been used as festal
entrances to the great public roads, the construction of which was
considered one of the most important benefits a ruler could confer upon
his country.There was one erected at Rimini in honour of an important
restoration of the Flaminian way by Augustus; another at Susa in
Piedmont, to commemorate a similar act of the same Emperor.Trajan built
one on the pier at Ancona, when he restored that harbour, and another at
Beneventum, when he repaired the Via Appia, represented in the preceding
woodcut (No.It is one of the best preserved as well as most
graceful of its class in Italy.The Arch of the Sergii at Pola in Istria
seems also to have been erected for a like purpose.That of Hadrian at
Athens, and another built by him at Antinoë in Egypt, were monuments
merely commemorative of the benefits which he had conferred on those
cities by the architectural works he had erected within their walls.By
far the most important application of these gateways, in Rome at least,
was to commemorate a triumph which may have passed along the road over
which the arch was erected, and perhaps in some instances they may have
been erected beforehand, for the triumphal procession to pass through,
and of which they would remain memorials.The Arch of Titus at Rome is well known for the beauty of its detail, as
well as from the extraordinary interest which it derives from having
been erected to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem, and consequently
representing in its bassi-rilievi the spoils of the Temple.From the
annexed elevation, drawn to the usual scale, it will be seen that the
building is not large, and it is not so well proportioned as that at
Beneventum, represented in the preceding woodcut, the attic being
overpoweringly high.The absence of sculpture on each side of the arch
is also a defect, for the real merit of these buildings is their being
used as frameworks for the exhibition of sculptural representations of
the deeds they were erected to commemorate.In the later days of the Empire two side arches were added for
foot-passengers, in addition to the carriage-way in the centre.This
added much to the splendour of the edifice, and gave a greater
opportunity for sculptural decoration than the single arch afforded.The
Arch of Septimius Severus, represented to the same scale in Woodcut No.217, is perhaps the best specimen of the class.That of Constantine is
very similar and in most respects equal to this—a merit which it owes to
most of its sculptures being borrowed from earlier monuments.More splendid than either of these is the Arch at Orange.It is not
known by whom it was erected, or even in what age: it is, however,
certainly very late in the Roman period, and shows a strong tendency to
treat the order as entirely subordinate, and to exalt the plain masses
into that importance which characterises the late transitional period.Unfortunately its sculptures are so much destroyed by time and violence
that it is not easy to speak with certainty as to their age; but more
might be done than has hitherto been effected to illustrate this
important monument.At Rheims there is an arch which was probably much more magnificent than
this.When in a perfect state it was 110 ft.in width, and had three
openings, the central one 17 ft.high, and those on each
side 10 ft.in width, each separated by two Corinthian columns.From the
style of the sculpture it certainly was of the last age of the Roman
Empire, but having been built into the walls of the city, it has been so
much injured that it is difficult to say what its original form may have
been.Besides these there is in France a very elegant single-arched gateway at
St.Rémi, similar to and probably of the same age as that at Beneventum;
another at Cavallon, and one at Carpentras, each with one arch.There is
also one with two similar arches at Langres; and one, the Porta Nigra,
at Besançon, which shows so complete a transition from the Roman style
that it is difficult to believe that it does not belong to the
Renaissance.[187] (From Laborde’s
‘Monumens de la France.’)]

There still remains in France another class of arches, certainly not
triumphal, but so similar to those just mentioned that it is difficult
to separate the one from the other.The most important of these are two
at Autun, called respectively the Porte Arroux and the Porte St.André,
a view of which is given in Woodcut No.Each of these has two
central large archways for carriages, and one on each side for
foot-passengers.Their most remarkable peculiarity is the light arcade
or gallery that runs across the top of them, replacing the attic of the
Roman arch, and giving a degree of lightness combined with height that
those never possessed.These gates were certainly not meant for defence,
and the apartment over them could scarcely be applied to utilitarian
purposes; so that we may, I believe, consider it as a mere ornamental
appendage, or as a balcony for display on festal occasions.It appears,
however, to offer a better hint for modern arch-builders than any other
example of its class.Plan of Porta Nigra at Trèves.View of the Porta Nigra at Trèves.]Even more interesting than these gates at Autun is that called the Porta
Nigra at Trèves; for though far ruder in style and coarser in detail, as
might be expected from the remoteness of the province where it is found,
it is far more complete.Indeed it is the only example of its class
which we possess in anything like its original state.Its front consists
of a double archway surmounted by an arcaded gallery, like the French
examples.Within this is a rectangular court which seems never to have
been roofed, and beyond this a second double archway similar to the
first.At the ends of the court, projecting each way beyond the face of
the gateway and the gallery surmounting it, are two wings four storeys
in height, containing a series of apartments in the form of small
basilicas, all similar to one another, and measuring about 55 ft.It is not easy to understand how these were approached, as there is no
stair and no place for one.Of course there must have been some mode of
access, and perhaps it may have been on the site of the apse, shown in
the plan (Woodcut No.219), which was added when the building was
converted into a church in the Middle Ages.These apartments were
probably originally used as courts or chambers of justice, thus
realising, more nearly than any other European example I am acquainted
with, the idea of a gate of justice.Notwithstanding its defects of detail, there is a variety in the outline
of this building and a boldness of profile that render it an extremely
pleasing example of the style adopted; and though exhibiting many of the
faults incidental to the design of the Colosseum, it possesses all that
repetition of parts and Gothic feeling of design which give such value
to its dimensions, though these are far from being contemptible, the
building being 115 ft.wide by 95 in height to the top of the wings.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There probably were many similar gates of justice in the province, but
all have perished, unless we except those at Autun just described.I am
convinced that at that place there were originally such wings as these
at Trèves, and that the small church, the apse of which is seen on the
right hand (woodcut No.220), stands upon the foundations of one of
these.A slight excavation on the opposite side would settle this point
at once.If it could be proved that these gateways at Autun had such
lateral adjuncts, it would at once explain the use of the gallery over
the arch, which otherwise looks so unmeaning, but would be intelligible
as a passage connecting the two wings together.Another form also is that of an arch at the entrance of a bridge,
generally bearing an inscription commemorative of its building.Its
purpose is thus closely connected with that of the arches before
mentioned, which commemorate the execution of roads.Most of the great
bridges of Italy and Spain were so adorned; but unfortunately they have
either been used as fortifications in the Middle Ages, or removed in
modern times to make room for the increased circulation of traffic.That
built by Trajan on his noble bridge at Alcantara in Spain is well known;
and there exists a double-arched bridge at Saintes, in the south of
France.The most elegant and most perfect specimen, however, of this
class is that of St.Chamas in Provence, represented in woodcut No.It consists of two arches, one at each end of the bridge, of singular
elegance of form and detail.Although it bears a still legible
inscription, it is uncertain to what age it belongs, probably that of
the Antonines: and I would account for the purity of its details by
referring to the Greek element that pervades the south of France.Whether this is so or not, it is impossible not to admire not only the
design of the whole bridge with its two arches, but the elegance with
which the details have been executed.Used in this mode as commencements of roads, or entrances to bridges, or
as festal entrances to unfortified towns, there are perhaps no monuments
of the second class more appropriate or more capable of architectural
expression than these arches, though all of them have been more or less
spoiled by an incongruous order being applied to them.Used, however, as
they were in Rome, as monuments of victory, without offering even an
excuse for a passage through them, the taste displayed in them is more
than questionable: the manner, too, in which they were cut up by broken
cornices and useless columns placed on tall pedestals, with other
trivial details highly objectionable, deprive them of that largeness of
design which is the only true merit and peculiar characteristic of Roman
art, while that exquisite elegance with which the Greeks knew so well
how to dignify even the most trivial objects was in them almost entirely
lost.Columns of Victory are a class of monuments which seem to have been used
in the East in very early times, though their history it must be
confessed is somewhat fragmentary and uncertain, and they seem to have
been adopted by the Romans in those provinces where they had been
employed by the earlier inhabitants.Whatever the original may have
been, the Romans were singularly unsuccessful in their application of
the form.They never, in fact, rose above the idea of taking a column of
construction, magnifying it, and placing it on a pedestal, without any
attempt to modify its details or hide the original utilitarian purpose
for which the column was designed.When they attempted more than this,
they failed entirely in elaborating any new form at all worthy of
admiration.The Columna Rostrata, or that erected to celebrate naval
victories, was, so far as we can judge from representations (for no
perfect specimen exists), one of the ugliest and clumsiest forms of
column it is possible to conceive.Of those of Victory, one of the most celebrated is that erected by
Diocletian at Alexandria.A somewhat similar one exists at Arsinoë,
erected by Alexander Severus; and a third at Mylassa in Caria.All these
are mere Corinthian columns of the usual form, and with the details of
those used to support entablatures in porticoes.However beautiful these
may be in their proper place, they are singularly inappropriate and
ungraceful when used as minarets or single columns.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There are two in Rome not quite so bad as these, both being of the Doric
order.Had the square abacus in these been cut to a round form, and
ornamented with an appropriate railing, we might almost have forgotten
their original, and have fancied that they really were round towers with
balconies at the top.The great object of their erection was to serve as
vehicles for sculpture, though, as we now see them, or as they are
caricatured at Paris and elsewhere, they are little more than instances
of immense labour bestowed to very little purpose.As originally used,
these columns were placed in small courts surrounded by open porticoes,
whence the spectator could at two or perhaps at three different levels
examine the sculpture at his leisure and at a convenient distance, while
the absurdity of the column supporting nothing was not apparent, from
its not being seen from the outside.This arrangement is explained in
woodcut No.200, which is a section through the basilica of Trajan,
showing the position of his column, not only with reference to that
building, but to the surrounding colonnade.The same was almost
certainly the case with the column of Marcus Aurelius, which, with
slight modifications, seems to have been copied from that of Trajan; but
even in the most favourable situations no monuments can be less worthy
of admiration or of being copied than these.A far better specimen of this class is that at Cussi, near Beaune, in
France.It probably belongs to the time of Aurelian, but it is not known
either by whom it was erected or what victory it was designed to
celebrate; still that it is a column of victory seems undoubted; and its
resemblance to columns raised with the same object in India is quite
striking.The arrangement of the base serving as a pedestal for eight statues is
not only elegant but appropriate.The ornament which covers the shaft
takes off from the idea of its being a mere pillar, and at the same time
is so subdued as not to break the outline or interfere with constructive
propriety.Supposed Capital of Column at Cussi.]The capital, of the Corinthian order, is found in the neighbourhood used
as the mouth of a well.In its original position it no doubt had a hole
through it, which being enlarged suggested its application to its
present ignoble purpose, the hole being no doubt intended either to
receive or support the statue or emblem that originally crowned the
monument, but of that no trace now remains.There cannot be a more natural mode of monumental expression than that
of a simple upright stone set up by the victors to commemorate their
prowess and success.Accordingly steles or pillars erected for this
purpose are found everywhere, and take shapes as various as the
countries where they stand or the people who erected them.In Northern
Europe they are known as Cath or battle-stones, and as rude unhewn
monoliths are found everywhere.In India they are as elegant and as
elaborately adorned as the Kutub Minar at Delhi, but nowhere was their
true architectural expression so mistaken as in Rome.There, by
perverting a feature designed for one purpose to a totally different
use, an example of bad taste was given till then unknown, though in our
days it has become not uncommon.In that strange collection of the styles of all nations which mingled
together makes up the sum of Roman art, nothing strikes the
architectural student with more astonishment than the number and
importance of their tombs.If the Romans are of Aryan origin, as is
generally assumed, they are the only people of that race among whom
tomb-building was not utterly neglected.The importance of the tombs
among the Roman remains proves one of two things.Either a considerable
proportion of Etruscan blood was mixed up with that of the dominant race
in Rome, or that the fierce and inartistic Romans, having no art of
their own, were led blindly to copy that of the people among whom they
were located.Of the tombs of Consular Rome nothing remains except perhaps the
sarcophagus of Scipio; and it is only on the eve of the Empire that we
meet with the well-known one of Cæcilia Metella, the wife of Crassus,
which is not only the best specimen of a Roman tomb now remaining to us,
but the oldest architectural building of the imperial city of which we
have an authentic date.It consists of a bold square basement about 100
ft.square, which was originally ornamented in some manner not now
intelligible.From this rose a circular tower about 94 ft.in diameter,
of very bold masonry, surmounted by a frieze of ox-skulls with wreaths
joining them, and a well-profiled cornice: two or three courses of
masonry above this seem to have belonged to the original work; and above
this, almost certainly, in the original design rose a conical roof,
which has perished.The tower having been used as a fortress in the
Middle Ages, battlements have been added to supply the place of the
roof, and it has been otherwise disfigured, so as to detract much from
its beauty as now seen.Still we have no tomb of the same importance so
perfect, nor one which enables us to connect the Roman tombs so nearly
with the Etruscan.The only addition in this instance is that of the
square basement or podium, though even this was not unknown at a much
earlier period, as for instance in the tomb of Aruns (Woodcut No.The exaggerated height of the circular base is also remarkable.Here it
rises to be a tower instead of a mere circular base of stones for the
earthen cone of the original sepulchre.The stone roof which probably
surmounted the tower was a mere reproduction of the original earthen
cone.Tomb of Cæcilia Metella.]Next in age and importance was the tomb of Augustus in the Campus
Martius.It is now so completely ruined that it is extremely difficult
to make out its plan, and those who drew and restored it in former days
were so careless in their measurements that even its dimensions cannot
be ascertained; it appears, however, to have consisted of a circular
basement about 300 ft.in height, adorned
with 12 large niches.Above this rose a cone of earth as in the Etruscan
tombs, not smooth like those, but divided into terraces, which were
planted with trees.We also learn from Suetonius that Augustus laid out
the grounds around his tomb and planted them with gardens for public use
during his lifetime.More like the practice of a true Mogul in the East
than the ruler of an Indo-Germanic people in Europe.This tomb, however, was far surpassed, not only in solidity but in
splendour, by that which Hadrian erected for himself on the banks of the
Tiber, now known as the Mole of Hadrian, or more frequently the Castle
of St.The basement of this great tomb was a square, about 340
ft.Above this rose a circular tower 235
ft.The whole was crowned either by a
dome or by a conical roof in steps, which, with its central ornament,
must have risen to a height of not less than 300 ft.The circular or
tower-like part of this splendid building was ornamented with columns,
but in what manner restorers have not been quite able to agree; some
making two storeys, both with pillars, some, one of pillars and the
upper one of pilasters.It would require more correct measurements than
we have to enable us to settle this point, but it seems probable that
there was only one range of columns on a circular basement of some
height surmounted by an attic of at least equal dimensions.The order
might have been 70 ft., the base and attic 35 ft.Internally the mass was nearly solid, there being only one sepulchral
apartment, as nearly as may be in the centre of the mass, approached by
an inclined plane, winding round the whole building, from the entrance
in the centre of the river face.Besides these there was another class of tombs in Rome, called
columbaria, generally oblong or square rooms below the level of the
ground, the walls of which were pierced with a great number of little
pigeon-holes or cells just of sufficient size to receive an urn
containing the ashes of the body, which had been burnt according to the
usual Roman mode of disposing of the dead.Externally of course they had
no architecture, though some of the more important family sepulchres of
this class were adorned internally with pilasters and painted ornaments
of considerable beauty.In the earlier ages of the Roman Empire these two forms of tombs
characterised with sufficient clearness the two races, each with their
distinctive customs, which made up the population of Rome.Long before
its expiration the two were fused together so thoroughly that we lose
all trace of the distinction, and a new form of tomb arose compounded of
the two older, which became the typical form with the early Christians,
and from them passed to the Saracens and other Eastern nations.The new form of tomb retained externally the circular form of the
Pelasgic sepulchre, though constructive necessities afterwards caused it
to become polygonal.Instead however of being solid, or nearly so, the
walls were only so thick as was necessary to support the dome, which
became the universal form of roof of these buildings.The sepulchres of Rome have as yet been far too carelessly examined to
enable us to trace all the steps by which the transformation took place,
but as a general rule it may be stated that the gradual enlargement of
the central circular apartment is almost a certain test of the age of a
tomb; till at last, before the age of Constantine, they became in fact
representations of the Pantheon on a small scale, almost always with a
crypt or circular vault below the principal apartment.Section of Sepulchre at San Vito.One of the most curious transitional specimens is that found near San
Vito, represented in Woodcut No.Here, as in all the earlier
specimens, the principal apartment is the lower, in the square basement.The upper, which has lost its decoration, has the appearance of having
been hollowed out of the frustum of a gigantic Doric column, or rather
out of a solid tower like the central one of the Tomb of Aruns (Woodcut
No.Shortly after the age of this sepulchre the lower apartment
became a mere crypt, and in such examples as those of the sepulchres of
the Cornelia and Tossia families we have merely miniature Pantheons
somewhat taller in proportion, and with a crypt.This is still more
remarkable in a building called the Torre dei Schiavi, which has had a
portico attached to one side, and in other respects looks very like a
direct imitation of that celebrated temple.It seems certainly, however,
to have been built for a tomb.Another tomb, very similar to that of the Tossia family, is called that
of Sta.If it is not hers, it belongs
at any rate to the last days of the Empire, and may be taken as a fair
specimen of the tombs of that age and class.It is a vast transition
from the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, though, like all the changes
introduced by the Romans, it shows the never-failing tendency to
transfer all architectural embellishments from the exterior to the
interior of every style of building.On
this stands a circular tower in two storeys.In the lower storey is a
circular apartment about 66 ft.in diameter, surrounded by eight niches;
in the upper the niches are external, and each is pierced with a window.The dimensions of the tomb are nearly the same as those of Cæcilia
Metella, and it thus affords an excellent opportunity of comparing the
two extremes of the series, and of contrasting the early Roman with the
early Christian tomb.The typical example of a sepulchre of this age is the tomb or baptistery
of Sta.Costanza, the daughter of Constantine (Woodcut No.In this
building the pillars that adorned the exterior of such a mausoleum, for
instance, as that of Hadrian, are introduced internally.Externally the
building never can have had much ornament.But the breaks between the
lower aisle and the central compartment, pierced with the clerestory,
must have had a very pleasing effect.In this example there is still
shown a certain degree of timidity, which does not afterwards reappear.The columns are coupled and are far more numerous than they need have
been, and are united by a fragment of an entablature, as if the
architect had been afraid to place his vault directly on the capitals.Notwithstanding these defects, it is a pleasing and singularly
instructive example of a completed transformation, and is just what we
miss in those secular buildings for which the Christians had no use.Another building, which is now known as the Lateran Baptistery (Woodcut
No.422), was also undoubtedly a place of sepulture.Its erection is
generally ascribed to Constantine, and it is said was intended by him to
be the place of his own sepulture.Whether this is correct or not, it
certainly belongs to his age, and exhibits all the characteristics of
the architecture of his time.Here the central apartment, never having
been designed to support a dome, is of a far lighter construction, an
upper order of pillars being placed on the lower, with merely a slight
architrave and frieze running between the two orders, the external walls
being slight in construction and octagonal in plan.[188] We must not in
this place pursue any further the subject of the transition of style, as
we have already trespassed within the pale of Christian architecture and
passed beyond the limits of Heathen art.So gradual, however, was the
change, and so long in preparation, that it is impossible to draw the
line exactly where the separation actually took place between the two.TEMPLE OF MINERVA MEDICA.One important building remains to be mentioned before leaving this part
of the subject.It commonly goes by the name of the Temple of Minerva
Medica, though this is certainly a misnomer.[189] Recently it has become
the fashion to assume that it was the hall of some bath; no building of
that class, however, was known to exist in the neighbourhood, and it is
extremely improbable that any should be found outside the Servian walls
in this direction; moreover, it is wanting in all the necessary
accompaniments of such an establishment.It is here placed with the tombs, because its site is one that would
justify its being so classed, and its form being just such as would be
applicable to that purpose and to no other.It is not by any means
certain, however, that it is a tomb, though there does not seem to be
any more probable supposition.It certainly belongs to the last days of
the Roman Empire, if indeed it be not a Christian building, which I am
very much inclined to believe it is, for, on comparing it with the
Baptistery of Constantine and the tomb of Sta.Costanza, it shows a
considerable advance in construction on both these buildings, and a
greater similarity to San Vitale at Ravenna, and other buildings of
Justinian’s time, than to anything else now found in Rome.As will be seen from the plan and section (Woodcuts Nos.228 and 229),
it has a dome, 80 ft.in diameter, resting on a decagon of singularly
light and elegant construction.Nine of the compartments contain niches
which give great room on the floor, as well as great variety and
lightness to the general design.Above this is a clerestory of ten
well-proportioned windows, which give light to the building, perhaps not
in so effective a manner as the one eye of the Pantheon, though by a far
more convenient arrangement, to protect from the elements a people who
did not possess glass.So far as I know, all the domed buildings erected
by the Romans up to the time of Constantine, and indeed long afterwards,
were circular in the interior, though, like the temple built by
Diocletian at Spalato, they were sometimes octagonal externally.This,
however, is a Polygon both internally and on the outside, and the mode
in which the dome is placed on the polygon shows the first rudiments of
the pendentive system, which was afterwards carried to such perfection
by the Byzantine architects, but is nowhere else to be found in Rome.It
probably was for the purpose of somewhat diminishing the difficulties of
this construction that the architect adopted a figure with ten instead
of eight sides.Plan of Minerva Medica at Rome, as restored in
Isabelle’s ‘Édifices Circulaires,’ on the theory of its being a Bath.Section of Minerva Medica (from Isabelle.)Rib of the Roof of the Minerva Medica at Rome.]This, too, is, I believe, the first building in which buttresses are
applied so as to give strength to the walls exactly at the point where
it is most wanted.By this arrangement the architect was enabled to
dispense with nearly one-half the quantity of material that was thought
necessary when the dome of the Pantheon was constructed, and which he
must have employed had he copied that building.Besides this, the dome
was ribbed with tiles, as shown in Woodcut No.230, and the space
between the ribs filled in with inferior, perhaps lighter masonry,
bonded together at certain heights by horizontal courses of tiles where
necessary.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

Besides the lightness and variety which the base of this building
derives from the niches, it is 10 ft.higher than its diameter, which
gives to it that proportion of height to width, the want of which is the
principal defect of the Pantheon.It is not known what the side
erections are which are usually shown in the ground-plans, nor even
whether they are coeval with the main central edifice.I suspect they
have never been very correctly laid down.Taking it altogether, the building is certainly, both as concerns
construction and proportion, by far the most scientific of all those in
ancient Rome, and in these respects as far superior to the Pantheon as
it is inferior to that temple in size.Indeed there are few inventions
of the Middle Ages that are not attempted here or in the Temple of
Peace—but more in this than in the latter; so much so, indeed, that I
cannot help believing that it is much more modern than is generally
supposed.As might be expected from our knowledge of the race that inhabited the
European provinces of the Roman Empire, there are very few specimens of
tombs of any importance to be found in them.One very beautiful example
exists at St.Rémi, represented in the annexed woodcut (No.It can
hardly, however, be correctly called a tomb, but is rather a cenotaph or
a monument, erected as the inscription on it tells us, by Sextus and
Marcus, of the family of the Julii, to their parents, whose statues
appear under the dome of the upper storey.There is nothing funereal
either in the inscription or the form, nor anything to lead us to
suppose that the bodies of the parents repose beneath its foundation.The lower portion of this monument is the square basement which the
Romans always added to the Etruscan form of tomb.Upon this stands a
storey pierced with an archway in each face, with a three-quarter pillar
of the Corinthian order at every angle.The highest part is a circular
colonnade, a miniature copy of that which we know to have once encircled
Hadrian’s Mole.The open arrangement of the arches and colonnade, while it takes off
considerably from the tomb-like simplicity appropriate to such
buildings, adds very much to the lightness and elegance of the whole.Altogether the building has much more of the aspiring character of
Christian art than of the more solid and horizontal forms which were
characteristic of the style then dying out.Another monument of very singular and exceptional form is found at Igel,
near Trèves, in Germany.It is so unlike anything found in Italy, or
indeed anything of the Roman age, that were its date not perfectly known
from the inscription upon it, one might rather be inclined to ascribe it
to the age of Francis I. than to the latter days of the Roman Empire.The form is graceful, though the pilasters and architectural ornaments
seem somewhat misplaced.It is covered with sculptures from top to
bottom.These, however, as is generally the case with Roman funereal
monuments, have no reference to death, nor to the life or actions of the
person to whom the monument is sacred, but are more like the scenes
painted on a wall or ornamental stele anywhere.The principal object on
the face represented in the woodcut is the sun, but the subjects are
varied on each face, and, though much time-worn, they still give a very
perfect idea of the rich ornamentation of the monuments of the last age
of the Empire.Monument at Igel, near Trèves.(From Schmidt’s
‘Antiquities of Trèves.’)]

The Tour Magne at Nîmes is too important a monument to be passed over,
though in its present ruined state it is almost more difficult to
explain than any other Roman remains that have reached our times.It
consists of an octagonal tower 50 ft.The basement is extended beyond this tower on every side by a
series of arches supporting a terrace to which access was obtained by an
external flight of steps, or rather an inclined plane.From the marks in
the walls it seems evident that this terrace originally supported a
peristyle, or, possibly, a range of chambers.Within the basement is a
great chamber covered by a dome of rubble masonry, to which no access
could be obtained from without, but the interior may have been reached
through the eye of the dome.From the terrace an important flight of
steps led upwards to—what?It is almost impossible to refrain from
answering, to a cella, like those which crowned the tomb temples of
Assyria.That the main object of the building was sepulchral seems
hardly doubtful, but we have no other instance in Europe of a tomb with
such a staircase leading to a chamber above it.That Marseilles was a Phœnician and then a Phocian colony long before
Roman times seems generally to be admitted, and that in the Temple of
Diana (Woodcuts Nos.188 and 189) and in this building there is an
Etruscan or Eastern element which can hardly be mistaken, and may lead
to very important ethnographical indications when more fully
investigated and better understood.This scarcity of tombs in the western part of the Roman Empire is to a
great extent made up for in the East; but the history of those erected
under the Roman rule in that part of the world is as yet so little known
that it is not easy either to classify or to describe them; and as
nearly all those which have been preserved are cut in the rock, it is
sometimes difficult—as with other rock-cut objects all over the world—to
understand the form of building from which they were copied.The three principal groups of tombs of the Roman epoch are those of
Petra, Cyrene, and Jerusalem.Though many other important tombs exist in
those countries, they are so little known that they must be passed over
for the present.From the time when Abraham was laid in the cave of Machpelah until after
the Christian era, we know that burying in the rock was not the
exception but the general practice among the nations of this part of the
East.So far as can be known, the example was set by Egypt, which was
the parent of much of their civilisation.In Egypt the façades of their
rock-cut tombs were—with the solitary exception of those of Beni
Hasan[190]—ornamented so simply and unobtrusively as rather to belie
than to announce their internal magnificence.All the oldest Asiatic
tombs seem to have been mere holes in the rock, wholly without
architectural decorations.(From Laborde’s ‘Petra and Mount Sinai.’)]

We have seen, however, how the Persian kings copied their palace façades
to adorn their last resting-places, and how about the same time in Lycia
the tomb-builders copied, first their own wooden structures, and
afterwards the architectural façades which they had learned from the
Greeks how to construct.But it was not till the Roman period that this
species of magnificence extended to the places enumerated above; when to
such an extent did it prevail at Petra as to give to that now deserted
valley the appearance of a petrified city of the dead.The typical and most beautiful tomb of this place is that called the
Khasné or Treasury of Pharaoh—represented in elevation and section in
the annexed woodcuts, Nos.As will be seen, it consists of
a square basement, adorned with a portico of four very beautiful
Corinthian pillars, surmounted by a pediment of low Grecian pitch.Above
this are three very singular turrets, the use and application of which
it is extremely difficult to understand.The central one is circular,
and is of a well-understood sepulchral form, the use of which, had it
been more important, or had it stood alone, would have been intelligible
enough; but what are the side turrets?If one might hazard so bold a
conjecture, I would suggest that the original from which this is derived
was a five-turreted tomb, like that of Aruns (Woodcut No.176), or that
of Alyattes at Sardis, which in course of time became translated into so
foreign a shape as this; but where are the intermediate forms?and by
whom and when was this change effected?Before forming any theories on
this subject, it will be well to consider whether all these buildings
really are tombs.Most of them undoubtedly are so; but may not the name
_el Deir_, or the Convent, applied by the Arabs to one of the principal
rock-cut monuments of Petra, be after all the true designation?Are none
of them, in short, cells for priests, like the _viharas_ found in India?All who have hitherto visited these spots have assumed at once that
everything cut in the rock must be a tomb, but I am much mistaken if
this is really the case with all.(From Laborde’s ‘Mount
Sinai,’ p.To return, however, to the Khasné.Though all the forms of the
architecture are Roman, the details are so elegant and generally so well
designed as almost to lead to the suspicion that there must have been
some Grecian influence brought to bear upon the work.The masses of rock
left above the wings show how early a specimen of its class it is, and
how little practice its designers could have had in copying in the rock
the forms of their regular buildings.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’ p.A little further within the city is found another very similar in design
to this, but far inferior to it in detail and execution, and showing at
least a century of degradation, though at the same time presenting an
adaptation to rock-cut forms not found in the earlier examples.A third is that above alluded to, called _el Deir_.This is the same in
general outline as the two former—of an order neither Greek nor Roman,
but with something like a Doric frieze over a very plain Corinthian
capital.In other respects it presents no new feature except the
apparent absence of a door, and on the whole it seems, if finished, to
deserve its name less than either of the other two.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’
p.Perhaps the most singular object among these tombs, if tombs they are,
is the flat façade with three storeys of pillars one over the
other—slightly indicated on the left of the Corinthian tomb in Woodcut
No.It is like the proscenium of some of the more recent Greek
theatres.If it was really the frontispiece to a tomb, it was totally
unsuitable to the purpose, and is certainly one of the most complete
misapplications of Greek architecture ever made.Generally speaking, the interiors of these buildings are so plain that
travellers have not cared either to draw or measure them; one, however,
represented in the annexed woodcut (No.236), is richly ornamented, and,
as far as can be judged from what is published, is as unlike a tomb as
it is like a _vihara_.But, as before remarked, they all require
re-examination before the purpose for which they were cut can be
pronounced upon with any certainty.Façade of Herod’s Tombs, from a Photograph.]The next group of tombs is that at Jerusalem.These are undoubtedly all
sepulchres.By far the greater number of them are wholly devoid of
architectural ornament.To the north of the city is a group known as the
Tombs of the Kings, with a façade of a corrupt Doric order, similar to
some of the latest Etruscan tombs.[191] These are now very much ruined,
but still retain sufficient traces of the original design to fix their
date within or subsequently to the Herodian period without much
possibility of doubt.A somewhat similar façade, but of a form more like
the Greek Doric, found in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, bears the name of
the Sepulchre of St.So-called “Tomb of Zechariah.”]

Close to this is a square tomb, known as that of Zechariah, cut in the
rock, but standing free.Each face is adorned with Ionic pillars and
square piers at the angles, the whole being crowned with a pyramidal
roof.Perhaps this building should properly be called a cenotaph, as it
is perfectly solid, and no cave or sepulchral vault has been found
beneath it, though judging from analogies one might yet be found if
properly looked for.A tomb with an architectural façade, similar to
that of the so-called Tomb of the Judges, does exist behind it cut in
rock, and is consequently of more modern construction.It may be to mark
this that the architectural monolith was left.Close to this is another identical with it in as far as the basement is
concerned, and which is now popularly known as the Tomb of Absalom; but
in this instance the pyramid has been replaced with a structural spire,
and it is probable when this was done that the chamber which now exists
in its interior was excavated.The so-called Tomb of Absalom.]One of the remarkable points in these tombs is the curious jumble of the
Roman orders which they present.The pillars and pilasters are Ionic,
the architraves and frieze Doric, and the cornice Egyptian.The capitals
and frieze are so distinctly late Roman, that we can feel no hesitation
as to their date being either of the age of Herod or subsequent to that
time.In an architectural point of view the cornice is too plain to be
pleasing if not painted; it probably therefore was so treated.Another class of these tombs is represented by the so-called Tomb of the
Judges (Woodcut No.These are ornamented by a tympanum of a Greek
or Roman temple filled with a scroll-work of rich but debased pattern,
and is evidently derived from something similar, though Grecian in
design.In age it is certainly more recent than the so-called Tomb of
Zechariah, as one of precisely similar design is found cut into the face
of the rock out of which that monument was excavated.Façade of the Tomb of the Judges.]The third group is that of Cyrene, on the African coast.Notwithstanding
the researches of Admiral Beechey and of M. Pacho,[192] and the still
more recent explorations of Messrs.Smith and Porcher, above referred to
(p.285), they are still much less perfectly known to us than they
should be.Their number is immense, and they almost all have
architectural façades, generally consisting of two or more columns
between pilasters, like the grottoes of Beni-Hasan, or the Tomb of St.Many of them show powerful evidence of Greek taste,
while some may be as old as the Grecian era, though the greater part are
undoubtedly of Roman date, and the paintings with which many of them are
still adorned are certainly Roman in design.Two of them are illustrated
by Woodcuts Nos.165 and 166: one as showing more distinct evidence of
Greek taste and colour than is to be found elsewhere, though it is
doubtful if it belongs to the Grecian period any more than the so-called
Tomb of St.James at Jerusalem; the other, though of equally uncertain
date, is interesting as being a circular monument built over a cave like
that at Amrith (Woodcut No.122), and is the only other example now
known.None of them have such splendid architectural façades as the
Khasné at Petra; but the number of tombs which are adorned with
architectural features is greater than in that city, and, grouped as
they are together in terraces on the hill-side, they constitute a
necropolis which is among the most striking of the ancient world.Altogether this group, though somewhat resembling that at Castel d’Asso,
is more extensive and far richer in external architecture.[193]


Time has not left us any perfect structural tombs in all these places,
though there can be little doubt but they were once numerous.Almost the
only tomb of this class constructed in masonry known to exist, and which
in many respects is perhaps the most interesting of all, is found in
Asia Minor, at Mylassa in Caria.In form it is something like the
free-standing rock-cut examples at Jerusalem.As shown in the woodcut
(No.242), it consists of a square base, which supports twelve columns,
of which the eight inner ones support a dome, the outer four merely
completing the square.The dome itself is constructed in the same manner
as all the Jaina domes are in India (as will be explained hereafter when
describing that style), and, though ornamented with Roman details, is so
unlike anything else ever built by that people, and is so completely and
perfectly what we find reappearing ten centuries afterwards in the far
East, that we are forced to conclude that it belongs to a style once
prevalent and long fixed in these lands, though this one now stands as
the sole remaining representative of its class.(From ‘Antiquities of Ionia,’
published by the Dilettanti Society.)]Another example, somewhat similar in style, though remotely distant in
locality, is found at Dugga, near Tunis, in Africa.This, too, consists
of a square base, taller than in the last example, surmounted by twelve
Ionic columns, which are here merely used as ornaments.There were
probably square pilasters at the angles, like that at Jerusalem
(Woodcuts Nos.238, 239), while the Egyptian form of the cornice is
similar to that found in these examples, though with the omission of the
Doric frieze.It apparently originally terminated in a pyramid of steps like the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and a large number of structural tombs which
copied that celebrated model.Nothing of this now remains but the four
corner-stones, which were architecturally most essential to accentuate
the weak lines of a sloping pyramid in such a situation.Taken
altogether, perhaps no more graceful monument of its class has come down
to our days than this must have been when complete.Besides these there are in Algeria two tombs of very great interest,
both from their size and the peculiarity of their forms.The best known
is that on the coast a short distance from Algiers to the westward.It
is generally known as the Kubr Roumeïa, or Tomb of the Christian
Virgin—a name it acquired from its having four false doors, each of a
single stone divided into four panels, and the stile between them
forming a cross, which has consequently been assumed to be the Christian
symbol.The building itself, which is circular, and as nearly as may be
200 ft.in diameter, stands on a square platform measuring 210 ft.The
perpendicular part is ornamented by 60 engaged columns of the Ionic
order, and by the four false doors just mentioned; above this rose a
cone—apparently in 40 steps—making the total height about 130 ft.It is,
however, so ruined that it is very difficult to feel sure about its
exact dimensions or form.Plan of the Kubr Roumeïa.(From a plate in Blakesley’s ‘Four
Months in Algeria.’)]

From objects and scribblings of various kinds found in the interior, it
appears to have remained open till nearly the time of the Moslem
conquest, but shortly afterwards to have been closed, and to have defied
all the ingenuity of explorers till a passage was forced in 1866 by
Messrs.MacCarthy and Berbrugger, acting under the orders and at the
expense of the late Emperor Napoleon III.[194] The entrance was found
passing under the sill of the false door on the east from a detached
building standing outside the platform, and which seems to have been
originally constructed to cover and protect the entrance.From this a
winding passage, 560 ft.in length, led to the central chamber where it
is assumed the royal bodies were once deposited, but when opened no
trace of them remained, nor anything to indicate who they were, nor in
what manner they were buried.The other tomb, the Madracen, is very similar to this one, but smaller.Its peristyle is of a sort of Doric order, without bases, and surmounted
by a quasi-Egyptian cornice, not unlike that on the Tomb of Absalom at
Jerusalem (Woodcut No.240), or that at Dugga (Woodcut No.Altogether its details are more elegant, and from their general
character there seems no reason for doubting that this tomb is older
than the Kubr Roumeïa, though they are so similar to each other that
their dates cannot be far distant.[195]

There seems almost no reason for doubting that the Kubr Roumeïa was the
“Monumentum commune Regiæ gentis” mentioned by Pomponius Mela,[196]
about the middle of the first century of our era, and if so, this could
only apply to the dynasty that expired with Juba II., A.D.23, and in
that case the older monument most probably belonged to the previous
dynasty, which ceased to reign with Bocchus III., 33 years before the
birth of Christ.One of the most interesting points connected with these Mauritanian
tombs is their curious similarity to that of Hadrian at Rome.The square
base, the circular colonnade, the conical roof, are all the same.At
Rome they are very much drawn out, of course, but that arose from the
“Mole” being situated among tall objects in a town, and more than even
that, perhaps, from the tendency towards height which manifested itself
so strongly in the architecture of that age.The greatest similarity, however, exists in the interior.The long
winding corridor terminating in an oblong apartment in the centre is an
identical feature in both, but has not yet been traced elsewhere, though
it can be hardly doubted that it must have existed in many other
examples.If we add to these the cenotaph at St.231), we have a
series of monuments of the same type extending over 400 years; and,
though many more are wanted before we can fill up the gaps and complete
the series, there can be little doubt that the missing links once
existed which connected them together.Beyond this we may go still
further back to the Etruscan tumuli and the simple mounds of earth on
the Tartar steppes.At the other end of the series we are evidently
approaching the verge of the towers and steeples of Christian art; and,
though it may seem the wildest of hypotheses to assert that the design
of the spire of Strasbourg grew out of the mound of Alyattes, it is
nevertheless true, and it is only non-apparent because so many of the
steps in the progress from the one to the other have disappeared in the
convulsions of the interval.We know, not only from the descriptions and incidental notices that have
come down to us, but also from the remains found at Pompeii and
elsewhere, that the private dwellings of the Romans were characterised
by that magnificence and splendour which we find in all their works,
accompanied, probably, with more than the usual amount of bad taste.In Rome itself no ancient house—indeed no trace of a domestic
edifice—exists except the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine Mount,
and the house of the Vestal Virgins[197] at its foot; and these even are
now a congeries of shapeless ruins, so completely destroyed as to make
it difficult even for the most imaginative of restorers to make much of
them.The extent of these ruins, however, coupled with the descriptions
that have been preserved, suffice to convince us that, of all the
palaces ever built, either in the East or the West, these were probably
the most magnificent and the most gorgeously adorned.Never in the
world’s history does it appear that so much wealth and power were at the
command of one man as was the case with the Cæsars; and never could the
world’s wealth have fallen into the hands of men more inclined to lavish
it for their own personal gratification than these emperors were.They
could, moreover, ransack the whole world for plunder to adorn their
buildings, and could command the best artists of Greece, and of all the
subject kingdoms, to assist in rendering their golden palaces the most
gorgeous that the world had then seen, or is likely soon to see again.The whole area of the palace may roughly be described as a square
platform measuring 1500 ft.east and west, with a mean breadth of 1300
ft.Owing, however, to its deeply indented
and irregular outline, it hardly covers more ground than the Baths of
Caracalla.Recent excavations have laid bare nearly the whole of the western
portion of this area, and have disclosed the plan of the building, but
all has been so completely destroyed that it requires considerable skill
and imagination to reinstate it in its previous form.The one part that
remains tolerably perfect is the so-called house of Livia the wife of
Augustus, who is said to have lived in it after the death of her
husband.In dimensions and arrangement it is not unlike the best class
of Pompeian houses, but its paintings and decorations are very superior
to anything found in that city.They are, in fact, as might be expected
from their age and position, the finest mural decorations that have come
down to us, and as they are still wonderfully perfect, they give a very
high idea of the perfection of art attained in the Augustan age, to
which they certainly belong.That part of the palace on the Palatine which most impresses the visitor
is the eastern half, which looks on one hand to the Amphitheatre, on the
other to the Baths of Caracalla, and overhangs the Circus Maximius.Though all their marble or painted decorations are gone, the enormous
masses of masonry which here exist convey that impression of grandeur
which is generally found in Roman works.It is not of Æsthetic beauty
arising from ornamental or ornamented construction, but the Technic
expression of power and greatness arising from mass and stability.It is
the same feeling with which we contemplate the aqueducts and engineering
works of this great people; and, though not of the highest class, few
scenes of architectural grandeur are more impressive than the now ruined
Palace of the Cæsars.Notwithstanding all this splendour, this palace was probably as an
architectural object inferior to the Thermæ.The thousand and one
exigencies of private life render it impossible to impart to a
residence—even to that of the world’s master—the same character of
grandeur as may be given to a building wholly devoted to show and public
purposes.In its glory the Palace of the Cæsars must have been the
world’s wonder; but as a ruin deprived of its furniture and ephemeral
splendour, it loses much that would tend to make it either pleasing or
instructive.We must not look for either beauty of proportion or
perfection of construction, or even for appropriateness of material, in
the hastily constructed halls of men whose unbounded power was only
equalled by the coarse vulgarity of their characters.The only palace of the Roman world of which sufficient remains are still
left to enable us to judge either of its extent or arrangements is that
which Diocletian built for himself at Spalato, in Dalmatia, and in which
he spent the remaining years of his life, after shaking off the cares of
Empire.It certainly gives us a most exalted idea of what the splendour
of the imperial palace at Rome must have been when we find one
emperor—certainly neither the richest nor the most powerful—building,
for his retirement, a villa in the country of almost exactly the same
dimensions as the Escurial in Spain, and consequently surpassing in
size, as it did in magnificence, most of the modern palaces of Europe.It is uncertain how far it resembles or was copied from that in Rome,
more especially as it must be regarded as a fortified palace, which
there is no reason to believe that at Rome was, while its model would
seem to have been the prætorian camp rather than any habitation built
within the protection of the city walls.In consequence of this its
exterior is plain and solid, except on the side next the sea, where it
was least liable to attack.The other three sides are only broken by the
towers that flank them, and by those that defend the great gates which
open in the centre of each face.Palace of Diocletian at Spalato.The building is nearly a regular parallelogram, though not quite so.The
south side is that facing the sea, and is 592 ft.from angle to angle;
the one opposite being only 570 in length;[198] while the east and west
sides measure each 698 ft., the whole building thus covering about 9½
English acres.The principal entrance to the palace is on the north, and is called the
Golden Gate, and, as represented in the annexed woodcut (No.247), shows
all the peculiarities of Roman architecture in its last stage.The
horizontal architrave still remains over the doorway, a useless
ornament, under a bold discharging arch, which usurps its place and does
its duty.Above this, a row of Corinthian columns, standing on brackets,
once supported the archivolts of a range of niches—a piece of pleasing
decoration, it must be confessed, but one in which the original purpose
of the column has been entirely overlooked or forgotten.Entering this portal, we pass along a street ornamented with arcades on
either side, till exactly in the centre of the building this is crossed
at right angles by another similar street, proceeding from the so-called
Iron and Brazen Gates, which are similar to the Golden Gate in design,
but are far less richly ornamented.These streets divided the building into four portions: those to the
north are so much ruined that it is not now easy to trace their plan, or
to say to what purpose they were dedicated; but probably the one might
have been the lodgings of the guests, the other the residence of the
principal officers of the household.The whole of the southern half of the building was devoted to the palace
properly so called.It contained two temples, as they are now
designated.That on the right is said to have been dedicated to Jupiter,
though, judging from its form, it would appear to have been designed
rather as the mausoleum of the founder than as a temple of that god.On
the assumption that it was a temple it has been illustrated at a
previous page.[199] Opposite to it is another small temple, dedicated,
it is said, to Æsculapius.Between these two is the arcade represented in Woodcut No.185, at the
upper end of which is the vestibule—circular, as all buildings dedicated
to Vesta, or taking their name from that goddess, should be.This opened
directly on to a magnificent suite of nine apartments, occupying the
principal part of the south front of the palace.Beyond these, on the
right hand, were the private apartments of the emperor, and behind them
his baths.The opposite side is restored as if it exactly corresponded,
but this is more than doubtful; and, indeed, there is scarcely
sufficient authority for many of the details shown in the plan, though
they are, probably, on the whole, sufficiently exact to convey a general
idea of the arrangements of a Roman imperial palace.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia.’)]

Perhaps, however, the most splendid feature in this palace was the great
southern gallery, 515 ft.in length by 24 in width, extending along the
whole seaward face of the building.Besides its own intrinsic beauty as
an architectural feature, it evinces an appreciation of the beauties of
nature which one would hardly expect in a Roman.This great arcade is
the principal feature in the whole design, and commands a view well
worthy the erection of such a gallery for its complete enjoyment.POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM.Failing to discover any example of domestic architecture in Rome, we
turn to Pompeii and Herculaneum, where we find numerous and most
interesting examples of houses of all classes, except, perhaps, the
best; for there is nothing there to compare with the Laurentian villa of
Pliny, or with some others of which descriptions have come down to us.Pompeii, moreover, was far more a Grecian than a Roman city, and its
buildings ought to be considered rather as illustrative of those of
Greece, or at least of Magna Græcia, than of anything found to the
northward.Still these cities belonged to the Roman age, and, except in
taste and in minor arrangements, we have no reason to doubt that the
buildings did resemble those of Rome, at least to a sufficient extent
for illustration.With scarcely an exception, all the houses of Pompeii were of one storey
only in height.It is true that in some we find staircases leading to
the roof, and traces of an upper storey, but where this latter is the
case the apartments would appear to have been places for washing and
drying clothes, or for some such domestic purpose rather than for living
or even sleeping rooms.All the principal apartments were certainly on
the ground floor, and as an almost inevitable corollary from this, they
all faced inwards, and were lighted from courtyards or _atria_, and not
from the outside; for, with a people who had not glass with which to
glaze their windows, it was impossible to enjoy privacy or security
without at the same time excluding both light and air, otherwise than by
lighting their rooms from the interior.Hence it arose that in most
instances the outside of the better class of houses was given up to
shops and smaller dwellings, which opened on to the street, while the
residence, with the exception of the principal entrance, and sometimes
one or two private doors that opened outwards, was wholly hidden from
view by their entourage.Even in the smallest class of tradesmen’s houses which opened on the
street, one apartment seems always to have been left unroofed to light
at least two rooms on each side of it, used as bedrooms; but as the
roofs of all are now gone, it is not always easy to determine which were
so treated.It is certain that, in the smallest houses which can have belonged to
persons at all above the class of shopkeepers, there was always a
central apartment, unroofed in the centre, into which the others opened.Sometimes this was covered by two beams placed in one direction, and two
crossing them at right angles, framing the roof into nine compartments,
generally of unequal dimensions, the central one being open, and with a
corresponding sinking in the floor to receive the rain and drainage
which inevitably came through it.When this court was of any extent,
four pillars were required at the intersection of the beams, or angles
of the opening, to support the roof.In larger courts eight, twelve,
sixteen, or more columns were so employed, often apparently more as
decorative objects than as required by the constructive necessities of
the case, and very frequently the numbers of these on either side of the
apartment did not correspond.Frequently the angles were not right
angles, and the pillars were spaced unequally with a careless disregard
of symmetry that strikes us as strange, though in such cases this may
have been preferable to cold and formal regularity, and even more
productive of grace and beauty.Besides these courts, there generally
existed in the rear of the house another bounded by a dead wall at the
further extremity, and which in the smaller houses was painted, to
resemble the garden which the larger mansions possessed in this
direction.The apartments looking on this court were of course perfectly
private, which cannot be said of any of those looking inwards on the
_atrium_.The house called that of Pansa at Pompeii is a good illustration of
these peculiarities, and, as one of the most regular, has been
frequently chosen for the purpose of illustration.(From Gell’s ‘Pompeii’)
Scale 100 ft to 1 in.]248) all the parts that do not belong
to the principal mansion are shaded darker except the doubtful part
marked A, which may either have been a separate house, or the women’s
apartments belonging to the principal one, or, what is even more
probable, it may have been designed so as to be used for either purpose.B is certainly a separate house, and the whole of the remainder of this
side, of the front, and of the third side, till we come opposite to A,
was let off as shops.At C we have the kitchen and servants’ apartments,
with a private entrance to the street, and an opening also to the
principal peristyle of the house.Returning to the principal entrance or front door D, you enter through a
short passage into the outer court E, on each side of which are several
small apartments, used either by the inferior members of the household
or by guests.A wider passage than the entrance leads from this to the
peristyle, or principal apartment of the house.On the left hand are
several small rooms, used no doubt as sleeping apartments, which were
probably closed by half-doors open above and below, so as to admit air
and light, while preserving sufficient privacy, for Roman tastes at
least.In front and on the right hand are two larger rooms, either of
which may have been the triclinium or dining-room, the other being what
we should call the drawing-room of the house.A passage between the
kitchen and the central room leads to a verandah which crosses the whole
length of the house, and is open to the garden beyond.As will be observed, architectural effect has been carefully studied in
this design, a vista nearly 300 ft.in length being obtained from the
outer door to the garden wall, varied by a pleasing play of light and
shade, and displaying a gradually increasing degree of spaciousness and
architectural richness as we advance.All these points must have been
productive of the most pleasing effect when complete, and of more beauty
than has been attained in almost any modern dwelling of like dimensions.Generally speaking the architectural details of the Pompeian houses are
carelessly and ungracefully moulded, though it cannot be denied that
sometimes a certain elegance of feeling runs through them that pleases
in spite of our better judgment.It was not, however, on form that they
depended for their effect; and consequently it is not by that that they
must be judged.The whole architecture of the house was, but
even this was not considered so important as the paintings which covered
the flat surfaces of the walls.Comparing the Pompeian decoration with
that of the baths of Titus, and those of the House of Livia, the only
specimens of the same age and class found in Rome, it must be admitted
that the Pompeian examples show an equally correct taste, not only in
the choice but in the application of the ornaments used, though in the
execution there is generally that difference that might be expected
between paintings executed for a private individual and those for the
Emperor of the Roman world.Notwithstanding this, these paintings, so
wonderfully preserved in this small provincial town, are even now among
the best specimens we possess of mural decoration.They excel the
ornamentation of the Alhambra, as being more varied and more
intellectual.For the same reason they are superior to the works of the
same class executed by the Moslems in Egypt and Persia, and they are far
superior to the rude attempts of the Gothic architects in the Middle
Ages; still they are probably as inferior to what the Greeks did in
their best days as the pillars of the Pompeian peristyles are to the
porticoes of the Parthenon.But though doubtless far inferior to their
originals, those at Pompeii are direct imitations of true Greek
decorative forms; and it is through them alone that we can form even the
most remote idea of the exquisite beauty to which polychromatic
architecture once attained, but which we can scarcely venture to hope it
will ever reach again.One curious point which has hitherto been too much overlooked is, that
in Pompeii there are two perfectly distinct styles of decoration.One of
these is purely Etruscan, both in form and colour, and such as is only
found in the tombs or on the authentic works of the Etruscans.The other
is no less essentially Greek, both in design and colour: it is far more
common than the Etruscan form, and is always easily to be distinguished
from it.The last-mentioned or Greek style of decoration may be again
divided into two varieties; one, the most common, consisting of
ornaments directly copied from Greek models; the other with a
considerable infusion of Roman forms.This Romanised variety of Greek
decoration represents an attenuated and lean style of architecture,
which could only have come into fashion from the continued use of iron
or bronze, or other metallic substances, for pillars and other
architectural members.Vitruvius reprobates it; and in a later age
Cassiodorus speaks of it in a manner which shows that it was practised
in his time.The general adoption of this class of ornament, both at
Pompeii and in the baths of Titus, proves it to have been a very
favourite style at that time.This being the case, it must have either
been a representation of metallic pillars and other architectural
objects then in use, or it must have been copied from painted
decorations.This is a new subject, and cannot be made clear, except at
considerable length and with the assistance of many drawings.It seems,
however, an almost undoubted fact that the Romans did use metal as a
constructive material.Were it only that columns of extreme tenuity are
represented in these paintings, we might be inclined to ascribe it to
mere incorrect drawing; but the whole style of ornament here shown is
such as is never found in stone or brick pillars, and which is only
susceptible of execution in metal.Besides this, the pillars in question
are always shown in the decorations as though simply gilt or bronzed,
while the representations of stone pillars are.All this
evidence goes to prove that a style of art once existed in which metal
was generally employed in all the principal features, all material
traces of which are now lost.The disappearance of all remains of such a
style is easily accounted for by the perishable nature of iron from
rust, and the value and consequent peculation induced by bronze and
similar metals.We are, moreover, aware that much bronze has been
stolen, even in recent days, from the Pantheon and other buildings which
are known to have been adorned with it.Another thing which we learn from these paintings is, that though the
necessities of street architecture compelled these city mansions to take
a rectilinear outline, whenever the Roman architects built in the
country they indulged in a picturesque variety of outline and of form,
which they carried perhaps as far as even the Gothic architects of the
Middle Ages.This indeed we might have expected, from their carelessness
in respect to regularity in their town-houses; but these were interiors,
and were it not for the painted representations of houses, we should
have no means of judging how the same architects would treat an exterior
in the country.From this source, however, we learn that in the exterior
arrangements, in situations where they were not cramped by confined
space, their plans were totally free from all stiffness and formality.In this respect Roman taste coincided with that of all true architecture
in all parts of the world.Each part of the design was left to tell its own tale and to express the
use to which each apartment was applied, though the whole were probably
grouped together with some reference to symmetry.There is certainly
nothing in these ancient examples to justify the precise regularity
which the architects of the Renaissance introduced into their classical
designs, in which they sought to obliterate all distinction between the
component parts in a vain attempt to make one great whole out of a great
number of small discordant fragments.BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS.Perhaps the most satisfactory works of the Romans are those which we
consider as belonging to civil engineering rather than to architecture.The distinction, however, was not known in those earlier days.The
Romans set about works of this class with a purpose-like earnestness
that always ensures success, and executed them on a scale which leaves
nothing to be desired; while at the same time they entirely avoided that
vulgarity which their want of refinement allowed almost inevitably to
appear in more delicate or more ornate buildings.Their engineering
works also were free from that degree of incompleteness which is
inseparable from the state of transition in which their architecture was
during the whole period of the Empire.It is owing to these causes that
the substructions of the Appian way strike every beholder with
admiration and astonishment; and nothing impresses the traveller more,
on visiting the once imperial city, than the long lines of aqueducts
that are seen everywhere stretching across the now deserted plain of the
Campagna.It is true they are mere lines of brick arches, devoid of
ornament and of every attempt at architecture properly so called; but
they are so well adapted to the purpose for which they were designed, so
grand in conception, and so perfect in execution, that, in spite of
their want of architectural character, they are among the most beautiful
of the remains of Roman buildings.The aqueducts were not, however, all so devoid of architectural design
as those of the Campagna.That, for instance, known as the Pont du Gard,
built to convey water to the town of Nîmes in France, is one of the most
striking works of antiquity.Its height above the stream is about 180
ft., divided into two tiers of larger arches surmounted by a range of
smaller ones, giving the structure the same finish and effect that an
entablature and cornice gives to a long range of columns.Without the
introduction of one single ornament, or of any member that was not
absolutely wanted, this arrangement converts what is a mere utilitarian
work into an architectural screen of a beauty hitherto unrivalled in its
class.The aqueducts of Segovia and Tarragona in Spain, though not perhaps so
grand, are quite as elegant and appropriate as this; and if they stood
across a line of well wooded and watered valleys, might form as
beautiful objects.Unfortunately the effect is much marred by the houses
and other objects that crowd their bases.above the level of their foundation in the centre.That of Segovia
is raised on light piers, the effect of which is perhaps somewhat
spoiled by numerous offsets, and the upper tier is if anything too light
for the lower.These defects are avoided at Tarragona, the central
arches of which are shown in Woodcut No.In this example the
proportion of the upper to the lower arcade is more perfect, and the
whole bears a character of lightness combined with constructive solidity
and elegance unrivalled, so far as I know, in any other work of its
class.It wants, however, the grandeur of the Pont du Gard; for though
its length is about the same, exceeding 800 ft., it has neither its
height nor the impression of power given by the great arches of that
building, especially when contrasted with those that are smaller.Aqueduct of Tarragona.The Roman bridges were designed on the same grand scale as their
aqueducts, though from their nature they of course could not possess the
same grace and lightness.This was, however, more than compensated by
their inherent solidity and by the manifestation of strength imparted by
the Romans to all these structures.They seem to have been designed to
last for ever; and but for the violence of man, it would be hardly
possible to set limits to their durability.Many still remain in almost
every corner of the Roman Empire; and wherever found are easily
recognised by the unmistakable impress of Roman grandeur which is
stamped upon them.One of the most remarkable of these is that which Trajan erected at
Alcantara, in Spain, represented in the annexed woodcut.The roadway is
perfectly level, as is generally the case in Roman bridges, though the
mode by which this is obtained, of springing the arches from different
levels, is perhaps not the most pleasing.To us at least it is
unfamiliar, and has never, I think, been adopted in modern times.In
such a case we should either have made the arches all equal—a mistake,
considering their different heights—or have built solidly over the
smaller arches to bring up the level, which would have been a far
greater error in construction than the other is in taste.The bridge
consists of six arches, the whole length of the roadway being 650 ft.;
the two central arches are about 100 ft.above the level of the stream which it crosses.The piers are well
proportioned and graceful; and altogether the work is as fine and as
tasteful an example of bridge-building as can be found anywhere, even in
these days of engineering activity.Bridge of Trajan, at Alcantara, in Spain.]The bridge which the same Emperor erected over the Danube was a far more
difficult work in an engineering point of view; but the superstructure
being of wood, resting only on stone piers, it would necessarily have
possessed much less architectural beauty than this, or indeed than many
others.These examples of this class of Roman works must suffice; they are so
typical of the style that it was impossible to omit them altogether,
though the subject scarcely belongs in strictness to the objects of this
work.The bridges and aqueducts of the Romans richly deserve the
attention of the architect, not only because they are in fact the only
works which the Romans, either from taste or from social position, were
enabled to carry out without affectation, and with all their originality
and power, but also because it was in building these works that the
Romans acquired that constructive skill and largeness of proportion
which enabled them to design and carry out works of such vast
dimensions, to vault such spaces, and to give to their buildings
generally that size and impress of power which form their chief and
frequently their only merit.It was this too that enabled them to
originate that new style of vaulted buildings which at one period of the
Middle Ages promised to reach a degree of perfection to which no
architecture of the world had ever attained.The Gothic style, it is
true, perished at a time when it was very far from completed; but it is
a point of no small interest to know where and under what circumstances
it was invented.We shall subsequently have to trace how far it advanced
towards that perfection at which it aimed, but to which it never
reached.Strangely enough, it failed solely because of the revival and
the pernicious influence of that very parent style to which it owed its
birth, and the growth and maturity of which we have just been
describing.It was the grandeur of the edifices reared at Rome in the
first centuries of the Empire which so impressed the architects of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that they abandoned their own
beautiful style to imitate that of the Romans, but with an incongruity
which seems inevitably to result from all imitations, as contrasted with
true creations, in architectural art.PARTHIAN AND SASSANIAN ARCHITECTURE.Historical notice—Palaces of Al Hadhr and Diarbekr—Domes—Palaces of

There still remains one other style to be described before leaving the
domain of Heathendom to venture into the wide realms of Christian and
Saracenic art with which the remainder of these two volumes is mainly
occupied.Unfortunately it is not one that was of great importance while
it existed, and it is one of which we know very little at present.This
arises partly from the fact that all the principal buildings of the
Sassanian kings were situated on or near the alluvial plains of
Mesopotamia and were therefore built either of sun-burnt or imperfectly
baked bricks, which consequently crumbled to dust, or, where erected
with more durable materials, these have been quarried by the succeeding
inhabitants of these fertile regions.Partly also it arises from the
Sassanians not being essentially a building race.Their religion
required no temples and their customs repudiated the splendour of the
sepulchre, so that their buildings were mainly palaces.One of these,
that at Dustagird, is described by all contemporary historians[200] as
one of the most gorgeous palaces of the East, but its glories were
ephemeral: gold and silver and precious hangings rich in colour and
embroidery made up a splendour in which the more stable arts of
architecture had but little part, and all perished in an hour when
invaded by the victorious soldiers of Heraclius, or the more destructive
hosts of Arabian invaders a few years afterwards.Whatever the cause
however, never was destruction more complete.Two or three ruined
palaces still exist in Persia and Mesopotamia.A fragment known as the
Tâk Kesra still remains to indicate the spot where Ctesiphon once stood,
but the site of Dustagird is still a matter of dispute.So little in
fact remains that we should hardly be able to form an idea of what the
style really was, but for the fortunate discovery of a palace at Mashita
in Moab, which seems undoubtedly to have been erected by the last great
king of this dynasty, and which is yet unsurpassed for beauty of detail
and richness of ornament by any building of its class and age.As nearly as may be, one thousand years had elapsed since the completion
of the palaces at Persepolis and Susa and the commencement of this
building, and for the great part of that period the history of Persian
or Central Asian architecture is a blank.The Seleucidæ built nothing
that has come down to our times.The Parthians, too, have left us
little, so that it is practically only after a hiatus of nearly six
centuries, that we again begin to feel that the art had not entirely
perished in the populous countries of Central Asia; but even then our
history recommences so timidly and with buildings of such uncertain
dates as to be very far from satisfactory.One of the oldest buildings known as belonging to the new school is the
palace of Al Hadhr, situated in the plain, about thirty miles from the
Tigris, nearly west from the ruins of Kaleh Shergat.The city itself is circular in plan, nearly an English mile in diameter,
and surrounded by a stone wall with towers at intervals, in the centre
of which stands a walled enclosure, nearly square in plan, about 700 ft.This is again subdivided into an outer and inner court by a wall
across its centre.The outer court is unencumbered by buildings, the
inner nearly filled with them.[201] The principal of these is that
represented in plan on Woodcut No.It consists of three large and
four smaller halls placed side by side, with various smaller apartments
in the rear.All these halls are roofed by semicircular tunnel-vaults,
without ribs or other ornament, and they are all entirely open in front,
all the light and air being admitted from the one end.There can be little doubt that these halls are copies, or intended to be
so, of the halls of the old Assyrian palaces; but the customs and
requirements of the period have led the architect on to a new class of
arrangements which renders the resemblance by no means apparent at first
sight.Elevation of part of the Palace of Al Hadhr.The old halls had almost invariably their entrances on the longer side,
which with a vault required very thick external walls as abutments.This
was obviated in Al Hadhr by using the halls as abutments the one to the
other like the arches of a bridge; so that, if the two external arches
were firm, all the rest were safe.This was provided for by making the
outer halls smaller, as shown in the elevation (Woodcut No.254), or by
strengthening the outer wall.But even then the architect seems to have
shrunk from weakening the intermediate walls by making too many openings
in them.Those which do exist are small and infrequent; so that there is
generally only one entrance to each apartment, and that so narrow as to
seem incongruous with the size of the room to which it leads.The square apartment at the back would seem to have been a temple, as
the lintel over the entrance doorway (which faces the east) is carved
with the sun, the moon, and other religious emblems; and the double wall
round may have contained a stair or inclined plane leading to an upper
storey, or to rooms which certainly existed over the smaller halls at
least.All the details of the building are copied from the Roman—the archivolts
and pilasters almost literally so, but still so rudely executed as to
prove that it was not done under the direct superintendence of a Roman
artist.This is even more evident with regard to the griffins and
scroll-work, and the acanthus-leaves which ornament the capitals and
friezes.The most peculiar ornament, however, is the range of masks
carried round all the archivolts of the smaller arches.Of the nineteen
voussoirs of the larger arches, seven of them, according to Ross and
Ainsworth, had figures carved on them in relief of angels, or females,
apparently in the air, and with feet crossed and robes flying loose,
possibly emblematic of the seven planets.Even tradition is silent
regarding the date of these remarkable ruins; the town was besieged
unsuccessfully by Trajan in 116 A.D., and it is recorded to have been a
walled town containing a temple of the sun noted for its rich offerings.This is probably the square building at the back of the great hall on
the left of the palace, and the existence of the carved religious
emblems on the lintel suggest that the palace was erected in front at a
later period.Professor Rawlinson, in his notes on the great
monarchies,[202] suggests about 200 A.D.as the probable date, and
ascribes its erection to the monarchs of the Parthian dynasty.There is
no doubt that the execution of the masonry with its fine joints is of a
totally different character from that which is found in Sassanian
buildings, which comes more under the head of rubble masonry, and was
entirely hidden, in the interior at least, by stucco.The ornament also
is of a rich character, Roman in its design, but debased Greek in its
execution.Loftus, during his researches in Chaldea, discovered at
Wurka (the ancient Erech in Mesopotamia), a large number of ornamental
details, in stone and in plaster, of precisely the same character as
those found at Al Hadhr.Among these remains he found a griffin
resembling those carved on the lintel of the square temple before
referred to, and quantities of Parthian coins, so that it is fair to
assume that Al Hadhr belongs to that dynasty.Another building which merits more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed upon it, is now used as the great mosque at Diarbekr.The
ancient portions consist of the façades only of two palaces, the north
and the south, which face one another at a distance of some 400 feet,
and form the boundaries of the great court (Woodcut No.They are
apparently erected with materials taken from some more ancient building,
and whilst the capitals and friezes are of debased Roman character, the
carved shafts of the north palace (Woodcut No.257) resemble in the
plaster design ornaments found at Wurka.256, which represents the façade of the
South Palace, the openings of the ground storey are spanned by arches of
two different forms; and those of the upper storey by lintels carried on
corbels with relieving arch over; the latter a Byzantine treatment; the
former of a very much later date, and probably Saracenic: above the
openings and under the frieze are Cufic inscriptions.On the whole there
seems little doubt that the building we now see was erected, as it now
stands, at the age of the Cufic inscriptions,[203] whatever they may be,
but that the remains of some more ancient edifice was most skilfully
worked up in the new.Till, however, the building is carefully examined
by some thoroughly competent person, this must remain doubtful.The
building is rich, and so interesting that it is to be hoped that its
history and peculiarities will before long be investigated.Façade of South Palace at Diarbekr.]With the accession of the Sassanians, A.D.223, Persia regained much of
that power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger.The
capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian by the 2nd king of the race, A.D.260, the Conquest of Armenia and victories over Galerius by the 7th
(A.D.296), and the exploits of the 14th King, Bahram Gaur, his visit to
India and his alliance with its kings, all point to extended power
abroad; while the improvement in the fine arts at home indicates
returning prosperity and a degree of security unknown since the fall of
the Achæmenidæ.These kings seem to have been of native race, and claimed descent from
the older dynasties: at all events they restored the ancient religion
and many of the habits and customs with which we are familiar as
existing before the time of Alexander the Great.View in the Court of the Great Mosque at Diarbekr.]As before remarked, fire-worship does not admit of temples, and we
consequently miss that class of buildings which in all ages best
illustrates the beauties of architecture; and it is only in a few
scattered remains of palaces that we are able to trace the progress of
the style.Such as they are, they indicate considerable originality and
power, but at the same time point to a state of society when attention
to security hardly allowed the architect the free exercise of the more
delicate ornaments of his art.The Sassanians took up the style where it was left by the builders of Al
Hadhr; but we only find it after a long interval of time, during which
changes had taken place which altered it to a considerable extent, and
made it in fact into a new and complete style.They retained the great tunnel-like halls of Al Hadhr, but only as
entrances.They cut bold arches through the dividing walls, so as to
form them into lateral suites.But, above all, they learnt to place
domes on the intersections of their halls, not resting on drums, but on
pendentives,[204] and did not even attempt to bring down simulated lines
of support to the ground.Besides all these constructive peculiarities,
they lost all trace of Roman detail, and adopted a system of long
reed-like pilasters, extending from the ground to the cornice, below
which they were joined by small semicircular arches.They in short
adopted all the peculiarities which are found in the Byzantine style as
carried out at a later age in Armenia and the East.We must know more of
this style, and be able to ascribe authentic dates to such examples as
we are acquainted with, before we can decide whether the Sassanians
borrowed the style from the Eastern Romans, or whether they themselves
were in fact the inventors from whom the architects of the more western
nations took the hints which they afterwards so much improved upon.The various steps by which the Romans advanced from the construction of
buildings like the Pantheon to that of the church of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople are so consecutive and so easily traced as to be
intelligible in themselves without the necessity of seeking for any
foreign element which may have affected them.If it really was so, and
the architecture of Constantinople was not influenced from the East, we
must admit that the Sassanian was an independent and simultaneous
invention, possessing characteristics well worthy of study.It is quite
certain too that this style had a direct influence on the Christian and
Moslem styles of Asia, which exhibit many features not derivable from
any of the more Western styles.Section on line A B of Palace at Serbistan.A few examples will render this clearer than it can be made in words.258 and 259) of a small but
interesting palace at Serbistan will explain most of the peculiarities
of the style.The entrances, it will be observed, are deep tunnel-like
arches, but the centre is covered by a dome resting on pendentives.In
the palace of Firouzabad these are constructed by throwing a series of
arches across the angles, one recessed behind the other, the lower ones
serving as centres for those above, until a circular base for the dome
has been obtained; but here in Serbistan they do not seem to have known
this expedient: the lower courses run through to the angle, and the
upper ones are brought forward in so irregular and unscientific a way as
to suggest that for their support they placed their reliance almost
entirely on the tenacious qualities of the mortar.That which, however,
would have formed the outer arch of the pendentive is wrought on the
stone down almost to the springing, as if the builder of Serbistan had
seen regular arched pendentives of some kind, but did not know how to
build them.This is the more remarkable because, as we shall see later
on, they knew how to construct semi-domes over their recesses or square
niches, and in regular coursed masonry; if they had applied these to the
angles, they would have invented the squinch, a kind of pendentive
employed in Romanesque work in the south of France.The dome is
elliptical, as are also the barrel vaults over the entrances, the
recesses in the central hall, and the vaults over the lateral halls.In
these lateral halls piers are built within the walls, forming a series
of recesses; these either have transverse arches thrown across them
where the lofty doorways come, or are covered with semidomes in regular
coursed masonry, the angles being filled in below them with small
arches.The lower portions of the piers consist of circular columns
about six feet high, behind which a passage is formed.The builders thus
obtained the means of counteracting the thrust of the vault, without
breaking the external outline by buttresses and without occupying much
room on the floor, while at the same time these projections added
considerably to the architectural effect of the interior.The date of
the building is not correctly known, but it most probably belongs to the
age of Shapour, in the middle of the fourth century.The palace at Firouzabad is probably a century more modern, and is
erected on a far more magnificent scale, being in fact the typical
building of the style, so far at least as we at present know.(From Flandin and Coste.)]As will be seen in the plan, the great central entrance opens laterally
into two side chambers, and the inner of these into a suite of three
splendid domed apartments, occupying the whole width of the building.Beyond this is an inner court, surrounded by apartments all opening upon
it.261, representing one of the
doorways in the domed halls, the details have nothing Roman about them,
but are borrowed directly from Persepolis, with so little change that
the style, so far as we can now judge, is almost an exact reproduction,
except that the work is only surface ornament in plaster, and is an
irregular and a degraded copy of the original stone features at
Persepolis.The opening also is spanned by a circular arch under the
lintel of the Persian example, the former being the real constructive
feature, the latter a decorative imitation.The portion of the exterior
represented in Woodcut No.262 tells the same tale, though for its
prototype we must go back still further to the ruins at Wurka—the
building called Wuswus at that place (see p.165) being a palace
arranged very similarly to these, and adorned externally by panellings
and reeded pilasters, differing from these buildings only in detail and
arrangement, but in all essentials so like them as to prove that the
Sassanians borrowed most of their peculiarities from earlier native
examples.The building itself is a perfectly regular parallelogram, 332 ft.by
180, without a single break, or even an opening of any sort, except the
one great arch of the entrance; and externally it has no ornament but
the repetition of the tall pilasters and narrow arches represented in
Woodcut No.Its aspect is thus simple and severe, but more like a
gigantic Bastile than the palace of a gay, pavilion-loving people, like
the Persians.Internally the arrangement of the halls is simple and appropriate, and,
though somewhat too formal, is dignified and capable of considerable
architectural display.On the whole, however, its formality is perhaps
less pleasing than the more picturesque arrangements of the palace at
Serbistan last described.Part of External Wall, Firouzabad.Another century probably elapsed before Khosru (Nushirvan) commenced the
most daring, though certainly not the most beautiful ever attempted by
any of his race; for to him we must ascribe the well-known Tâk Kesra
(Woodcuts Nos.263, 264), the only important ruin that now marks the
site of the Ctesiphon of the Greeks—the great Modain of the Arabian
conquerors.As it is, it is only a fragment of a palace, a façade similar in
arrangement to that at Firouzabad, but on a much larger scale, its width
being 312 ft., its height 105 to 110, and the depth of the remaining
block 170 ft.In the centre is a magnificent portal, the Aiwan, or
Throne room of the palace, vaulted over with an elliptical barrel vault
and similar to the smaller vestibules of Serbistan and Firouzabad; the
lower portion of the arch, the springing of which is about 40 ft.from
the ground, is built in horizontal courses up to 63 ft.above the
ground, above which comes the portion arched with regular voussoirs; by
this method not only was an enormous centering saved, but the thrust of
that portion built with voussoirs was brought well within the thickness
of the side walls.It is probable that the front portion of the arch,
about 20 ft.in depth, was built on walls erected temporarily for that
purpose; the remainder of the vault, however, was possibly erected
without centres, the bricks being placed flatwise and the rings being
inclined at an angle of about 10° towards the back of the front arch.The tenacious quality of the mortar was probably sufficient to hold the
bricks in their places till the arch ring was complete, so that the
centering was virtually a template only, giving the correct form of the
ellipse, and constructed with small timbers so as to save expense.A
similar method of construction was found by Sir Henry Layard in the
drain vaults at Nimroud, and it exists in the granaries built by Rameses
II.Daniel travelled to the kitchen.in the rear of the Rameseum at Thebes.The lower or inner portion of
the great arch is built in four rings of bricks or tiles laid flatwise,
two of which are carried down to the springing of the whole arch: above
these in the upper portion of the arch comes a ring 3 feet in height,
regularly built in voussoir-shaped bricks breaking joint, on the surface
of which are cut a series of seventeen foils, the whole being crowned by
a slightly projecting moulding.These have nothing to do with the
construction, and are simply a novel method of decoration carved after
the arch was built.Plan of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.(From Flandin and
Coste.)Elevation of Great Arch of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.The wall flanking the great arch on either side is decorated with
buttress shafts and blind arches, which are partially constructive, and
intended to support and strengthen those portions of the wall which were
simply screens, or to resist the thrust of the walls of the vaulted
chambers behind, consisting of one storey only.Decoratively they divide
up the front and were apparently introduced in imitation of the great
Roman amphitheatres.The position occupied by these semi-detached shafts
on the first storey (resting on the ledge left by the greater thickness
of wall of the lower storey), which are not in the axes of those below,
proves that the Sassanian architect thought more of their constructive
value as buttresses, than of their architectural value as superimposed
features.Sketch Plan of Palace at Mashita.]Though it may not perhaps be beautiful, there is certainly something
grand in a great vaulted entrance, 72 ft.in height and
115 in depth, though it makes the doorway at the inner end and all the
adjoining parts look extremely small.It would have required the rest of
the palace to be carried out on an unheard-of scale to compensate for
this defect.The Saracenic architects got over the difficulty by making
the great portal a semidome, and by cutting it up with ornaments and
details, so that the doorway looked as large as was required for the
space left for it.Here, in the parent form, all is perfectly plain in
the interior, and painting alone could have been employed to relieve its
nakedness, which, however, it never would have done effectually.[205]

The ornaments in these and in all the other buildings of the Sassanians
having been executed in plaster, we should hardly be able to form an
idea of the richness of detail they once possessed but for the fortunate
discovery of a palace erected in Moab by Khosru Purviz, the last great
monarch of this line.[206]

As will be seen from the woodcut (No.265), the whole building is a
square, measuring above 500 ft.each way, but only the inner portion of
it, about 170 ft.square, marked E E, has been ever finished or
inhabited.It was apparently originally erected as a hunting-box on the
edge of the desert for the use of the Persian king, and preserves all
the features we are familiar with in Sassanian palaces.It is wholly in
brick, and contains in the centre a triapsal hall, once surmounted by a
dome on pendentives like those at Serbistan or Firouzabad.On either
side were eight vaulted halls with intermediate courts almost identical
with those found at Eski Bagdad[207] or at Firouzabad.So far there is
nothing either remarkable or interesting, except the peculiarity of
finding a Persian building in such a situation, and in the fact that the
capitals of the pillars are of that full-curved shape which are first
found in the works of Justinian, which so far helps to fix the date of
the building.It seems, however, that at a time when Chosroes possessed all Asia and
part of Africa, from the Indus to the Nile, and maintained a camp for
ten years on the shores of the Bosphorus, in sight of Constantinople,
that this modest abode no longer sufficed for the greatest monarch of
the day.He consequently determined to add to it the enclosure above
described, and to ornament it with a portal which should exceed in
richness anything of the sort to be found in Syria.Unfortunately for
the history of art, this design was never carried out.When the walls
were raised to the height of about twenty feet, the workmen were called
off, most probably in consequence of the result of the battle of Nineveh
in 627; and the stones remain half hewn, the ornament unfinished, and
the whole exactly as if left in a panic, never to be resumed.Interior of ruined triapsal Hall of Palace.]The length of the façade—marked A A in plan, Woodcut No.265—between the
plain towers, which are the same all round, is about 170 ft.,[208] the
centre of which was occupied by a square-headed portal flanked by two
octagonal towers.Each face of these towers was ornamented by an
equilateral triangular pediment, filled with the richest sculpture.267, two large animals are represented facing
one another on the opposite sides of a vase, on which are two doves, and
out of which springs a vine which spreads over the whole surface of the
triangle, interspersed with birds and bunches of grapes.In another
panel one of the lions is represented with wings, evidently the last
lineal descendant of those found at Nineveh and Persepolis, and in all
are curious hexagonal rosettes, carved with a richness far exceeding
anything found in Gothic architecture, but which are found repeated with
very little variation in the Jaina temples of western India.One Compartment of Western Octagon Tower of the
Persian Palace at Mashita.]The wing walls of the façade are almost more beautiful than the central
part itself.As on the towers, the ornamentation consists of a series of
triangles filled with incised decorations and with rosettes in their
centres; while, as will be observed in Woodcut No.265, the decoration
in each panel is varied, and all are unfinished.The cornice only exists
at one angle, and the mortice stones never were inserted that were meant
to keep it in its place.Enough however remains to enable us to see
that, as a surface decoration, it is nearly unrivalled in beauty and
appropriateness.As an external form I know nothing like it.It is only
matched by that between the arches of the interior of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople, which is so near it in age that they may be considered
as belonging to the same school of art.Part of West Wing Wall of External Façade of Palace
at Mashita.Elevation of External Façade of the Mashita, as
restored by the Author.]Notwithstanding the incomplete state in which this façade was left,
there does not seem much difficulty in restoring it within very narrow
limits of certainty.The elevation cannot have differed greatly from
that shown in Woodcut No.In the first place
there must have been a great arch over the entrance doorway—this is _de
rigueur_ in Sassanian art, and this must have been stilted or
horse-shoed, as without that it could not be made to fit on to the
cornice in the towers, and all the arches in the interior take, as I am
informed, that shape.Besides this there is at Takt-i-Gero[209] a
Sassanian arch of nearly the same age and equally classical in design,
which is, like this one, horse-shoed to the extent of one-tenth of its
diameter; and at Urgub, in Asia Minor, all the rock-cut excavations
which are of this or an earlier age have this peculiarity in a marked
degree.[210]

Above this, the third storey, is a repetition of the lowest, on half its
scale—as in the Tâk Kesra,—but with this difference, that here the
angular form admits of its being carried constructively over the great
arch, so that it becomes a facsimile of an apse at Murano near
Venice,[211] which is adorned with the spoils of some desecrated
building of the same age, probably of Antioch or some city of Syria
destroyed by the Saracens.Above this the elevation is more open to
conjecture, but it is evident that the whole façade could not have been
less than 90 ft.in height, from the fact that the mouldings at the base
(Woodcut No.265) are the mouldings of a Corinthian column of that
height, and no architect with a knowledge of the style would have used
such mouldings four and a half feet in height, unless he intended his
building to be of a height equal at least to that proportion.The domes
are those of Serbistan or of Amrith (Woodcut No.122); but such domes
are frequent in Syria before this age, and became more so afterwards.The great defect of the palace at Mashita as an illustration of
Sassanian art arises from the fact that, as a matter of course, Chosroes
did not bring with him architects or sculptors to erect this building.He employed the artists of Antioch or Damascus, or those of Syria, as he
found them.He traced the form and design of what he wanted, and left
them to execute it, and they introduced the vine—which had been the
principal “motif” in such designs from the time of Herod till the Moslem
invasion—and other details of the Byzantine art with which Justinian had
made them familiar from his buildings at Jerusalem, Antioch, and
elsewhere.Exactly the same thing happened in India six centuries later.When the Moslems conquered that country in the beginning of the
thirteenth century they built mosques at Delhi and Ajmere which are
still among the most beautiful to be found anywhere.The design and
outline are purely Saracenic, but every detail is Hindu, but, just as in
this case, more exquisite than anything the Moslems ever did afterwards
in that country.Though it thus stands almost alone, the discovery of this palace fills a
gap in our history such as no other building occupies up to the present
time.And when more, and more correct, details have been procured, it
will be well worthy of a monograph, which can hardly be attempted now
from the scanty materials available.Its greatest interest, however,
lies in the fact that all the Persian and Indian mosques were derived
from buildings of this class.The African mosques were enlargements of
the _atria_ of Christian basilicas, and this form is never found there,
but it is the key to all that was afterwards erected to the eastward.The palace of Rabbath Ammon (Woodcuts Nos.270, 271), also in Moab,
consists of a central court open to the sky, and four recesses or
transepts, one on each face; two of these are covered with elliptical
barrel vaults, and two with semidomes carried on pendentives.The
decoration of this palace is similar to that found at Mashita, but not
so rich in design or so good in its execution.The remains of two other palaces have been found in Persia, one at
Imumzade, which consists of a dome on pendentives, and a second, called
the Tag Eiran, made known to us by M. Dieulafoy, and published in his
work on the ancient art of Persia.[212] The latter is probably a late
example, for it shows a considerable advance in construction, and is
lighted by clerestory windows between the brick transverse arches which
span the hall.The plan consisted of a central hall, covered over by a
dome carried on pendentives, and two wings; of the original building,
only one of these wings remains, and two sides of the central hall, in
both cases up to the springing of the real arch, the lower courses being
horizontal as in the arch at Ctesiphon.Arch of Chosroes at Takt-i-Bostan.(From Flandin and
Coste.)]In the dearth of Sassanian buildings there is one other monument that it
is worth while quoting before closing this chapter.It is an archway or
grotto, which the same Chosroes cut in the rock at Takt-i-Bostan, near
Kermanshah (Woodcut No.Though so far removed from Byzantine
influence it is nearly as classical as the palace at Mashita.The flying
figures over the arch are evident copies of those adorning the triumphal
arches of the Romans, the mouldings are equally classical, and though
the costumes of the principal personages, and of those engaged in the
hunting scenes on either hand, partake more of Assyria than of Rome, the
whole betrays the influence of his early education and the diffusion of
Western arts at that time more than any other monument we know of.The
statue of Chosroes on his favourite black steed “Shubz diz,” is original
and interesting, and, with many of the details of this monument, it has
been introduced into the restoration of Mashita.This, it must be confessed, is but a meagre account of the architecture
of a great people.Perhaps it may be that the materials do not exist for
making it more complete; but what is more likely is that they have not
yet been looked for, but will be found when attention is fairly directed
to the subject.In the meanwhile what has been said regarding it will be
much clearer and better understood when we come to speak of the
Byzantine style, which overlapped the Sassanian, and was to some extent
contemporary with it.If a line were drawn north and south from Memel on the shores of the
Baltic to Spalato on the Adriatic, it would divide Europe into nearly
equal halves.All that part lying to the west of the line would be found
to be inhabited by nations of Celtic or Teutonic races, and all those to
the eastward of it by nations of Sclavonic origin, if—as we must do—we
exclude from present consideration those fragments of the effete
Turanian races which still linger to the westward, as well as the
intrusive hordes of the same family which temporarily occupy some fair
portions to the eastward of the line so drawn.This line is not of course quite straight, for it follows the boundary
between Germany on the one hand, and Russia and Poland on the other as
far as Cracow, while it crosses Hungary by the line of the Raab and
separates Dalmatia from Turkey.Though Sclavonic influences may be
detected to the westward of the boundary, they are faint and underlie
the Teutonic element; but to the eastward, the little province of
Siebenburgen, in the north-east corner of Hungary, forms the only little
oasis of Gothic art in the desert of Panslavic indifference to
architectural expression.Originally it was a Roman, afterwards a
German, colony, and maintained its Gothic style throughout the Middle
Ages.[213]

From Spalato the line crosses the Adriatic to Fermo, and then following
very closely the 43rd parallel of latitude, divides Italy into two
nearly equal halves.Barbarian tribes settled to a certain extent to the
northward of this boundary and influenced the style of architecture in
some degree; while to the southward of it, their presence can with
difficulty be detected, except in a few exceptional cases, and for a
very limited time.Architecturally all the styles of art practised during the Middle Ages
to the westward and northward of this boundary may be correctly and
graphically described as the Gothic style, using this term in a broad
sense.All those to the eastward may with equal propriety be designated
as the Byzantine style of art.Anterior, however, to the former there existed a transitional style
known as Romanesque, but which was virtually at first nothing more than
debased Roman.It was, in fact, a modification of the classical Roman
form which was introduced between the reigns of Constantine and
Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt to adapt classical forms to
Christian purposes.At first the materials of ancient buildings sufficed
for its wants, and if after the 4th century the style did not lapse into
absolute barbarism it was due to the influence which the Proto-Byzantine
style began to exert and to the magnificent works erected by Greek
artists at Parenzo and Grado in Dalmatia, at Ravenna, Milan, and even in
Rome herself.To the eastward of the line of demarcation the transition
was perfected under the reign of Justinian (A.D.527 to 564), when it
became properly entitled to the name of Byzantine.To the westward, in
Italy and the south of France, this first phase of the Romanesque
continued to be practised till the 6th or 7th centuries; but about that
time occurs an hiatus in the architectural history of Western Europe,
owing to the troubles which arose on the dissolution of the Roman Empire
and the irruption of the Barbarian hordes.When the art again
reappeared, it was strongly tinctured by Barbarian influences, and might
with propriety be designated the _Gothic style_, the essential
characteristic being that it is the architecture of a people differing
from the Romans or Italians in blood, and, it need hardly be added,
differing from them in a like ratio in their architectural conceptions.The term “Gothic,” however, is so generally adopted throughout Europe to
designate the style in which the intersecting vault with pointed arches
is the main characteristic, that to depart from it, even when subdivided
into round arched and pointed arched Gothic, would only lead to
confusion.It would therefore seem better to retain the nomenclature
usually employed in modern architectural works, and to class all the
phases of the transitional style between the Roman and the Gothic
periods under the broad title of Romanesque.This would include what we
have termed Early Christian——Lombardi——Rhenish——those phases of the
style which in Italy and France are influenced by Byzantine detail——the
pure Romanesque or Romance of the south of France——the Norman style in
Italy, Sicily, and the North of France, and——Saxon and Norman in our own
country.The attempt to restrict the term Romanesque within the confines
of the 6th and 7th centuries, which was formerly attempted, has proved
to be illusory, as it has never been recognised by any student of
architecture.At the same time it is not necessary to insist on the term
when describing its various phases, and when they are better known under
other terms.It is, however, of importance, when writing a general
history of all styles, to keep strictly to some definite system, and not
to adopt the nomenclature which has in some cases been given by persons
writing monographs of the style of their own particular country.The
Germans, for instance, are inclined to call the architecture of such
cathedrals as Spires, Worms, etc., by the absurd name of Byzantine,
though no features in them have ever been borrowed from the Eastern
capital, nor do they resemble the buildings of that part of Europe.The title Gothic, which was originally invented as a term of reproach,
and which was applied to the imaginary work of the western Barbarians
who at one time overthrew the western Empire and settled within its
limits, has no architectural or ethnological value, it being impossible
to point out any features, much less buildings, which the Goths
introduced, and which are not to be more correctly attributed to Roman
or Byzantine artists.If we except the tomb of Theodoric, all the works
in Ravenna are scarcely to be distinguished from the basilicas of the
Eastern Empire, and only embody such modifications as the material of
the country and a certain influence of debased Roman architecture in
Italy would naturally exert.The churches and thermæ which Theodoric is
said to have restored in Rome have no characteristics which are not
found in other buildings of the same class before his reign, and even in
Spain and the south of France, which was occupied more or less
continuously by the Visigoths for more than two centuries, there are no
features which they could claim to have invented.The term Gothic, therefore, is misplaced, but inasmuch as the Goths
never invented any style, there is not likely, if this fact is
recognised, to be any confusion in its adoption.The chief difficulty which presents itself in any attempt to classify
the work of the Romanesque and the Gothic styles is that of drawing a
line of demarcation between the two.It is not sufficient to take the
pointed arch, for in France a pointed arched barrel vault preceded the
round arched vault; and in the East, as we know, the pointed arch made
its appearance at a much earlier period: that characteristic, therefore,
must not be too rigidly insisted upon.Beyond this general classification, the use of local names, when
available, will always be found most convenient.First, the country, or
architectural province, in which an example is found should be
ascertained, so that its locality may be marked, and if possible with
the addition of a dynastic or regal name to point out its epoch.When
the outline is sufficiently marked, it may be convenient, as the French
do, to speak of the style of the 13th century[214] as applied to their
own country.The terms they use always seem to be better than 1st, or
2nd, Middle Pointed, or even “Geometric,” “Decorated,” or
“Perpendicular,” or such general names as neither tell the country nor
the age, nor even accurately describe the style, though when they have
become general it may seem pedantic to refuse to use them.The system of
using local, combined, and dynastic names has been followed in
describing all the styles hitherto enumerated in this volume, and will
be followed in speaking of those which remain to be described; and as it
is generally found to be so convenient, whenever it is possible it will
be adhered to.In order to carry out these principles, the division proposed for this
part of the subject is—

1st.To begin the history of Christian Art by tracing up the successive
developments of the earliest perfected style, the Byzantine, in the
countries lying to the eastward of the boundary line already defined.Owing to the greater uniformity of race, the thread of the narrative is
far more easily followed to the eastward than we shall find to the
westward of the line.The Byzantine empire remained one and undivided
during the Middle Ages; and from that we pass by an easy gradation to
Russia, where the style continued to be practised till Peter the Great
superseded it by introducing the styles of Western Europe.To treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy,
down to the age of Charlemagne, so long, in fact, as it remained a
debased Roman style influenced only by its connection with the Eastern
Empire.Continuing our description of the various phases of the style as
practised in Italy and in Istria and Dalmatia (the two countries with
which she was so intimately connected) down to the revival of classic
architecture: subdividing it into those sections which are suggested by
the predominant influence of Lombardic, Byzantine, or Gothic art, and
keeping as far as possible to a chronological sequence.To take up the Romanesque style in France, and to follow it through
its various phases whilst it was being gradually absorbed in the
predominant impetus given to its successor, the Gothic style, by the
adoption of the pointed arch in intersecting vaulting during the 12th
century, and then its subsequent development in succeeding centuries,
till it perished under Francis I.

If this arrangement is not quite logical, it is certainly convenient, as
it enables us to grasp the complete history of the style in the country
where most of the more important features were invented and perfected.Having once mastered the history of Gothic art in the country of its
birth, the sequence in which the other branches of the style are
followed become comparatively unimportant.The difficulty of arranging
them does not lie so much in the sequence as in the determination of
what divisions shall be considered as separate architectural provinces.In a handbook, subdivision could hardly be carried too far; in a
history, a wider view ought to be taken.On the whole, perhaps, the
following will best meet the true exigencies of the case:—

4th.Belgium and Holland should be taken up after France as a separate
province during the Middle Ages, while at the same time forming an
intermediate link between that country and Germany.Though not without important ethnographical distinctions, it will
be convenient to treat all the German-speaking countries from the Alps
to the Baltic as one province.If Germany were taken up before France,
such a mode of treatment would be inadmissible; but following the
history of the art in that country, it may be done without either
confusion or needless repetition.Scandinavia follows naturally as a subordinate, and, unfortunately,
not very important, architectural subdivision.From this we pass by an easy gradation to the British Islands,
which in themselves contain three tolerably well-defined varieties of
style, popularly known as the Saxon, the Norman, or round-arched, and
the Gothic, or pointed-arched style of Architecture.Spain might have been made to follow France, as most of its
architectural peculiarities were borrowed from that country; but some
too own a German origin, while on the whole the new lessons to be
learned from a study of her art are so few, that it is comparatively
unimportant in what sequence the country is taken, and therefore it has
been found more convenient to place her last.BOOK I.

The term Byzantine has of late years been so loosely and incorrectly
used—especially by French writers on architecture—that it is now
extremely difficult to restrict it to the only style to which it really
belongs.Wherever a certain amount of  decoration is employed,
or a peculiar form of carving found, the name Byzantine is applied to
churches on the Rhine or in France; although no similar ornaments are
found in the Eastern Empire, and though no connection can be traced
between the builders of the Western churches and the architects of
Byzantium, or the countries subject to her sway.Strictly speaking, the term ought only to be applied to the style of
architecture which arose in Byzantium and the East after Constantine
transferred the government of the Roman Empire to that city.It is
especially the style of the Greek Church as contradistinguished from
that of the Roman Church, and ought never to be employed for anything
beyond its limits.The only obstacle to confining it to this definition
occurs between the ages of Constantine and Justinian.Up to the reign of
the last-named monarch the separation between the two churches was not
complete or clearly defined, and the architecture was of course likewise
in a state of transition, sometimes inclining to one style, sometimes to
the other.After Justinian’s time, the line may be clearly and sharply
drawn, and it would therefore be extremely convenient if the term “Greek
architecture” could be used for the style of the Greek Church from that
time to the present day.If that term be inadmissible, the term “Sclavonic” might be applied,
though only in the sense in which the Gothic style could be designated
as Teutonic.Both, however, imply ethnographic distinctions which it
would not be easy to sustain.The term “Gothic” happily avoids these,
and so would “Greek,” but for the danger of its being confounded with
“Grecian,” which is the proper name for the classical style of the
ancient Greeks.If the employment of either of these terms is deemed
inadvisable, it will be necessary to divide the style into Old and New
Byzantine—the first comprehending the three centuries of transition that
elapsed from Constantine to the Persian war of Heraclius and the rise of
the Mahomedan power, which entirely changed the face of the Eastern
Empire,—the second, or Neo-Byzantine, including all those forms which
were practised in the East from the reappearance of the style, in or
after the 8th century, till it was superseded by the Renaissance.Thus divided, the true or old Byzantine style might be regarded as the
counterpart of the early Romanesque or debased Roman style, except that,
owing to the rapid development in the East, the former culminated in the
erection of Sta.532-558); the Eastern Empire thus forming
a style of its own of singular beauty and perfection, which it left to
its Sclavonic successors to use or abuse as their means or tastes
dictated.The Western Empire, on the contrary, was in a state of decay
ending in a _débâcle_, from which the Romanesque style only partially
emerged during the reign of Charlemagne and his successors with a new
revival in the 11th century.Though the styles of the East and the West became afterwards so
distinctly separate, we must not lose sight of the fact, that during the
age of transition (324-622) no clear line of demarcation can be traced.Constantinople, Rome, and Ravenna were only principal cities of one
empire, throughout the whole of which the people were striving
simultaneously to convert a Pagan into a Christian style, and working
from the same basis with the same materials.[215] Prior to the age of
Constantine one style pervaded the whole empire.The buildings at
Palmyra, Jerash, or Baalbec, are barely distinguishable from those of
the capital, and the problem of how the Pagan style could be best
converted to Christian uses was the same for all.The consequence is,
that if we were at present writing a history which stopped with the
beginning of the 7th century, the only philosophical mode of treating
the question would be to consider the style as one and indivisible for
that period; but as the separation was throughout steadily, though
almost imperceptibly, making its way, and gradually became fixed and
permanent, it will be found more convenient to assume the separation
from the beginning.This method will no doubt lead to some repetition,
but that is a small inconvenience compared with the amount of clearness
obtained.At the same time, if any one were writing a history of
Byzantine architecture only, it would be necessary to include Ravenna,
and probably Venice and some other towns in Italy and Sicily, in the
Eastern division.On the other hand, in a history devoted exclusively to
the Romanesque styles, it would be impossible to omit the churches at
Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Thessalonica, and elsewhere in the East.Under
these circumstances, it is necessary to draw an arbitrary line
somewhere; and for this purpose the western limits of the Turkish Empire
and of Russia will answer every practical purpose.Eastward of this line
every country in which the Christian religion at any time prevailed may
be considered as belonging to the Byzantine province.During the first three centuries of the style (324-622) it will be
convenient to consider the whole Christian East as one architectural
province.When our knowledge is more complete, it may be possible to
separate it into several, but at present we are only beginning to see
the steps by which the style grew up, and are still very far from the
knowledge requisite for such limitations, even if it should hereafter be
discovered that a sufficient number exist.All the great churches with
which Constantine and his immediate successors adorned their new capital
have perished.Like the churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, they were
probably constructed with wooden roofs and even wooden architraves, and
thus soon became a prey to the flames in that most combustible of
capitals.Christian architecture has been entirely swept off the face of
the earth at Antioch, and very few and imperfect vestiges are found of
the seven churches of Asia Minor.Still, the recent researches of De
Vogüé in Northern Syria,[216] and of Texier in Thessalonica[217] show
how much unexpected wealth still remains to be explored, and in a few
years more this chapter of our history may assume a shape as much more
complete than what is now written, as it excels what we were compelled
to be content with when the Handbook was published, 1855.Since therefore, under present circumstances, no ethnographic treatment
of the subject seems feasible, the clearest mode of presenting it will
probably be to adopt one purely technical.For this purpose it will be found convenient, first, to separate the
Neo-Byzantine style from the older division, which, in order not to
multiply terms, may be styled the Byzantine _par excellence_; the first
chapter extending from Constantine, 324, to the Hejira, 622; and the
second from that time to the end of the Middle Ages.In reference to the ecclesiastical architecture of the first division,
it is proposed to treat—

First, of churches of the basilican or rectangular forms, subdividing
them into those having wooden, and those having stone roofs.Secondly, to describe circular churches in the same manner, subdividing
them similarly into those with wooden roofs, and those with stone roofs
or true domes.This subdivision will not be necessary in speaking of the Neo-Byzantine
churches, since they all have stone roofs and true domes.With regard to civil or domestic architecture very little can at present
be said, as so little is known regarding it, but we may hope that, a few
years hence, materials will exist for an interesting chapter on even
this branch of the subject.Churches at Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Thessalonica—Rectangular Churches
  in Syria and Asia Minor, with wooden roofs and stone vaults.Basilicas may be subdivided into two classes—that in which the nave is
divided from the side-aisles by pillars, carrying either entablatures or
arches, as the most purely Romanesque—and that which has piers
supporting arches only, and is transitional between the first style and
the more original forms which were elaborated out of it.Of the former class one of the most authentic and perfect is that
erected at Bethlehem by Helena, the mother of Constantine, in front of
the cave of the Nativity.The nave seems to be a nearly unaltered
example of this age, with the advantage over the contemporary churches
at Rome, that all its pillars and their capitals were made for the
places they occupy, whereby the whole possesses a completeness and
justness of proportion not found in the metropolis.Its dimensions,
though sufficient for effect, are not large, being internally 103 ft.The choir with its three apses does
not seem to be part of the original arrangement, but to have been added
by Justinian when he renovated—Eutychius says rebuilt—the church.My
impression is that a detached circular building, external to the
basilica, originally contained the entrance to the cave.The frescoes
were added apparently in the 11th or 12th century.[218]

One of the principal points of interest connected with this church is,
that it enables us to realise the description Eusebius gives us of the
basilica which Constantine erected at Jerusalem in honour of the
Resurrection.Like this church it was five-aisled, but had galleries;
the apse also was on a larger scale than could well have been possible
in the Bethlehem church, and adorned with twelve pillars, symbolical of
the Apostles.Of this building nothing now remains, and the only portion which could
be claimed as part of Constantine’s work is the western wall of the
Rotunda, which to a height of 15 to 20 ft.was cut out of the solid rock
in order to isolate the Holy Sepulchre in the centre.The so-called
tombs of Absalom and Zachariah in the valley of Jehoshaphat were
detached in a similar way from the rock behind them.[219]


                             THESSALONICA.Eski Djuma, Thessalonica.As before mentioned, it is to Constantinople, or Alexandria, or Antioch,
that we should naturally look to supply us with examples of the style of
the early transition, but as these fail, it is to Thessalonica alone—in
so far as we now know—that we can turn.In that city there are two
ancient examples.One, now known as the Eski Djuma or old mosque
(Woodcut No.274), may belong to the 5th century, though there are no
very exact data by which to fix its age.It consists of a nave,
measuring, exclusive of narthex and bema, 93 ft.across by 120 ft.—very
much the proportion of the Bethlehem church, but having only three
aisles, the centre one 48 ft.Demetrius, is larger, but less simple.It is five-aisled, has two
internal transepts, and various adjuncts.Altogether it seems a
considerable advance towards the more complicated form of a Christian
church.Both these churches have capacious galleries, running above the
side aisles, and probably devoted to the accommodation of the women.Demetrius is most probably among the first years of the
sixth century.[220] The general ordinance of the columns will be
understood from the woodcut (No.Generally they are placed on
elevated square or octagonal bases, or pedestals, as in the tepidaria of
the Thermæ in Rome, and all have a block (known as the dosseret), placed
above the capital, which is supposed to represent the entablature of the
Roman example, but is probably an original feature inserted over the
capital to support the springing of the arch.In this form it is found
very generally in the 5th and 6th centuries, after which it fell into
disuse, an increased depth being given to the abacus of the capital to
take its place.Demetrius at Thessalonica, A.D.So far as we now know, there is only one church of this class at
Constantinople—that known as St.John Studius,—a three-aisled basilica,
125 ft.Its date appears to be tolerably
well ascertained as A.D.463, and from this circumstance, as well as its
being in the metropolis, it shows less deviation from the classical type
than the provincial examples just quoted.The lower range of columns
supporting the gallery still retain the classical outline and support a
horizontal entablature (Woodcut No.277); the upper supporting arches
have very little resemblance to the classical type, and are wanting in
the architrave block or dosseret, which in fact never seems to have been
admired in the capital.The country where—so far at least as we at present know—the Byzantine
Basilica was principally developed was Northern Syria.Already in De
Vogüé’s work on Central Syria some dozen churches are indicated having
the aisles divided from the naves by pillars supporting arches.One of
these only—that at Soueideh—has five aisles, all the rest three.Almost
all have plain semicircular apses, sometimes only seen internally, like
those mentioned further on (page 510), but sometimes also projecting, as
was afterwards universally the fashion.Two at least have square
terminations (Kefr Kileh and Behioh), but this seems exceptional.Most
of them are almost the size of our ordinary parish churches—100 ft.by
60 or thereabouts—and all belong to the three centuries—the 4th, 5th,
and 6th—of which this chapter especially treats.The church at Baquoza may serve as a type of the class both in plan and
section (Woodcuts Nos.by 105; and besides the narthex—not shown in the section—it has four
lateral porches.It has also two square chapels or vestries at the end
of the aisles—an arrangement almost universal in these churches.The most remarkable of the group, however, is that of St.Simeon
Stylites, at Kalat Sema’n, about 20 miles east of Antioch.Its
dimensions are very considerable, being 330 ft.long, north and south,
and as nearly as may be, 300 ft.east and west, across what may be
called the transepts.The centre is occupied by a great octagon, 93 ft.across, on a rock in the centre of which the pillar of that eccentric
saint originally stood.This apparently was never roofed over, but stood
always exposed to the air of heaven.[221]

[Illustration: 278.Plan of Church and Part of Monastic Buildings at
Kalat Sema’n.The greater part of the conventual buildings belonging to this church
still remain in a state of completeness,—a fact which will be startling
to those who are not aware how many of the great religious
establishments of Syria still stand entire, wanting only the roofs,
which were apparently the only parts constructed of wood.The whole of the buildings at Kalat Sema’n seem to have been completed
within the limits of the 5th century, and not to have been touched or
altered since they were deserted, apparently in consequence of the
Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century.The most curious point is that
such a building should have remained so long in such a situation,
unknown to the Western world; for the notices hitherto published have
been meagre and unsatisfactory in the extreme, and De Vogüé is only able
to state that it was visited and described by the historian Evagrius in
the year 560 A.D.In the same province we find also the earliest examples of the use of
pier arches in a church to separate the nave from the aisles.These seem
to have been currently used in Northern Syria in the 6th century, though
not found in the West—at least not used in the same manner—for several
centuries later.Generally three such arches only were employed in the
length of the nave, and they consequently left the floor so open and
free, that it is very questionable if in churches of limited dimensions
the introduction of a much larger number by the Gothic architects was an
improvement.Taking it altogether, it is probable that such a church as
that at Roueiha (Woodcut No.282) would, if literally reproduced, make a
better and cheaper church for an English parish than the Mediæval models
we are so fond of copying.A considerable amount of perspective effect
is obtained by throwing two transverse arches across the nave, dividing
it into three compartments, each including four windows in the
clerestory; and the whole design is simple and solid in a degree seldom
surpassed in buildings of its class.In many of these churches the transverse arches of the nave are omitted;
and when, as at Qalb Louzeh (Woodcut No.284), the clerestory is
accentuated by roofing shafts, the same effect of perspective is
obtained by other means, and perhaps as successfully.It is very
interesting, however, to find that as early as the 6th century the
architects were thoughtfully feeling their way towards those very
principles of design which many centuries afterwards enabled the Gothic
architects to produce their most successful effects.The introduction of
four windows over each great arch, and of a rooting-shaft between each
to support the beams of the roof, was a happy thought, and it is
wonderful it was so completely lost sight of afterwards.Plan of Church at Qalb Louzeh.Apse of Church at Qalb Louzeh.It is probable that the apse (Woodcut No.284) was originally adorned
with paintings or mosaics, or at least that it was intended it should be
so ornamented; but even as it is, it is so well proportioned to the size
of the church, and to its position, and so appropriately ornamented,
that it is better than most of those found in Roman basilicas; and, for
a small church, is a more dignified receptacle for the altar than either
the French chevet or the English chancel.Did our limits admit of it, it would be not only pleasant but
instructive to dwell longer on this subject; for few parts of our
inquiry can be more interesting than to find that, as early as the 6th
century, the Roman basilica had been converted into a Christian church,
complete in all its details, and—internally at least—in a style of
architecture as consistent and almost as far removed from its classical
prototype as the Mediæval Gothic itself.Externally, too, the style was becoming independent of classical models,
though hardly in the same degree.The porches of the churches were
generally formed in two storeys, the lower having a large central arch
of admission, the upper consisting of a colonnade which partially hid,
while it supported, an open screen of windows that admitted a flood of
light into the nave just in the position where it was most effective.Without glass or mullions such a range of windows must have appeared
weak, and would have admitted rain; but when sheltered by a screen of
pillars, it was both convenient and artistic.Elevation of Chapel at Babouda.This mode of lighting is better illustrated at Babouda, where it is
employed in its simplest form.No light is admitted to the chapel except
through one great semicircular window over the entrance, and this is
protected externally by a screen of columns.This mode of introducing
light, as we shall afterwards see, was common in India at this age, and
earlier, all the Chaitya caves being lighted in the same manner; and for
artistic effect it is equal, if not superior, to any other which has yet
been invented.The light is high, and behind the worshipper, and thrown
direct on the altar, or principal part of the church.In very large
buildings it could hardly be applied, but for smaller ones it is
singularly effective.The external effect of these buildings though not so original as the
interior, is still very far removed from the classical type, and
presents a variety of outline and detail very different from the
simplicity of a Pagan temple.One of the most complete is that at
Tourmanin (Woodcut No.287), though that at Qalb Louzeh is nearly as
perfect, but simpler in detail.For a church of the 6th century it is
wonderful how many elements of later buildings it suggests; even the
western towers seem to be indicated, and, except the four columns of the
gallery, there is very little to recall the style out of which it arose.Façade of Church at Tourmanin.There are considerable remains of a wooden-roofed basilica at Pergamus,
which may be even older than those just described; but having been built
in brick, and only faced with stone—the whole of which is gone—it is
difficult to feel sure of the character of its details and mouldings.It
had galleries on either side of the nave, but how these were supported
or framed is not clear.It may have been by wooden posts or marble
pillars, and these would have either decayed or been removed.The two
square calcidica or vestries, which in the Syrian churches terminate the
side-aisles, are here placed externally like transepts, and beyond them
are two circular buildings with domical roofs and square apses.What
their use was is, however, doubtful.In fact, we know so little of the
architecture of that age in Asia Minor that this building stands quite
exceptionally; and very little use can be made of it, either as throwing
light on other buildings, or as receiving illustration from their
peculiarities.But seeing how much has been effected in this direction
of late, we may fully hope that this state of isolation will not long
remain.One other church of the 4th century is known to exist—at Nisibin.It is
a triple church, the central compartment being the tomb of the founder,
the first Armenian bishop of the place.Though much ruined, it still
retains the mouldings of its doorways and windows as perfect as when
erected, the whole being of fine hard stone.These are identical in
style with the buildings of Diocletian at Spalato; and as their date is
well known, they will, when published, form a valuable contribution to
the information we now possess regarding the architecture of this
period.CHURCHES WITH STONE ROOFS.All the buildings above described—with the exception of the chapel at
Babouda—have wooden roofs, as was the case generally with the basilicas
and the temples of the classical age.The Romans, however, had built
temples with aisles and vaulted them as early as the age of Augustus, as
at Nîmes, for instance (Woodcut No.189), and they had roofed their
largest basilicas and baths with intersecting vaults.We should not
therefore feel surprised if the Christians sometimes attempted the same
thing in their rectangular churches, more especially as the dome was
always a favourite mode of roofing circular buildings; and the problem
which the Byzantine architects of the day set themselves to solve was—as
we shall presently see—how to fit a circular dome of masonry to a
rectangular building.One of the earliest examples of a stone-roofed church is that at Tafkha
in the Hauran.It is probably of the age of Constantine, though as
likely to be before his time as after it.Its date, however, is not of
very great importance, as its existence does not prove that the form was
adopted from choice by the Christians: the truth being that, in the
country where it is found, wood was never used as a building material.All the buildings, both domestic and public, are composed wholly of
stone—the only available material for the purpose which the country
afforded.In consequence of this, when that tide of commercial
prosperity which rose under the Roman rule flowed across the country
from the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, the inhabitants had
recourse to a new mode of construction, which was practically a new
style of architecture.This consisted in the employment of arches
instead of beams.These were placed so near one another that flat stones
could be laid side by side from arch to arch.Over these a layer of
concrete was spread, and a roof was thus formed so indestructible that
whole towns remain perfect to the present day, as originally constructed
in the first centuries of the Christian era.[222]

[Illustration: 289.Section on A B, Tafkha.Section on C D, Tafkha.]Half Front Elevation, Tafkha.One example must suffice to explain this curious mode of construction.The church at Tafkha is 50 ft.It is
spanned by four arches, 7 ft.On each side are galleries of
flat slabs resting on brackets, as shown in Woodcuts Nos.289, 291,
which again are supported by smaller transverse arches.At one side is a
tower, but this is roofed wholly by bracketing, as if the architect
feared the thrust of the arch even at that height.The defect of this arrangement as an architectural expedient is the
extreme frequency of the piers, 8 or 10 ft.being the greatest distance
practicable; but as a mechanical expedient it is singularly ingenious.More internal space is obtained with a less expenditure of material and
danger from thrust than from any mode of construction—wholly of
stone—that we are acquainted with; and with a little practice it might
no doubt be much improved upon.The Indian architects, as we shall
presently see, attempted the same thing, but set about it in a
diametrically opposite way.They absolutely refused to employ the arch
under any circumstances, but bracketed forward till the space to be
covered was so limited that a single stone would reach across.By this
means they were enabled to roof spaces 20 or 25 ft.span without arches,
which is about the interval covered with their aid at Tafkha.[223]

[Illustration: 293.Another circumstance which renders these Hauran examples interesting to
the architectural student is that they contain no trace or reminiscence
of wooden construction or adornment, so apparent in almost every other
style.In Egypt, in Greece, in India, in
Persia—everywhere, in fact—we can trace back the principal form of
decoration to a wooden original; here alone all is lithic, and it is
probably the only example of the sort that the whole history of
architecture affords.If there are any churches in the Byzantine province of the age of which
we are treating, whose naves are roofed by intersecting vaults, they
have not yet been described in any accessible work; but great
tunnel-vaults have been introduced into several with effect.One such is
found at Hierapolis, on the borders of Phrygia (Woodcut No.It is
divided by a bold range of piers into three aisles, the centre one
having a clear width of 45 ft.The internal dimensions of the
church are 177 ft.There are three great piers in the length,
which carry bold transverse ribs so as to break the monotony of the
vault, and have between them secondary arches, to carry the galleries.There is another church at the same place, the roof of which is of a
somewhat more complicated form.The internal length, 140 ft., is divided
into three by transverse arches; but its great peculiarity is that the
vault is cut into by semi-circular lunettes above the screen side-walls,
and through these the light is introduced.This arrangement will be
understood from the section (Woodcut No.Taken altogether, there
is probably no other church of its age and class in which the vault is
so pleasingly and artistically arranged, and in which the mode of
introducing the light is so judicious and effective.The age of these two last churches is not very well ascertained.They
probably belong to the 5th, and are certainly not later than the 6th,
century; but, before we can speak with certainty on the subject, more
examples must be brought to light and examined.From our present
knowledge it can hardly be doubted that a sufficient number do exist to
complete the chapter; and it is to be hoped they will be published,
since a history of vaults in the East, independent of domes, is still a
desideratum.CIRCULAR OR DOMICAL BUILDINGS.Circular Churches with wooden roofs and with true domes in Syria and
  Thessalonica—Churches of St.Sergius and Bacchus and Sta.Sophia,
  Constantinople—Domestic Architecture—Tombs.At the time of the erection of the churches described in the last
chapter, a circular domical style was being simultaneously elaborated in
the East, which not only gave a different character to the whole style,
but eventually entirely superseded the western basilican form, and
became an original and truly Byzantine art.Constantine is said to have erected a church at Antioch which, from the
description given by Eusebius, was octagonal in plan.On Mount Gerizim, on or near the site of the Samaritan temple, Justinian
built an octagonal church showing in its multifold chapels a
considerable advance towards Christian arrangements; it has, however
been so completely destroyed that only its foundation can now be traced,
from which the plan (Woodcut No.296) was measured and worked out by Sir
Charles Wilson.At Bosra in the Hauran there is a church of perfectly well-ascertained
date—A.D.512—which, when more completely illustrated, will throw
considerable light on the steps by which a Pagan temple was transformed
into a Christian church.It is a building externally square, but
internally circular (Woodcut No.in
diameter, and was evidently covered with a wooden roof, according to M.
de Vogüé, supported on eight piers.The interest of the plan consists in
its showing the progress made in adapting this form to Christian
purposes, and it is to be hoped that further investigation may enable us
to supply all the steps by which the transformation took place.De Vogüé
is of opinion that there was a central dome carried on piers and columns
similar to the church of SS.Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, with
aisles round and gallery over them, the latter covered with a timber
roof, the holes in which the rafters were fixed being still visible.Owing to want of lateral support the dome fell down, and at a later
period a small basilica church was erected within the enclosure in front
of the apse; the proximity of the piers of this church suggests that it
was covered with stone slabs according to the custom of the country.The
inscription over the principal entrance door states that the church was
dedicated to SS.Sergius and Bacchus, and was completed in the 400th
year of Bosra (511-512 A.D.).Another example exists at Kalat Sema’n, in
Northern Syria, and presents a combination of an octagonal with a
rectangular church very common in Armenia and Georgia.As is generally
the case there, they are very small in dimensions, the whole group only
measuring 120 ft.Their actual destination is not known, but M.
de Vogüé suggests that the triapsal arrangement in the octagonal
building points to its having been erected as a baptistery.This group
is situated about 200 yards from the main buildings illustrated in
Woodcut (No.Section of Double Church at Kalat Sema’n.Plan, Kalat Sema’n.Whether the dome of the Pantheon at Rome (p.320) was erected in the
time of the Antonines, or before the time of Augustus, as was formerly
supposed, it is evident that the Romans had conquered the difficulties
of domic construction long before the transference of the seat of power
to Byzantium; the Pantheon being, up to this hour, the largest (single)
dome ever constructed by the hand of man.Simple and grand as it
undoubtedly is, it had several glaring defects in its design which the
Byzantines set themselves to remedy.The first was that twice the
necessary amount of materials was consumed in its construction.The
second, that the mode of lighting by a hole in the roof, which also
admitted the rain and the snow, was most objectionable before the
invention of glass.The third, that a simply circular plan is always
unmeaning and inconvenient.A fourth, that a circular building can
hardly, by any contrivance, be made to fit on to any other buildings or
apartments.In the Minerva Medica (Woodcut No.229) great efforts were made, but not
quite successfully, to remedy these defects.The building would not fit
on to any others, and, though an improvement on the design of the
Pantheon, was still far from perfect.The first step the Byzantines made was to carry the dome on arches
resting on eight piers enclosing an octagon A (Woodcut No.300); this
enabled them to obtain increased space, to provide nave, choir, and
transepts, and by throwing out niches on the diagonal lines, virtually
to obtain a square hall in the centre.The difference between the
octagon and circle is so slight, that by corbelling out above the
extrados of the arches, a circular base for the dome was easily obtained
B. The next step was to carry the dome on arches resting on four piers,
and their triumph was complete when by the introduction of
pendentives—represented by the shaded parts at D (Woodcut No.301), they
were enabled to place the circular dome on a square compartment.The
pendentives and dome thus projected formed part of a sphere, the radius
of which was the half-diagonal of the square compartment.Constructively
it would probably have been easier to roof the space by an intersecting
vault; and even if of 100 or 150 ft.span it would without difficulty
have been effected.The difference between the intersecting vault and
the dome (as shown in Woodcuts 302 and 303; the former the tomb of Galla
Placidia, built 450 A.D., the latter the chapel of St.Peter Crysologus
attached to the archiepiscopal palace of about the same date, and both
in Ravenna) is perhaps the most striking contrast the history of
architecture affords between mechanical and ornamental construction.Both are capable of being ornamented to the same extent and in the same
manner; but the difference of form rendered the dome a beautiful object
in itself wholly irrespective of ornament, whereas the same cannot
always be said of the intersecting barrel vault.Altogether, the effect
would have been architecturally so infinitely inferior, that we cannot
but feel grateful to the Byzantines that they persevered, in spite of
all mechanical temptations, till they reached the wonderful perfection
of the dome of Sta.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.Chapel in Archiepiscopal Palace, Ravenna.]Among the earliest domical churches found in the East is that of St.It is also, perhaps, the finest example of its
class belonging strictly to that group which has been designated above
as the Eastern Romanesque.As will be seen from the plan it is a circular apartment, 79 ft.in
diameter, surrounded by walls 20 ft.in thickness, into which are cut
seven great niches; two apparently serving as entrances, opposite one of
which is a bema or presbytery of considerable importance and purely
Christian form.The dome is hemispherical, pierced at its base by eight
semi-circular lunettes, and externally covered and concealed by a wooden
roof.This form of roof is first found in the West at Nocera dei Pagani
(p.547), but the dome there is only half the diameter of this one, and
of a very different form and construction.George’s
retains its internal decorations, which are among the earliest as well
as the most interesting Christian mosaics in existence.[224] The
architecture presented in them bears about the same relation to that in
the Pompeiian frescoes which the Jacobæan does to classical
architecture, and, mixed with Christian symbols and representations of
Christian saints, makes up a most interesting example of early Christian
decoration.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]No inscriptions or historical indications exist from which the date of
the church can be fixed.We are safe, however, in asserting that it was
erected by Christians, for Christian purposes, subsequently to the age
of Constantine.If we assume the year 400 as an approximate date we
shall probably not err to any great extent, though the real date may be
somewhat later.Plan of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun (Syria).How early a true Byzantine form of arrangement may have been introduced
we have no means of knowing; but as early as the year 285—according to
De Vogüé—we have a Kalybe[225] at Omm-es-Zeitoun, which contains all the
elements of the new style.It is square in plan, with a circular dome in
its centre for a roof.The wing walls which extend the façade are
curious, but not singular.One other example, at least, is found in the
Hauran, at Chaqqa, and there may be many more.View of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun.Still, in the Hauran they never seem quite to have fallen into the true
Byzantine system of construction, but preferred one less mechanically
difficult, even at the expense of crowding the floor with piers.In the
church at Ezra, for instance, the internal octagon is reduced to a
figure of sixteen sides before it is attempted to put a dome upon it,
and all thought of beauty of form, either internally or externally, is
abandoned in order to obtain mechanical stability—although the dome is
only 30 ft.As the date of this church is perfectly ascertained (510) it forms a
curious landmark in the style just anterior to the great efforts
Justinian was about to make, and which forced it so suddenly into its
greatest, though a short-lived, degree of perfection.As before mentioned, all the churches of the capital which were erected
before the age of Justinian, have perished, with the one exception of
that of St.This may in part be
owing to the hurried manner in which they were constructed, and the
great quantity of wood consequently employed, which might have risked
their destruction anywhere.It is, however, a curious, but
architecturally an important, fact that Byzantium possessed every
conceivable title to be chosen as the capital of the Empire, except the
possession of a good building-stone, or even apparently any suitable
material for making good bricks.Wood seems in all times to have been
the material most readily obtained and most extensively used for
building purposes, and hence the continual recurrence of fires, from
before the time of Justinian down to the present day.That monarch was
the first who fairly met the difficulty; the two churches erected during
his reign, which now exist, are constructed wholly without wood or
combustible materials of any sort—and hence their preservation.The earliest of these two, popularly known as the “Kutchuk Agia Sophia,”
or lesser Sta.Sophia, was originally a double church, or more properly
speaking two churches placed side by side, precisely in the same manner
as the two at Kalat Sema’n (Woodcut No.The basilica was dedicated
to the Apostles Peter and Paul; the domical church, appropriately, to
the Martyrs Sergius and Bacchus.The former has entirely disappeared,
from which I would infer that it was constructed with pillars and a
wooden roof.[226] The latter remains very nearly intact.The frescoes
and mosaics have, indeed, disappeared from the body of the church,
hidden, it is to be hoped, under the mass of whitewash which covers its
walls—in the narthex they can still be distinguished.The existing church is nearly square in plan, being 109 ft.by 92 over
all, exclusive of the apse, and covering only about 10,000 sq.It
has consequently no pretensions to magnificence on the score of
dimensions, but is singularly elegant in design and proportion.Internally, the arrangement of the piers of the dome, of the galleries,
and of the pillars which support them, are almost identical with those
of St.Vitale at Ravenna, but the proportions of the Eastern example are
better, being 66 ft.in height by 52 in diameter, while the other, with
the same diameter, is nearly 20 ft.higher, and consequently too tall to
be pleasing.The details of this church are generally well designed for the purposes
to which they are applied.There is a certain reminiscence of classical
feeling in the mouldings and foliage—in the latter, however, very faint.313) here seems almost to have superseded the
capital, and what was once a classical entablature has retained very
little of its pristine form (No.314), and indeed was used
constructively only, for the support of a gallery, or some such
mechanical requirement.The arch had entirely superseded it as an
ornamental feature long before the age of Justinian.Although the building just described, and others that might be quoted,
probably contain the germs of all that is found in Sta.Sophia, they are
on so small a scale that it is startling to find Justinian attempting an
edifice so grand, and so daring in construction, without more experience
than he appears to have obtained.Indeed so exceptional does this great
structure appear, with our present knowledge, that we might almost feel
inclined at first sight to look upon it as the immediate creation of the
individual genius of its architect, Anthemius of Thralles; but there can
be little doubt that if a greater number of contemporary examples
existed we should be able to trace back every feature of the design to
its origin.The scale, however, on which it was carried out was
certainly original, and required great boldness on the part of the
architect to venture upon such a piece of magnificence.At all events,
the celebrated boast of its founder on contemplating his finished work
was more than justified.When Justinian exclaimed, “I have surpassed
thee, O Solomon,” he took an exaggerated view of the work of his
predecessor, and did not realize the extent to which his building
excelled the Jewish temple.The latter was only equal to a small church
with a wooden roof supported by wooden posts, and covering some 7200 sq.Sophia covers ten times that area, is built of durable
materials throughout, and far more artistically ornamented than the
temple of the Jews ever could have been.But Justinian did more than
accomplish this easy victory.Neither the Pantheon nor any of the
vaulted halls at Rome equal the nave of Sta.Sophia in extent, or in
cleverness of construction, or in beauty of design.Nor was there
anything erected during the ten centuries which elapsed from the
transference of the capital to Byzantium till the building of the great
mediæval cathedrals which can be compared with it.Indeed it remains
even now an open question whether a Christian church exists anywhere, of
any age, whose interior is so beautiful as that of this marvellous
creation of old Byzantine art.Sophia which had been erected by Constantine
was, it seems, burnt to the ground in the fifth year of Justinian, A.D.532, when he determined to re-erect it on the same spot with more
magnificence and with less combustible materials.So rapidly were the
works pushed forward, that in six years it was ready for dedication,
A.D.Twenty years afterwards a portion of the dome fell down in
consequence of an earthquake; but this damage was repaired, and the
church re-dedicated, A.D.563, in the form, probably very nearly, in
which we now find it.In plan it closely approaches an exact square, being 235 ft.north and
south by 250 east and west, exclusive of the narthex and apse.The
narthex itself is a splendid hall, 205 ft.Beyond this there is an exo-narthex
which runs round the whole of the outer court, but this hardly seems to
be part of the original design.Altogether, the building, without this
or any adjuncts which may be after-thoughts, covers about 70,000 sq.ft., or nearly the average area of a mediæval cathedral of the first
class.316) possesses little architectural
beauty beyond what is due to its mass and the varied outline arising
from the mechanical contrivances necessary to resist the thrust of its
internal construction.It may be that, like the early Christian
basilicas at Rome, it was purposely left plain to distinguish it from
the external adornment of Heathen temples, or it may have been intended
to revêt it with marble, and add the external ornament afterwards.Before we became acquainted with the ornamental exteriors of Syrian
churches, the former theory would seem the more plausible, though it can
hardly now be sustained; and when we consider that the second dedication
only took place the year before Justinian’s death, and how soon
troublous times followed, we may fairly assume that what we now see is
only an incomplete design.Whatever may be the case with the exterior,
all the internal arrangements are complete, and perfect both from a
mechanical and an artistic point of view.In such a design as this, the
first requirement was to obtain four perfectly stable arches on which
the dome might rest.The great difficulty was with the two arches
running transversely north and south.These are as nearly as may be 100
ft.span and 120 high to the crown, and 10 ft.Each of them
has a mass of masonry behind it for an abutment, 75 ft.wide, only partially pierced by arches on the ground and gallery floor;
and as the mass might have been carried to any height, it ought, if
properly constructed, to have sufficed for an arch very much wider and
more heavily weighted than that which it supports.Yet the southern wall
is considerably bulged, and the whole of that side thrown out of the
perpendicular.This probably was the effect of the earthquake which
caused the fall of the dome in 559, since no further settlement seems to
have taken place.The
distance between the solid parts of the piers was 75 ft., and this was
filled up with a screen wall supporting the inner side of the arch; so,
unless that was crushed, the whole was perfectly stable.Pendentives
between these four arches ought not to have presented any difficulties.It would, however, have been better, from an architectural point of
view, if they had been carried further up and forward, so as to hang a
weight inside the dome to counteract the outward thrust, as was
afterwards so successfully practised at Beejapore.[227] As it is, the
dome rests rather on the outer edge of the system, without sufficient
space for abutment.In itself the dome is very little lower than a
hemisphere, being 107 ft.Externally, it
would have been better if higher; for internal effect this is
sufficient.Its base is pierced by forty small windows, so small and so
low as not to interfere in any way with the apparent construction, but
affording an ample supply of light—in that climate at least—to render
every part of the dome bright and cheerful.Sophia from E. to W. Scale 100 ft.Beyond the great dome, east and west, are two semi-domes of a diameter
equal to that of the great dome, and these are again cut into by two
smaller domes, so that the building, instead of being a Greek cross, as
usually asserted, is only 100 ft.across in the centre and 125 wide
beyond the central space each way.There is a little awkwardness in the
way in which the smaller semi-domes cut into the larger, and the three
windows of the latter are unconnected with any other part of the design,
which is unpleasing, but might easily be remedied in a second attempt.These very irregularities, however, give a variety and appropriateness
to the design which has probably never been surpassed.A single dome of
the area of the central and two semi-domes would not have appeared
nearly so large, and would have overpowered everything else in the
building.As it is, the eye wanders upwards from the large arcades of
the ground floor to the smaller arches of the galleries, and thence to
the smaller semi-domes.These lead the eye on to the larger, and the
whole culminates in the great central roof.Nothing, probably, so
artistic has been done on the same scale before or since.If, however, the proportions of this church are admirable, the details
are equally so.All the pillars are of porphyry, verd antique, or
marbles of the most precious kinds.The capitals are among the most
admirable specimens of the style.It will be remembered that the
governing line of a classical Corinthian capital is a hollow curve, to
which acanthus-leaves or other projecting ornaments were applied.When
the columns were close together, and had only a beam to support, this
form of capital was sufficient; but when employed to carry the
constructive arches of the fabric its weakness became instantly
apparent.Long before Justinian’s time, the tendency became apparent to
reverse the curve and to incise the ornament.Sophia the
transition is complete; the capitals are as full as elegance would
allow, and all the surfaces are flat, with ornaments relieved by
incision.In the lower tier of arches (Woodcut No.318) this is boldly
and beautifully done, the marble being left to tell its own story.In
the upper tier, further removed from the eye, the interstices are filled
in with black marble so as to ensure the desired effect.All the flat surfaces are covered with a mosaic of marble slabs of the
most varied patterns and beautiful colours; the domes, roofs, and curved
surfaces, with a gold-grounded mosaic relieved by figures or
architectural devices.Though much of the mosaic is now concealed,
enough is left to enable the effect of the whole to be judged of, and it
certainly is wonderfully grand and pleasing.The one thing wanting is
painted glass, like that which adorns the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem,
to render this building as solemnly impressive as it is overpoweringly
beautiful.Sophia is so essentially different from the greater number of
churches, that it is extremely difficult to institute a comparison
between them.With regard to external effect, Gothic cathedrals
generally excel it; but whether by accident or by the inherent necessity
of the style is by no means so clear.In so far as the interior is
concerned, no Gothic architect ever rose to the conception of a hall 100
ft.high, and none ever disposed
each part more artistically to obtain the effect he desired to produce.Where the Byzantine style might profit from the experience subsequently
gained by Gothic architects is in the use of mouldings.The one defect
in the decoration of Sta.Sophia is that it depends too much on colour.It would have been better if the pier-arches, the window-frames, and the
string-courses generally had been more strongly accentuated by moulding
and panellings, but this is a slight defect among so many beauties.A comparison with the great Renaissance cathedrals is more easy, but
results even more favourably to the Byzantine example.Two of these have
domes which are considerably larger—St.Paul’s, London (108), is within a
foot of the same diameter, all the rest are smaller.[228] This, however,
is of less consequence than the fact that they are all adjuncts to the
design of the church.None of them are integral or supported by the rest
of the design, and all tend to dwarf the buildings they are attached to
rather than to heighten the general effect.With scarcely an exception
also all the Renaissance cathedrals employ internally great sprawling
pillars and pilasters, designed for external use by the Romans, which
not only diminish the apparent size of the building but produce an
effect of unreality and sham utterly fatal to true art.In fact, turn it as we will, and compare it as we may with any other
buildings of its class, the verdict seems inevitable that Sta.Sophia—internally at least, for we may omit the consideration of the
exterior, as unfinished—is the most perfect and most beautiful church
which has yet been erected by any Christian people.When its furniture
was complete the verdict would probably have been still more strongly in
its favour; but so few of the buildings described in these pages retain
these adjuncts in anything like completeness that they must be withdrawn
from both sides and our remarks be confined to the architecture, and
that only.Sophia at Thessalonica, according to Greek tradition,
was built by Justinian in the latter part of his reign.[229] It is a
church of considerable dimensions, measuring 140 ft.It possesses also an
upper gallery, and its arrangements generally are well considered and
artistic.There does not seem to be any documentary evidence of its age,
but judging from the details published in Texier, the date ascribed to
it seems probable.This has been further established lately from an
inscription found in the apse, which as well as the dome still retain
their ancient mosaics; the inscription is incomplete, but Messrs.Duchesne and Bayet, in an appendix to their work on Mount Athos, ascribe
it to the second half of the 6th century.The church possesses one
special characteristic: above the pendentives is a low drum, circular
internally,[230] in which windows are pierced, but which, externally, is
carried up square: by this means the angle piers are well weighted and
are thus enabled to resist more effectually the thrust of the arches
carrying the pendentives.The two side walls also, which in Sta.Sophia
at Constantinople were built almost flush with the inner arch, leaving
outside a widely-projecting arch thrown across between the buttresses to
carry the buttresses of the dome, are here placed flush with the outside
of the arch, thus giving increased space to the interior.The publication of the Count De Vogüé’s book has enabled us to realise
the civil and domestic architecture of Syria in the 5th and 6th
centuries with a completeness that, a very short time ago, would have
been thought impossible.Owing to the fact that every part of the
buildings in the Hauran was in stone, and that they were suddenly
deserted on the Mahomedan conquest, never, apparently, to be
re-occupied, many of the houses remain perfectly entire to the present
day, and in Northern Syria only the roofs are gone.Generally they seem to have been two storeys in height, adorned with
verandahs supported by stone columns, the upper having a solid
screen-fence of stone about 3 ft.high, intended apparently as
much to secure privacy to the sleeping apartments of the house as
protection against falling out.In some instances the lower storey is
twice the height of the upper, and contained the state apartments of the
house.In others, as in that at Refadi (Woodcut No.320), it seems to
have been intended for the offices.In the plan of a house at Moudjeleia
(Woodcut No.321) the principal block of the house is in two storeys,
with portico on ground floor and verandah over.The buildings at the
back with their courtyard were probably offices, and those in front by
the side of the main entrance warehouses or stores.In some instances one is startled to find details which we are
accustomed to associate with much more modern dates; as, for instance,
this window (Woodcut No.322) from the palace at Chaqqa, which there
seems no reason whatever for doubting belongs to the 3rd
century—anterior to the time of Constantine!It looks more like the
vagary of a French architect of the age of Francis I.Plan of house at Moudjeleia.]The building known as the Golden Gateway at Jerusalem and attributed to
Justinian, bears in its details many striking resemblances to those of
the 5th and 6th centuries in Central Syria, illustrated in De Vogüé’s
book.It is situated on the east side of the Haram enclosure, and
consists of a vestibule divided by columns into two aisles of three bays
each vaulted with a cupola[231] carried on arches, between which and the
capitals of the columns is found the Byzantine dosseret already referred
to.Within the eastern doorways (said to have been blocked up by Omar)
are two huge monoliths 14 ft.respectively, the
doorposts of an earlier gateway.Externally, on the entrance fronts
(east and west), the entablature of the pilasters is carried round the
circular-headed doorways which they flank; the earliest instance of this
development is found in the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato, and there
is a second example in the Roman gateway to the Mosque of Damascus,
which probably suggested the idea to the Byzantine builders; the sharp
stiff foliage of Greek type with which the ornament is carved on the
Golden Gate agrees in style and character with that in the church of St.Demetrius at Thessalonica dating from the commencement of the 6th
century.(From a Drawing by
Catherwood.Originally published in Fisher’s ‘Oriental Album.’)]

Of similar style and character are the arch-moulds of the double gate on
the south wall of the Haram, and the cupolas of the interior vestibule,
the columns carrying them however being probably of earlier date and
possibly part of the substructure of Herod’s temple.The surface
decoration of these cupolas is similar to that found in Central Syria.The sepulchral remains of Syria, both structural and rock-cut, seem
nearly as numerous as the dwellings of the living, and are full of
interest, not only from their frequently bearing dates, but from their
presenting new types of tombs, or old types in such new forms as
scarcely to be recognizable.Roof of one of the Compartments of the Gate Huldah.The oldest example, that of Hamrath in Souideh, dates from the 1st
century B.C., and consists of a tomb 28 ft.square decorated with
semi-detached Doric columns; the roof is gone, but it was probably
covered with one of pyramidal form like the tomb of Zechariah (Woodcut
No.The tomb of Diogenes at Hass (Woodcut No.326), also square, consisted
of two storeys, with a portico on the ground storey on one side, and a
peristyle on all four sides of the upper storey, above which rose the
central walls carrying a pyramidal roof, not stepped, as in the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, but with projecting bosses on each stone.The same class of roof is found on other tombs, being adopted probably
as the simplest method of covering over the tomb; these tombs date from
the 4th and 5th centuries, and in all cases the sepulchral chambers
within them are vaulted with large slabs of stone carried on stone ribs.Tomb at Hass]

Besides these, there is another class of tomb apparently very numerous,
in which the sepulchral chamber is below the ground, with vaulted
entrance rising to form a podium on which columns either two or four in
number are erected;[232] in the latter case the columns bearing an
entablature with small pyramidal roof; in the former a fragment of
architrave only, the two columns being sometimes tied together one-third
of the way down by a stone band with dentils carved on it: these tombs
are, many of them, dated, and belong to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.With our present limits it is only possible to characterize generally
the main features of the Byzantine style, and to indicate the sources
from which further information may be obtained.In the present instance
it is satisfactory to find that ample materials now exist for filling up
a framework which a few years ago was almost entirely a blank.Any one
who will master the works of De Vogüé, or Texier, or Salzenberg, and
other minor publications, may easily acquire a fair knowledge of the
older Byzantine style of architecture.Once it is grasped it will
probably be acknowledged that there are few more interesting chapters
than that which explains how a perfect Christian Church like that of
Sta.Sophia was elaborated out of the classical edifices of ancient
Rome.It will also probably be found that there are few more instructive
lessons to be learnt from the study of architectural history than the
tracing of the various contrivances which were so earnestly employed,
during the first two centuries of Christian supremacy, in attaining this
result.NEO-BYZANTINE STYLE.Irene, Constantinople—Churches at Ancyra, Trabala, and
  Constantinople—Churches at Thessalonica and in Greece—Domestic
  Architecture.Santa Sophia at Constantinople was not only the grandest and most
perfect creation of the old school of Byzantine art, but it was also the
last.It seems as if the creative power of the Empire had exhausted
itself in that great effort, and for long after it the history is a
blank.We always knew that the two centuries which elapsed between the
ages of Constantine and Justinian were ages of great architectural
activity.We knew that hundreds, it may be thousands, of churches were
erected during that period.With the two subsequent centuries, however,
the case seems widely different.Shortly after Justinian’s death, the
troubles of the Empire, the Persian wars of Heraclius, and, more than
either, the rise of the Mahomedan power in the East, and of the Roman
pontificate under Gregory the Great in the West—all tended so to disturb
and depress the Byzantine kingdom as to leave little leisure and less
means for the exercise of architectural magnificence.It is therefore
hardly probable that we shall ever be in a position to illustrate the
7th and 8th centuries as we now know we can the 5th and 6th.Still,
building must have gone on, because when we again meet the style, it is
changed.One of the very earliest churches of the new school is that of
Sta.Irene at Constantinople, rebuilt as we now find it by Leo the
Isaurian (A.D.It differs in several essential particulars
from the old style, and contains the germ of much that we find
frequently repeated.The change is not so great as might have taken
place in two centuries of building activity, but it is considerable.In
this church we find, apparently for the first time in a complete form,
the new mode of introducing the light to the dome through a
perpendicular drum, which afterwards became so universal that it serves
to fix the age of a building in the East with almost as much certainty
as the presence of a pointed arch does that of a building in the West.As this invention is so important, it may be well to recapitulate the
steps by which it was arrived at.Half Section, half Elevation, of Dome of Sta.The oldest mode of lighting a dome is practised in the Pantheon (Woodcut
No.191), by simply leaving out the central portion.Artistically and
mechanically nothing could be better, but before the invention of glass
it was intolerably inconvenient whenever much rain or snow fell.A
change therefore was necessary, and it is found in the tomb or temple of
Marcellus, built during the reign of Constantine on the Via Prenestina
at Rome.It consists simply of boring four circular holes through the
dome a little above its springing.The next step is seen at Thessalonica
in the church of St.There eight semi-circular
lunettes are pierced in the dome, at its springing, and answer the
purpose very perfectly.Sophia, where
forty windows introduce a flood of light without its ever falling on the
eyes of the spectator.After this it seems to have been considered
desirable not to break the hemisphere of the dome, but to place the
windows in a perpendicular circular rim of masonry—called the drum—and
to introduce the light always through that.Externally there can be no
doubt but that this was an improvement; it gave height and dignity to
the dome in small churches, where, without this elevation, the feature
would have been lost.Internally, however, the advantage is
problematical: the separation of the dome from its pendentives destroyed
the continuity of the roof, and introduced the stilted effect so
objectionable in Renaissance domes.In the Neo-Byzantine churches the
dome became practically a skylight on the roof, the drum increasing in
height and the dome diminishing in dignity as the style progressed.As
all the churches are small, the feature is unobjectionable; but in
larger edifices it would have been found difficult to construct it, and
the artistic result would hardly have been pleasing, even had this
difficulty been got over.Be this as it may, its value as a chronometric
landmark is undoubted.As a rule it may generally be asserted that, in all Christian domes
erected during the old Byzantine period, the light is introduced by
openings in the dome itself.[233] After that time, the light is as
generally admitted through windows in the drum, the dome itself being
cut into only in the rarest possible instances.If these views are correct, the church of St.Clement at Ancyra is a
transitional specimen subsequent to Sta.Sophia, because the dome is
raised timidly (Woodcut No.328) on a low drum pierced with four small
windows; but it is anterior to Sta.Irene, because the dome is still
pierced with twelve larger windows, after the manner of Sta.All the details of its architecture, in so far as
they can be made out, bear out this description.They are further
removed from the classical type than the churches of Justinian, and the
whole plan (Woodcut No.329) is more that which the Greek church
afterwards took than any of the early churches show.Its greatest
defect—though the one most generally inherent in the style—is in its
dimensions.long, over all externally, by 58 ft.Yet this is a fair average size of a Greek church of that age.Another church, very similar, is found at Myra, dedicated to St.Clement in size, and has a double
narthex considerably larger in proportion, but so ruined that it is
difficult to make out its plan, or to ascertain whether it is a part of
the original structure, or a subsequent addition.The cupola is raised
on a drum, and altogether the church has the appearance of being much
more modern than that at Ancyra.A third church of the same class, and better preserved, is found at
Trabala in Lycia.Clement, and similar in
its arrangements to Sta.Sophia, except in the omission of the
semi-domes, which seem never to have been adopted in the provinces,[234]
and indeed may be said to be peculiar to the metropolitan church.Notwithstanding the beauty of that feature, it appears to have remained
dormant till revived by the Turks in Constantinople, and there alone.In this example there are two detached octagonal buildings, either tombs
or sacristies; a form which, except in large detached buildings, does
not seem to have been so common as the circular, till after the time of
Justinian.Returning to the capital, we find one other remarkable peculiarity of
the Neo-Byzantine style in the attempt to allow the external surface of
an ordinary tunnel-vault to retain its form without any ridge whatever.It can hardly be doubted that this is artistically a mistake.With domes
it was early felt to be so, and consequently we always find a flower or
pinnacle in iron, or some such ornament, marking the centre.In this the
Saracenic architects were especially successful—all their domes possess
a central ornament sufficient to relieve them, and generally of the most
beautiful proportions.With the extrados of a circular vault, however,
it is even worse than with a dome.A roof is felt to be a contrivance to
keep off the rain.It may be more or less sloping, according to the
materials of which it is constructed; but to make one part of each ridge
sloping, and the central portion flat, is a discord that offends the
eye, besides looking weak and unmeaning.A pointed arch would avoid the
evil, but a reverse or ogee curve is perhaps the most pleasing.In the
Neo-Byzantine age, however, between the 8th and the 12th centuries, the
eye seems to have got accustomed to it.It is common in the East,
especially at Constantinople and at Venice.Mark’s and elsewhere
it became so familiar a form that it was copied and continued by the
Renaissance architects even to the end of the 16th century.One of the best illustrations of these peculiarities is the church of
Moné tés Choras at Constantinople, now converted into a mosque and
called Kahriyeh Djamisi.The older part of it seems to belong to the
11th century, the side-aisles to the 12th, and though small, it
illustrates the style perfectly.The porch consists of five arches
covered with an intersecting vault, visible both externally and
internally.The last two bays are covered with cupolas which still
retain their mosaics internally, and those of singular beauty and
brilliancy, though, owing to the constructive defects of the
intermediate parts, the wet has leaked through, and the mosaics have
mostly peeled off.Externally the front is ornamented with courses of
stones alternating with two or three layers of tiles, and even in its
ruined state is effective and picturesque.Its principal interest is
that it shows what was the matrix[235] of the contemporary church of St.Subsequent additions have much modified the external
appearance of St.Mark, but there can be very little doubt that
originally it was intended to be very like the façade shown in Woodcut
No.Not far from Moné tés Choras there are two other churches of the same
class and of about the same age.One, the Pantokrator, has been added to
at various times so as to cover a large space of ground, but it consists
consequently of small and ill-assorted parts.It retains, however, a
good deal of its marble pavements and other features of interest.The
other, known as the Fethîyeh Djamisi, is smaller and more complete, and
possesses some mosaics of considerable beauty.Elevation of Church of the Theotokos.(From Lenoir,
‘Architecture Monastique.’) Enlarged scale.]The best example of its class, however, in Constantinople is that known
as the Theotokos.Like those just mentioned it is very small, the church
itself being only 37 ft.by 45, and, though its double narthex and
lateral adjuncts add considerably to its dimensions, it is still only a
very small church.Some parts of it are as old as the 9th or 10th
century, but the façade represented in Woodcut No.333 is certainly not
older than the 12th century.Taking it altogether, it is perhaps the
most complete and elegant church of its class now known to exist in or
near the capital, and many of its details are of great beauty and
perfection.It seems scarcely possible to suppose that the meagre half-dozen of
small churches just enumerated are all that were erected in the capital
between the death of Justinian and the fall of the city.Yet there is no
evidence that the Turks destroyed any.They converted
them into mosques, finding them especially convenient for that purpose,
and they have maintained them with singularly little alteration to the
present day.This deficiency of examples in the capital is to some extent supplied by
those which are found existing at Thessalonica.Three churches belonging
to this age are illustrated in Texier and Pullan’s work.Apse of Church of the Apostles, Thessalonica.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]The first of these is the church of Kazandjita Djami, dedicated to the
Mother of God, a small church measuring only 53 ft.by 37, exclusive of
the apse.Its date is perfectly ascertained—viz., 1028.Next to these comes the church of Elias, A.D.1054, and very similar to
it in style is that of the Apostles (Woodcut No.334), which we may
consequently date with safety in the 11th century, from this
juxtaposition alone, though there are several other examples which
enable us to treat it as a characteristic type of the age.It is a
pleasing and picturesque specimen of Byzantine brickwork.Like all the
churches of the time, it is small, 63 ft.In plan it
very much resembles the Theotokos at Constantinople, but in elevation is
taller and thinner; though whether this arises from any local
peculiarity, or from some difference of age, is not clear.The earthquakes of the capital may have induced a less ambitious
form, as far as height is concerned, than was adopted in the provinces.There can be little doubt but that, if a systematic search were made
among the churches of Greece, many would be brought to light which would
be most useful in completing our knowledge of the Neo-Byzantine
style.[236] At Mount Athos there exists from twenty to thirty
monasteries, each with its Catholicon or principal church and other
chapels.Many of these are of ancient date, ranging between the 10th and
16th centuries, and although some of them may have been restored, in
some cases rebuilt in later times, they have not yet been examined or
illustrated by any competent architect.Brockhaus in his work[237] gives
the plan of three churches, one of which, the Catholicon (dated 1043) of
the Dochiariu Monastery (Woodcut No.335), is further illustrated by a
bird’s-eye view taken from a photograph.The domes and drums over the
narthex and two eastern chapels would seem to be later additions, made
either in consequence of the proximity of the buildings of the monastery
which obscured the light obtainable from windows, or to show better the
wall frescoes, which in the case of the narthex, where no windows ever
existed, must have been quite dark at first.The oldest church (963
A.D.)apparently is that of the Protaton at Caryas, which consists of a
short nave, a transept, and a long choir, and is wanting in that one
feature which is supposed to be characteristic of a Byzantine church,
viz., a dome; the whole building is covered like a basilica with a flat
wooden roof, beneath which are clerestory windows.Photogravures or
woodcuts are given of the churches of Chilandari (1197 A.D.), Xeropotamu
(1028-34 A.D.), the Laura (963 A.D., but rebuilt under Turkish rule),
and woodcuts from photographs in an interesting description of the
Monasteries by Mr.A. Riley,[238] give a good general idea of the work
to be found in Athos, from which it would seem that the chief interest
centres in the sumptuous carvings of the icon and stalls,[239] and in
the frescoes with which most of the interiors of the churches are
painted.For Greece proper we are dependent almost wholly on Couchaud[240] and
Blouet.[241] So far as the illustrations go they suggest that there are
no churches of such dimensions as would ensure dignity, nor are any so
beautiful in outline or detail as to make us regret much that we do not
know more about them.Still they are sufficiently original to be worthy
of study, and when properly known may help to join together some of the
scattered links of the chain which once connected the architecture of
the West and East, but which is at present so difficult to follow out.In Athens there are several churches of considerable interest, and not
without architectural pretension.The
largest is that known as Panagia Lycodemo, or the church of St.Nicodemus, and is only 62 ft.It seems
also to be the oldest, since its dome is partially pierced with windows
inside, though outside there is a distinctly marked drum (Woodcut No.Notwithstanding the smallness of its dimensions, considerable
effect is obtained internally by the judicious arrangement of the parts
and the harmony of proportion which reigns throughout.The exterior is
also pleasing, though the loss of the cornice gives an unfinished look
to the whole, and there is a want of sufficient connection between the
dome and the walls of the building to make them part of one composition.A more beautiful and more interesting example is the church known as the
Catholicon or Cathedral at Athens (Woodcut No.It is a cathedral,
however, only in a Greek sense, certainly not as understood in the Latin
Church, for its dimensions are only 40 ft.It
is almost impossible to judge of its age from its details, since they
are partly borrowed from older classical buildings, or imitations of
classical forms, so fashioned as to harmonize with parts which are old.But the tallness of its dome, the form of its windows, and the internal
arrangements, all point to a very modern date for its erection—as
probably the 13th century as the 11th or 12th.The church of the Virgin at Mistra in the Peloponnesus was built in the
13th century on a hillside overlooking the plain of Sparta, and partly
with materials taken from the remains of the ancient city; but though it
belongs possibly to the same age as the Catholicon at Athens, it differs
considerably from it in style, and bears much more resemblance to the
churches of Apulia and Sicily than either of those described above.(From Couchaud, ‘Églises
Byzantines en Grèce.’) Enlarged scale.]Where arcades are used externally in these Greek churches, they are
generally supported by pillars of somewhat classical look (often old
classic columns and capitals were used up), crowned by capitals of the
square foliaged form, employed to support arches in the early styles all
over Europe; and the windows, when divided, take merely the form of
diminutive arcades.The Byzantines never attained to tracery; all their
early windows are single round-headed openings.These were afterwards
grouped together in threes and fives; and, as in the Gothic style, when
they could be put under one discharging arch, the piers were attenuated
till they became almost mullions, but always supporting constructive
arches, without any tendency to run into interlacing forms like the
Gothic.The universal employment of mural painting in Byzantine
churches, and the consequent exclusion of painted glass, rendered the
use of the large windows which the Gothic architects employed quite
inadmissible; and in such a climate very much smaller openings sufficed
to admit all the light that was required.Tracery would thus, in fact,
have been an absurdity, and the windows were often filled in with
transparent marble slabs pierced with holes, which were either glazed or
occasionally even left open.The Byzantine architects sought to ornament
their windows externally by the employment of tiles or colours disposed
in various patterns, and often produced a very pleasing effect, as may
be seen from the woodcut (No.337) illustrating the apse of the Panagia
Lycodemo at Athens, in the Hebdomon Palace (Woodcut No.342), and other
specimens already quoted.Occasionally we find in these churches projecting porches or balconies,
and machicolations, which give great relief to the general flatness of
the walls.These features are all marked with that elegance peculiar to
the East, and more especially to a people claiming descent from the
ancient Greeks, and possibly having some of their blood in their veins.Sometimes, too, even a subordinate apse is supported on a bracket-like
balcony, so as to form a very pleasing object, as in the accompanying
specimen from Mistra.On the whole the Neo-Byzantine style may be said to be characterised by
considerable elegance, with occasional combinations of a superior order;
but after the time of Justinian the country was too deficient in unity
or science to attempt anything great or good, and too poor to aspire to
grandeur, so that it has no claim to rank among the great styles of the
earth.[242] The old Byzantine style was elevated to a first-class
position through the buildings of Justinian; but from his time the
history of the art is a history of decline, like that of the Eastern
Empire itself and of Greece, down to the final extinction both of the
Empire and the style, under the successive conquests by the Venetians
and the Turks.The only special claim which the Neo-Byzantine style
makes upon our sympathies or attention is that of being the direct
descendant of Greek and Roman art.As such, it forms a connecting link
between the past and present which must not be overlooked, while in
itself it has sufficient merit to reward the student who shall apply
himself to its elucidation.Palace of the Hebdomon, Constantinople.]It is more than probable that very considerable remains of the civil or
domestic architecture of the Neo-Byzantine period may still be
recovered.Most of their palaces or public buildings have continued to
be occupied by their successors, but the habits of Turkish life are
singularly opposed to the prying of the archæologist.Almost the only
building which has been brought to light and illustrated is the palace
of the Hebdomon at Blachernæ in Constantinople, built by Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (913-949).All that remains of it, however, is a block
of buildings 80 ft.by 40 in plan, forming one end of a courtyard; those
at the other end, which were more extensive, being too much ruined to be
restored.The parts that remain probably belong to the 9th century, and
consist of two halls, one over the other, the lower supported by pillars
carrying vaults, the upper free.The façade towards the court (Woodcut
342) is of considerable elegance, being adorned by a mosaic of bricks of
various colours disposed in graceful patterns, and forming an
architectural decoration which, if not of the highest class, is very
appropriate for domestic architecture.One great cause of the deficiency of examples may be the combustibility
of the capital.They may have been destroyed in the various fires, and
outside Constantinople the number of large cities and their wealth and
importance was gradually decreasing till the capital itself sunk into
the power of the Turks in the year 1453.CHAPTER V.

The architectural province of Armenia forms an almost exact pendant to
that of Greece in the history of Byzantine architecture.Both were early
converted to Christianity, and Greece remained Christian without any
interruption from that time to this.Yet all her earlier churches have
perished, we hardly know why, and left us nothing but an essentially
Mediæval style.Nearly the same thing happened in Armenia, but there the
loss is only too easily accounted for.The Persian persecution in the
5th and 6th centuries must have been severe and lasting, and the great
_bouleversement_ of the Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century would
easily account for the disappearance of all the earlier monuments.When,
in more tranquil times—in the 8th and 9th centuries—the Christians were
permitted to rebuild their churches, we find them all of the same small
type as those of Greece, with tall domes, painted with frescoes
internally, and depending for external effect far more on minute
elaboration of details than on any grandeur of design or proportion.Although the troubles and persecutions from the 5th to the 8th century
may have caused the destruction of the greater part of the monuments, it
by no means follows that all have perished.On the contrary, we know of
the church above alluded to (p.428) as still existing at Nisibin and
belonging to the 4th century, and there can be little doubt that many
others exist in various corners of the land; but they have hardly yet
been looked for, at least not by anyone competent to discriminate
between what was really old and what may have belonged to some
subsequent rebuilding or repair.Till this more careful examination of the province shall have been
accomplished, our history of the style cannot be carried back beyond the
Hejira.Even then very great difficulty exists in arranging the
materials, and in assigning correct dates to the various examples.In
the works of Texier,[243] Dubois,[244] Brosset,[245] and Grimm[246] some
forty or fifty churches are described and figured in more or less
detail, but in most cases the dates assigned to them are derived from
written testimony only, the authors not having sufficient knowledge of
the style to be able to check the very fallacious evidence of the
_litera scripta_.In consequence of this, the dates usually given are
those of the building of the first church on the spot, whereas, in a
country so troubled by persecution as Armenia, the original church may
have been rebuilt several times, and what we now see is often very
modern indeed.Among the churches now existing in Armenia, the oldest seems to be that
in the village of Dighour near Ani.There are neither traditions nor
inscriptions to assist in fixing its date; but, from the simplicity of
its form and its quasi-classical details, it is evidently older than any
other known examples, and with the aid of the information conveyed in De
Vogüé’s recent publications we can have little hesitation in assigning
it to the 7th century.[247] The church is not large, being only 95 ft.Internally its design is characterised by
extreme solidity and simplicity, and all the details are singularly
classical in outline.The dome is an ellipse, timidly constructed, with
far more than the requisite amount of abutment.One of its most marked
peculiarities is the existence of two external niches placed in
projecting wings and which were no doubt intended to receive altars.Its
flanks are ornamented by three-quarter columns of debased classical
design.These support an architrave which is bent over the heads of the
windows as in the churches of Northern Syria erected during the 6th
century.Its western and lateral doorways are ornamented by horse-shoe arches,
which are worth remarking here, as it is a feature which the Saracenic
architects used so currently and employed for almost every class of
opening.The oldest example of this form known is in the doorway of the
building called Takt-i-Gero on Mount Zagros.[248] In this little shrine,
all the other details are so purely and essentially classic that the
building must be dated before or about the time of Constantine.The
horse-shoe arch again occurs in the church at Dana on the Euphrates in
540.[249] At Dighour we find it used, not in construction but as an
ornamental feature.The stilting of the arch was evidently one of those
experiments which the architects of that time were making in order to
free themselves from the trammels of the Roman semi-circular arch.The
Saracens carried it much further and used it with marked success, but
this is probably the last occasion in which it was employed by a
Christian architect as a decorative expedient.The six buttresses, with their offsets, which adorn the façade, are
another curious feature in the archæology of this church.If they are
integral parts of the original design, which there seems no reason to
doubt, they anticipate by several centuries the appearance of this form
in Western Europe.West Elevation of Church at Usunlar.One of the oldest and least altered of the Armenian churches seems to be
that of Usunlar, said to have been erected by the Catholicos Jean IV.In plan it looks like a peristylar
temple, but the verandahs which surround it are only low arcades, and
have very little affinity with classical forms.These are carried round
the front, but there pierced only by the doorway.The elevation, as here
exhibited, is simple, but sufficiently expresses the internal
arrangements, and, with an octagonal dome, forms, when seen in
perspective, a pleasing object from every point of view.Both plan and
design are, however, exceptional in the province.A far more usual
arrangement is that found at Pitzounda in Abkassia, which may be
considered as the typical form of an Armenian church.It is said to have
been erected by the Emperor Justinian, and there is nothing in the style
or ornamentation of the lower part that seems to gainsay its being his.But the plan is so like many that belong to a much later age, that we
must hesitate before we can feel sure that it has not been rebuilt at
some more modern date.Its cupola certainly belongs to a period long
after the erection of Sta.327),
when the dome pierced with tall windows had become the fashionable form
of dome in the Byzantine school.Its interior, also, is unusually tall,
and the pointed arches under the dome look like integral parts of the
design, and when so employed belong certainly to a much more modern
date.On the whole, therefore, it seems that this church, as we now see
it, may have been rebuilt in the 9th or 10th century.Whatever its date, it is a pleasing example of the style.Externally it
is devoid of ornament except what is obtained by the insertion of tiles
between the courses of the stone, and a similar relief to the windows;
but even this little introduction of colour gives it a gay and cheerful
appearance, more than could easily be obtained by mouldings or carving
in stone.The upper galleries of the nave and the chapels of the choir are also
well expressed in the external design, and altogether, for a small
church—which it is (only 137 ft.by 75)—it is as pleasing a composition
as could easily be found.The idea that the date of this church is considerably more modern than
Dubois and others are inclined to assign to it, is confirmed by a
comparison of its plan with that at Bedochwinta, which Brosset
determines from inscriptions to belong to the date 1556-1575; and the
knowledge lately acquired tends strongly to the conviction that this
plan of church belongs to a later period in the Middle Ages, though it
is difficult to determine when it was introduced, and it may be only a
continuation of a much earlier form.One other church of this part of the world seems to claim especial
mention, that of Mokwi, built in the 10th century, and painted as we
learn from inscriptions, between 1080 and 1125.It is a large and
handsome church, but its principal interest lies in the fact that in
dimensions and arrangement it is almost identical with the
contemporaneous church of Sta.Sophia at Novogorod, showing a connection
between the two countries which will be more particularly pointed out
hereafter.It is now very much ruined, and covered with a veil of
creepers which prevents its outward form from being easily
distinguished.[250]]

As will be perceived, its plan is only an extension of the two last
mentioned, having five aisles instead of three; but it is smaller in
scale and more timid in execution.The church which it most resembles is
that at Trabala in Syria (Woodcut No.330), which is certainly of an
earlier date than any we are acquainted with further east.Practically
the same plan occurs at Athens (Woodcut No.338), and at Mistra (Woodcut
No.339), but these seem on a smaller scale than at Mokwi, so that it
may be considered as the typical form of a Neo-Byzantine church for four
or five centuries, and it would consequently be unsafe to attempt to fix
a date from its peculiarities.Plan of Church at Etchmiasdin.Interesting as these may be in an historical point of view, the most
important ecclesiastical establishment in this part of the world is that
of Etchmiasdin.Here are four churches built on the spots from which,
according to tradition, rose the two arches or rainbows, crossing one
another at right angles, on which our Saviour is said to have sat when
he appeared to St.They consequently ought to be at the four
angles of a square, or rectangle of some sort, but this is far from
being the case.The principal of these churches is that whose plan is
represented in Woodcut No.It stands in the centre of a large
square, surrounded by ecclesiastical buildings, and is on the whole
rather an imposing edifice.Its porch is modern; so also, comparatively
speaking, is its dome; but the plan, if not the greater part of the
substructure, is ancient, and exhibits the plainness and simplicity
characteristic of its age.The other three churches lay claim to as
remote a date of foundation as this, but all have been so altered in
modern times that they have now no title to antiquity.The idea that the churches at Pitzounda and Bedochwinta must be
comparatively modern is confirmed by comparing their plan with that of
Kouthais, a church which there seems no reasonable ground for doubting
was founded in 1007, and erected, pretty much as we now find it, in the
early part of the 11th century.It has neither coupled piers nor pointed
arches, but is adorned externally with reed-like pilasters and elaborate
frets, such as were certainly employed at Ani in the course of the 11th
century.355) of one of its windows
exhibits the Armenian style of decoration of this age, but is such as
certainly was not employed before this time, though with various
modifications it became typical of the style at its period of greatest
development.Even Etchmiasdin, however, sinks into insignificance, in an
architectural point of view, when compared with Ani, which was the
capital of Armenia during its period of greatest unity and elevation,
and was adorned by the Bagratide dynasty with a series of buildings
which still strike the traveller with admiration, at least for the
beauty of their details; for, like all churches in this part of the
world, they are very small.If, however, the cathedral at Ani is
interesting to the architect from its style, it is still more so to the
archæologist from its date, since there seems no reason to doubt that it
was built in the year 1010, as recorded in an inscription on its walls.This, perhaps, might be put on one side as a mistake, if it were not
that there are two beautiful inscriptions on the façade, one of which is
dated 1049, the other 1059.To this we must add our knowledge that the
city was sacked by Alp Arslan in 1064, and that the dynasty which alone
could erect such a monument was extinguished in 1080.With all this
evidence, it is startling to find a church not only with pointed arches
but with coupled piers and all the characteristics of a complete
pointed-arch style, such as might be found in Italy or Sicily not
earlier than the 13th century.This peculiarity is, however, confined to
the constructive parts of the interior.The plan is that of Pitzounda or
Bedochwinta, modified only by the superior constructive arrangement
which the pointed arch enabled the architects to introduce; and
externally the only pointed arch anywhere to be detected, is in the
transept, where the arch of the vault is simulated to pass through to
the exterior.In the plan and elevation of the building will be observed a peculiarity
which was afterwards almost universal in the style.It is the angular
recess which marks the form of the apses outside without breaking the
main lines of the building.In the lateral elevation of this cathedral
(Woodcut No.358) they are introduced on each side of the portal where
the construction did not require them, in order to match those at the
east end.But in the Cathedral at Samthawis (Woodcut No.359) they are
seen in their proper places on each side of the central apse.Though
this church was erected between the years 1050-1079, we find these
niches adorned with a foliation (Woodcut No.360) very like what we are
accustomed to consider the invention of the 14th century in Europe,
though even more elegant than anything of its class used by the Gothic
architects.At Sandjerli, not far from Ani, is another church, which from
inscriptions translated by M. Brosset, and from sections given by him,
appears to belong to the same date (1033-1044), and to possess coupled
columns and pointed arches like those of the cathedral of Ani, which
indeed it resembles in many points, and which renders the date above
given highly probable.East Elevation of Chapel at Samthawis.The plans above quoted may probably be taken as those most typical of
the style, but in no part of the world are the arrangements of churches
so various.All being small, there were no constructive difficulties to
be encountered, and as no congregation was to be accommodated, the
architects apparently considered themselves at liberty to follow their
fancies in any manner that occurred to them.The consequence is that the
plans of Armenian churches defy classification; some are square, or
rectangles of every conceivable proportion of length to breadth, some
octagons or hexagons, and some of the most indescribable irregularity.Frequently two, three, or four are grouped and joined together.In some
instances the sacred number of seven are coupled together in one design,
though more generally each little church is an independent erection; but
they are all so small that their plans are of comparatively little
importance.No grandeur of effect or poetry of perspective can be
obtained without considerable dimensions, and these are not to be found
in Armenia.(From Layard’s ‘Nineveh and
Babylon.’)]

There are also some examples of circular churches, but these are far
from being numerous.Generally speaking they are tombs, or connected
with sepulchral rites, and are indeed mere amplifications of the usual
tombs of the natives of the country, which are generally little models
of the domes of Armenian churches placed on the ground, though perhaps
it would be more correct to say that the domes were copied from the
tombs than the reverse.The most elegant of all those hitherto made known is one found at Ani,
illustrated in Woodcuts Nos.Notwithstanding the smallness of
its dimensions, it is one of the most elegant sepulchral chapels known.Another on a larger scale (Woodcut No.This tomb shows all the peculiarities of the Armenian
style of the 11th or 12th century.Though so much larger, it is by no
means so beautiful as the last mentioned tomb at Ani.In its
ornamentation a further refinement is introduced, inasmuch as the
reed-like columns are tied together by true love-knots instead of
capitals—a freak not uncommon either in Europe at the same age, or in
the East at the present day, but by no means to be recommended as an
architectural expedient.With scarcely an exception, all the buildings in the Armenian provinces
are so small that they would hardly deserve a place in a history of
architecture were it not for the ingenuity of their plans and the
elegance of their details.The beauty of the latter is so remarkable
that, in order to convey a correct notion of the style, it would be
necessary to illustrate them to an extent incompatible with the scope of
this work.In them too will be found much that has hitherto been
ascribed to other sources.364), for
instance, would generally be put down as Saracenic of the best age, but
it belongs, with a great deal more quite as elegant, to one of the
churches at Ani; and the capital from Gelathi (Woodcut No.365) would
not excite attention if found in Ireland.The interlacing scrolls which
occupy its head are one of the most usual as well as one of the most
elegant modes of decoration employed in the province, and are applied
with a variety and complexity nowhere else found in stone, though they
may be equalled in some works illustrated by the pen.Besides, however, its beauty in an artistic point of view, this basket
pattern, as it is sometimes called, is still more so as an Ethnographic
indication which, when properly investigated, may lead to the most
important conclusions.366, 367, and
368, taken from churches at a now deserted village called Ish Khan, will
serve to explain its more usual forms; but it occurs almost everywhere
in the Armenian architectural province, and with as infinite a variety
of details as are to be found with its employment in Irish manuscripts.Window in small Church at Ish Khan, Tortoom.Jamb of doorway at Ish Khan Church, Armenia.Out of Armenia it occurs in the church at Kurtea el Argyisch in
Wallachia (Woodcut No.385), and is found in Hungary and Styria, and no
antiquary will probably fail to recognise it as the most usual and
beautiful pattern on Irish crosses and Scotch sculptured stones.On the
other hand it occurs frequently in the monolithic deepdans or lamp-posts
and in the temples on the Canarese or West Coast of India, and in all
these instances with so little change of form that it is almost
impossible that these examples should be independent inventions.Still
the gaps in the sequence are so great that it is very difficult to see
how they could emanate from one centre.Few, however, who know anything
of the early architecture of Ireland can fancy that it did come from
Rome across Great Britain, but that it must have had its origin further
east, among some people using groups of churches and small cells,
instead of congregational basilicas.So far, too, as we can yet see, it
is to the East we must look for the original design of the mysterious
round towers which form so characteristic a feature of Irish
architecture, and were afterwards so conspicuous as minars in the East,
and nowhere more so than in Armenia.Recent researches, too, are making
it more and more clear that Nestorian churches did exist all down the
West Coast of India from a very early period, so that it would not be
impossible that from Persia and Armenia they introduced the favourite
style of ornament.All this may seem idle speculation, and it may turn out that the
similarities are accidental, but at present it certainly does not look
as if they were, and if they do emanate from a common centre, tracing
them back to their original may lead to such curious ethnological and
historical conclusions that it is at all events worth while pointing
them out in order that others may pursue the investigation to its
legitimate conclusion.Taken altogether, Armenian architecture is far more remarkable for
elegance than for grandeur, and possesses none of that greatness of
conception or beauty of outline essential to an important architectural
style.It is still worthy of more attention than it has hitherto
received, even for its own sake.Its great title to interest will always
be its ethnological value, being the direct descendant of the Sassanian
style, and the immediate parent of that of Russia.At the same time,
standing on the eastern confines of the Byzantine Empire, it received
thence that impress of Christian art which distinguished it from the
former, and which it transmitted to the latter.It thus forms one of
those important links in the chain of architectural history which when
lost render the study of the subject so dark and perplexed, but when
appreciated add so immensely to its philosophical interest.ROCK-CUT CHURCHES.Churches at Tchekerman, Inkerman, and Sebastopol—Excavations at Kieghart
  and Vardzie.Intermediate between the Armenian province which has just been described
and the Russian, which comes next in the series, lies a territory of
more than usual interest to the archæologist, though hardly demanding
more than a passing notice in a work devoted to architecture.In the
neighbourhood of Kertch, which was originally colonised by a people of
Grecian or Pelasgic origin, are found numerous tumuli and sepulchres
belonging generally to the best age of Greek art, but which, barring
some slight local peculiarities, would hardly seem out of place in the
cemeteries of Etruria or Crete.At a later age it was from the shores of the Palus Mœotis and the
Caucasus that tradition makes Woden migrate to Scandinavia, bearing with
him that form of Buddhism[251] which down to the 11th century remained
the religion of the North—while, as if to mark the presence of some
strange people in the land, we find everywhere rock-cut excavations of a
character, to say the least of it, very unusual in the West.These have not yet been examined with the care necessary to enable us to
speak very positively regarding them;[252] but, from what we do know, it
seems that they were not in any instance tombs, like those in Italy and
many of those in Africa or Syria.Nor can we positively assert that any
of them were viharas or monasteries[253] like most of those in India.Generally they seem to have been ordinary dwellings, but in some
instances appropriated by the Christians and formed into churches.(From Dubois de Montpereux.)]One, apparently, of the oldest is a rectangular excavation at Tchekerman
in the Crimea.in length by 21 in width, with hardly any
decoration on its walls, but having in the centre a choir with four
pillars on each face, which there seems no doubt was originally devoted
to Christian purposes.The cross on the low screen that separates it
from the nave is too deeply cut and too evidently integral to have been
added.But for this it would seem to have been intended for a Buddhist
vihara.(From Dubois de
Montpereux.)]Under the fortress at Inkerman—facing the position held by our
army—there is an excavation undoubtedly of Christian origin.It is a
small church with side-aisles, apse, and all the necessary
accompaniments.Beyond this is a square excavation apparently intended
as a refectory, and other apartments devoted to the use of a monastic
establishment.These again are so like what we find among the Buddhist
excavations in India as to be quite startling.The one point in which
this church differs from a Buddhist chaitya is that the aisle does not
run round behind the altar.This is universally the case in Buddhist,
but only exceptionally so in Christian, churches.Close to Sebastopol is another small church cave with its accompanying
monastery.This one is said to be comparatively modern, and if its
paintings are parts of the original design it may be so, but no certain
data are given for fixing the age of the last two examples.That under
the fortress (Woodcut No.371) seems, however, to be of considerable
antiquity.There is one which in plan is very like those just described at Vardzie,
said to belong to the 12th century, and another, almost absolutely
identical with a Buddhist vihara, at Kieghart in Armenia, which has a
date upon it, A.D.On the banks of the Kour, however, at Ouplous-Tsikhe and Vardzie, are
some excavations which are either temples or monasteries, and which
range from the Christian era downwards.These are generally assumed to
be residences—one is called the palace of Queen Thamar—and they were
evidently intended for some stately purpose.Yet they were not temples
in any sense in which that term would be employed by the Greek or Roman
world.Whatever their destination, these rock-cut examples make, when
taken altogether, as curious a group of monuments as are to be found in
this corner of Asia, and which may lead afterwards to curious
archæological inferences.At present we are hardly in a position to
speculate on the subject, and merely point to it here as one well
meriting further investigation.MEDIÆVAL ARCHITECTURE OF RUSSIA.Churches at Kief—Novogorod—Moscow—Towers.Rurik the Varangian at Novogorod   A.D.850

The long series of the architectural styles of the Christian world which
has been described in the preceding pages terminates most appropriately
with the description of the art of a people who had less knowledge of
architecture and less appreciation of its beauties than any other with
which we are acquainted.During the Middle Ages the Russians did not
erect one single building which is worthy of admiration, either from its
dimensions, its design, or the elegance of its details; nor did they
invent one single architectural feature which can be called their own.It is true the Tartars brought with them their bulbous form of dome, and
the Russians adopted it, and adhere to it to the present day,
unconscious that it is the symbol of their subjection to a race they
affect to despise; but excepting as regards this one feature, their
architecture is only a bad and debased copy of the style of the
Byzantine Empire.There is nothing, in fact, in the architecture of the
country to lead us to doubt that the mass of the population of Russia
was always of purely Aryan stock, speaking a language more nearly allied
to the Sanskrit than any of the other Mediæval tongues of Europe, and
that whatever amount of Tartar blood may have been imported, it was not
sufficient to cure the inartistic tendencies of the race.So much is
this felt to be the case, that the Russians themselves hardly lay claim
to the design of a single building in their country from the earliest
times to the present day.They admit that all the churches at Kief,
their earliest capital, were erected by Greek architects; those of
Moscow by Italians or Germans; while those of St.Petersburg, we know,
were, with hardly a single exception, erected by Italian, German, or
French architects.These last have perpetrated caricatures of revived
Roman architecture worse than are to be found anywhere else.Bad as are
some of the imitations of Roman art found in western Europe, they are
all the work of native artists; are, partially at least, adapted to the
climate, and common-sense peeps through their worst absurdities; but in
Russia only second-class foreigners have been employed, and the result
is a style that out-herods Herod in absurdity and bad taste.Architecture has languished not only in Russia, but wherever the
Sclavonic race predominates.In Poland, Hungary, Moldavia, Wallachia,
&c., although some of these countries have at times been rich and
prosperous, there is not a single original structure worthy to be placed
in comparison with even the second-class contemporary buildings of the
Celtic or Teutonic races.Besides the ethnographic inaptitude of the nation, however, there are
other causes which would lead us to anticipate, _à priori_, that nothing
either great or beautiful was likely to exist in the Mediæval
architecture of Russia.In the first place, from the conversion of Olga
(964) to the accession of Peter the Great (1689), with whom the national
style expired, the country hardly emerged from barbarism.Torn by
internal troubles, or devastated by incursions of the Tartars, the
Russians never enjoyed the repose necessary for the development of art,
and the country was too thinly peopled to admit of that concentration of
men necessary for the carrying out of any great architectural
undertaking.Another cause of bad architecture is found in the material used, which
is almost universally brick covered with plaster; and it is well known
that the tendency of plaster architecture is constantly to extravagance
in detail and bad taste in every form.It is also extremely
perishable,—a fact which opens the way to repairs and alterations in
defiance of congruity and taste, and to the utter annihilation of
everything like archæological value in the building.When the material was not brick it was wood, like most of the houses in
Russia of the present day; and the destroying hand of time, aided no
doubt by fire and the Tartar invasions, have swept away many buildings
which would serve to fill up gaps, now, it is feared, irremediable in
the history of the art.Notwithstanding all this, the history of architecture in Russia need not
be considered as entirely a blank, or as wholly devoid of interest.Locally we can follow the history of the style from the south to the
north.Springing originally from two roots—one at Constantinople, the
other in Armenia—it gradually extended itself northward.It first
established itself at Cherson, then at Kief, and after these at Vladimir
and Moscow, whence it spread to the great commercial city of Novogorod.At all these places it maintained itself till supplanted by the rise of
St.Though the Princess Olga was baptised in 955, the general profession of
Christianity in Russia did not take place till the reign of Vladimir
(981-1015).He built the wooden cathedral at Cherson, which has
perished.At Kief the same monarch built the church of Dessiatinnaya,
the remains of which existed till within the last few years, when they
were removed to give place to a modern reproduction.Basil in the same city, which, notwithstanding modern
improvements, still retains its ancient plan, and is nearly identical in
arrangement and form with the Catholicon at Athens (Woodcut No.372) gives a fair idea of the usual dimensions of
the older churches of Russia.The parts shaded lighter are subsequent
additions.A greater builder than Vladimir was Prince Yaroslaf (1019-1054).Irene at Kief (Woodcut No.373), the ruins of
which still exist.It is a good specimen of the smaller class of
churches of that date.His great works were the cathedrals of Kief and Novogorod, both
dedicated to Sta.Sophia, and with the church at Mokwi quoted above
(Woodcut No.352) forming the most interesting group of Russian churches
of that age.All three belong to the 11th century, and are so extremely
similar in plan, that, deducting the subsequent additions from the two
Russian examples, they may almost be said to be identical.They also
show so intimate a connection between the places on the great commercial
road from the Caucasus to the Baltic, that they point out at once the
line along which we must look for the origin of the style.Of the three, that at Kief[254] (Woodcut No.374) is the largest; but it
is nearly certain that the two outer aisles are subsequent additions,
and that the original church was confined to the remaining seven aisles.As it now stands its dimensions are 185 ft.from north to south, and 136
from east to west.It consequently covers only about 25,000 ft., or not
half the usual dimensions of a Western cathedral of the same class.As
will be perceived, its plan is like that of the churches of Asia Minor,
so far as the central aisles are concerned.In lateral extension it
resembles a mosque, a form elsewhere very unusual in Christian churches,
but which here may be a Tartar peculiarity.At all events it is
generally found in Russian churches, which never adopt the long
basilican form of the West.If their length in an eastern and western
direction ever exceeds the breadth, it is only by taking in the narthex
with the body of the church.East End of the Church at Novogorod.Internally this church retains many of its original arrangements, and
many decorations which, if not original, are at least restorations or
copies of those which previously occupied their places.Externally it
has been so repaired and rebuilt that it is difficult to detect what
belongs to the original work.In this respect the church of Novogorod has been more fortunate.Owing
to the early decline of the town it has not been much modernised.The
interior retains many of its primitive features.Among other furniture
is a pair of bronze doors of Italian workmanship of the 12th century
closely resembling those of San Zenone at Verona.The part of the
exterior that retains most of its early features is the eastern end,
represented in the Woodcut No.It retains the long reed-like shafts
which the Armenians borrowed from the Sassanians, and which penetrated
even to this remote corner.Whether the two lower circular apses shown
in the view are old is by no means clear: but it is probable that they
are at least built on ancient foundations.The domes on the roof, and
indeed all the upper part of the building, belong to a more modern date
than the substructure.The cathedral of Tchernigow, near Kief, founded 1024, retains perhaps
more of its original appearance externally than any other church of its
age.Like almost all Russian churches it is square in plan, with a dome
in the centre surrounded by four smaller cupolas placed diagonally at
the corners.To the eastward are three apses, and the narthex is flanked
by two round towers, the upper parts of which, with the roofs, have been
modernised, but the whole of the walls remain as originally erected,
especially the end of the transept, which precisely resembles what we
find in Greek Churches of the period.(From Blasius, ‘Reise in
Russland.’)]

To the same age belong the convent of the Volkof (1100) and of Yourief
at Novogorod, the church of the Ascension, and several others at Kief.All these are so modernised as, except in their plans, to show but
slight traces of their origin.Another of the great buildings of the age was the cathedral of Vladimir
(1046).It is said to have been built, like the rest, by Greek artists.The richness and beauty of this building have been celebrated by early
travellers, but it has been entirely passed over by more modern writers.From this it is perhaps to be inferred that its ancient form is
completely disguised in modern alterations.The ascendency of Kief was of short duration.Early in the 13th century
the city suffered greatly from civil wars, fires, and devastations of
every description, which humbled her pride, and inflicted ruin upon her
from which she never wholly recovered.Vladimir was after this the residence of the grand dukes, and in the
beginning of the 14th century Moscow became the capital, which it
continued to be till the seat of empire was transferred by Peter the
Great to St.During these three centuries Moscow was no
doubt adorned with many important buildings, since almost every church
traces its foundation back to the 14th century; but as fires and Tartar
invasions have frequently swept over the city since then, few retain any
of the features of their original foundation, and it may therefore
perhaps be well to see what can be gleaned in the provinces before
describing the buildings of the capital.As far as can be gathered from the sketch-books of travellers or their
somewhat meagre notes, there are few towns of Russia of any importance
during the Middle Ages which do not possess churches said to have been
founded in the first centuries after its conversion to Christianity;
though whether the existing buildings are the originals, or how far they
may have been altered and modernised, will not be known till some
archæologist visits the country, directing his attention to this
particular inquiry.Although the Russians probably built as great a
number of churches as any nation of Christendom, yet like the Greek
churches they were all undoubtedly small.Kief is said, even in the age
of Yaroslaf, to have contained 400 churches; Vladimir nearly as many.Moscow, in the year 1600, had 400 (thirty-seven of which were in the
Kremlin), and now possesses many more.Many of the village churches still retain their ancient features; the
example here given of one near Novogorod belongs probably to the 12th
century, and is not later than the 13th.It retains its shafted apse,
its bulb-shaped Tartar dome, and, as is always the case in Russia, a
square detached belfry—though in this instance apparently more modern
than the edifice itself.378 is the type of a great number
of the old village churches, which, like the houses of the peasants, are
of wood, generally of logs laid one on the other, with their round ends
intersecting at the angles, like the log-huts of America at the present
day.As architectural objects they are of course insignificant, but
still they are characteristic and picturesque.Village Church near Tzarskoe Selo.Internally all the arrangements of the stone churches are such as are
appropriate for pictorial rather than for sculptural decoration.The
pillars are generally large cylinders covered with portraits of saints,
and the capitals are plain, cushion-like rolls with painted ornaments.The vaults are not relieved by ribs, or by any projections that could
interfere with the  decorations.In the wooden churches the
construction is plainly shown, and of course is far lighter.In them
also colour almost wholly supersedes carving.The peculiarities of these
two styles are well illustrated in the two Woodcuts, Nos.379 and 380,
from churches near Kostroma in Eastern Russia.Both belong to the Middle
Ages, and both are favourable specimens of their respective classes.In
these examples, as indeed in every Greek church, the principal object of
ecclesiastical furniture is the _iconostasis_ or image-bearer,
corresponding to the rood-screen that separates the choir from the nave
in Latin churches.The rood-screen, however, never assumed in the West
the importance which the iconostasis always possessed in the East.There
it separates and hides from the church the sanctuary and the altar, from
which the laity are wholly excluded.Within it the elements are
consecrated, in the presence of the priests alone, and are then brought
forward to be displayed to the public.On this screen, as performing so
important a part, the Greek architects and artists have lavished the
greatest amount of care and design, and in every Greek church, from St.Mark’s at Venice to the extreme confines of Russia, it is the object
that first attracts attention on entering.It is, in fact, so important
that it must be regarded rather as an object of architecture than of
church furniture.The architectural details of these Russian churches must be pronounced
to be bad; for, even making every allowance for difference of taste,
there is neither beauty of form nor constructive elegance in any part.The most characteristic and pleasing features are the five domes that
generally ornament the roofs, and which, when they rise from the
_extrados_, or uncovered outside of the vaults, certainly look well.Too
frequently, however, the vault is covered by a wooden roof, through
which the domes then peer in a manner by no means to be admired.The
details of the lower part are generally bad.381)
of a doorway of the Troitska monastery, near Moscow, is sufficiently
characteristic.Its most remarkable feature is the baluster-like
pillars, of which the Russians seem so fond.These support an arch with
a pendant in the middle—a sort of architectural _tour de force_ which
the Russian architects practised everywhere and in every age, but which
is far from being beautiful in itself, or from possessing any
architectural propriety.The great roll over the door is also
unpleasant.Indeed, as a general rule, wherever in Russian architecture
the details are original, they must be condemned as ugly.At Moscow we find much that is at all events curious.It first became a
city of importance about the year 1304, and retained its prosperity
throughout that century.During that time it was adorned by many
sumptuous edifices.In the beginning of the 15th century it was taken
and destroyed by the Tartars, and it was not till the reign of Ivan III.(1462-1505) that the city and empire recovered the disasters of that
period.It is extremely doubtful if any edifice now found in Moscow can
date before the time of this monarch.In the year 1479 this king dedicated the new church of the Assumption of
the Virgin, said to have been built by Aristotile Fioravanti, of
Bologna, in Italy, who was brought to Russia expressly for the purpose.382) gives a good idea of the arrangement of
a Russian church of this age.Small as are its dimensions—only 74 ft.by
56 over all externally, which would be a very small parish church
anywhere else—the two other cathedrals of Moscow, that of the Archangel
Michael and the Annunciation, are even smaller still in plan.Like true
Byzantine churches, they would all be exact squares, but that the
narthex being taken into the church gives it a somewhat oblong form.In
the Church of the Assumption there is, as is almost universally the
case, one large dome over the centre of the square, and four smaller
ones in the four angles.[255] The great iconostasis runs, as at Sta.Sophia at Kief, quite across the church; but the two lateral chapels
have smaller screens inside which hide their altars, so that the part
between the two becomes a sort of private chapel.This seems to be the
plan of the greater number of the Russian churches of this age.Doorway of the Troitzka Monastery, near Moscow.]Plan of the Church of the Assumption, Moscow.]View of the Church of Vassili Blanskenoy, Moscow.]But there is one church in Moscow, that of Vassili (St.Basil) Blajenny,
which is certainly the most remarkable, as it is the most
characteristic, of all the churches of Russia.It was built by Ivan the
Terrible (1534-1584), and its architect was a foreigner, generally
supposed to have come from the West, inasmuch as this monarch sent an
embassy to Germany under one Schlit, to procure artists, of whom he is
said to have collected 150 for his service.If, however, German workmen
erected this building, it certainly was from Tartar designs.Nothing
like it exists to the westward.It more resembles some Eastern pagoda of
modern date than any European structure, and in fact must be considered
as almost a pure Tartar building.Still, though strangely altered by
time, most of its forms can be traced back to the Byzantine style, as
certainly as the details of the cathedral of Cologne to the Romanesque.The central spire, for instance, is the form into which the Russians had
during five centuries been gradually changing the straight-lined dome of
the Armenians.The eight others are the Byzantine domes converted by
degrees into the bulb-like forms which the Tartars practised at Agra and
Delhi, as well as throughout Russia.The arrangement of these domes will
be understood by the plan (Woodcut No.383), which shows it to consist
of one central octagon surrounded by eight smaller ones, raised on a
platform ascended by two flights of stairs.Beneath the platform is a
crypt.For the general appearance the reader must be referred to Woodcut
No.384, for words would fail to convey any idea of so bizarre and
complicated a building.At the same time it must be imagined as painted
with the most brilliant colours; its domes gilt, and relieved by blue,
green, and red, and altogether a combination of as much barbarity as it
is possible to bring together in so small a space.To crown the whole,
according to the legend, Ivan ordered the eyes of the architect to be
put out, lest he should ever surpass his own handiwork; and we may feel
grateful that nothing so barbarous was afterwards attempted in Europe.View of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.(From ‘Jahrbuch
der Central Com.’)]

[Illustration: 386.Plan of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.Tower of Ivan Veliki, Moscow, with the Cathedrals of
the Assumption and the Archangel Gabriel.]Though not strictly speaking in Russia itself, there is at Kurtea
d’Argyisch, in Wallachia, 90 miles north-west from Bucharest, a church
which is so remarkable, so typical of the style, that it cannot be
passed over.It was erected in the first years of the 16th century
(1517-1526) by a Prince Nyagon, and is, so far as is at present known,
the most elaborate example of the style.All its ornamental details are
identical with those found at Ani and other places in Armenia, but are
used here in greater profusion and with better judgment than are to be
found in any single example in that country.In outline it is not so
wild as the Vassili Blanskenoy, but the interior is wholly sacrificed to
the external effect, and no other example can well be quoted on which
ornamental construction is carried to so great an extent, and generally
speaking in such good taste.The twisted cupolas that flank the
entrances might as well have been omitted, but the two central domes and
the way the semi-domes are attached to them are quite unexceptionable,
and altogether, with larger dimensions, and if a little more spread out,
it would be difficult to find a more elegant exterior anywhere.long by 50 wide it is too small for architectural effect,
but barring this it is the most elegant example of the Armeno-Russian or
Neo-Byzantine architecture which is known to exist anywhere, and one of
the most suggestive, if the Russians knew how to use it.[256]


                                TOWERS.Next in importance to the churches themselves are the belfries which
always accompany them.The Russians seem never to have adopted separate
baptisteries, nor did they affect any sepulchral magnificence in their
tombs.From the time of Herodotus the Scythians were great casters of
metal, and famous for their bells.The specimens of casting of this sort
in Russia reduce all the great bells of Western Europe to comparative
insignificance.It of course became necessary to provide places in which
to hang these bells: and as nothing, either in Byzantine or Armenian
architecture, afforded a hint for amalgamating the belfry with the
church, they went to work in their own way, and constructed the towers
wholly independent of the churches.Of all those in Russia, that of Ivan
Veliki, erected by the Czar Boris, about the year 1600, is the finest.It is surmounted by a cross 18 ft.high, making a total height of 269
ft.from the ground to the top of the cross.It cannot be said to have
any great beauty, either of form or detail: but it rises boldly from the
ground, and towers over all the other buildings of the Kremlin.With
this tower for its principal object, the whole mass of building is at
least picturesque, if not architecturally beautiful.388) the belfry is shown as it stood before it was blown up by the
French.It has since been rebuilt, and with the cathedrals on either
hand, makes up the best group in the Kremlin.Besides the belfries, the walls of the Kremlin are adorned with towers,
meant not merely for military defence, but as architectural ornaments,
and reminding us somewhat of those described by Josephus as erected by
Herod on the walls of Jerusalem.389),
built by the same Czar Boris who erected that last described, is a good
specimen of its class.It is one of the principal of those which give
the walls of the Kremlin their peculiar and striking character.These towers, however, are not peculiar to the Kremlin of Moscow.Every
city in Russia had its Kremlin, as every one in Spain had its Alcazar,
and all were adorned with walls deeply machicolated, and interspersed
with towers.Within were enclosed five-domed churches and belfries, just
as at Moscow, though on a scale proportionate to the importance of the
city.It would be easy to select numerous illustrations of this.They
are, however, all very much like one another, nor have they sufficient
beauty to require us to dwell long on them.Their gateways, however, are
frequently important.Every city had its _porta sacra_, deriving its
importance either from some memorable event or from miracles said to
have been wrought there, and being the triumphal gateways through which
all processions pass on state occasions.The best known of these is that of Moscow, beneath whose sacred arch
even the Emperor himself must uncover his head as he passes through; and
which, from its sanctity as well as its architectural character, forms
an important feature among the antiquities of Russia.So numerous are the churches, and, generally speaking, the fragments of
antiquity in this country, that it would be easy to multiply examples to
almost any extent.Those quoted in the preceding pages are,
architecturally, the finest as well as the most interesting from an
antiquarian point of view, of those which have yet been visited and
drawn; and there is no reason to believe that others either more
magnificent or more beautiful still remain undescribed.This being the case, it is safe to assert that Russia contains nothing
that can at all compare with the cathedrals, or even the parish
churches, of Western Europe, either in dimensions or in beauty of
detail.Every chapter in the history of architecture must contain
something to interest the student: but there is none less worthy of
attention than that which describes the architecture of Russia,
especially when we take into account the extent of territory occupied by
its people, and the enormous amount of time and wealth which has been
lavished on the multitude of insignificant buildings to be found in
every corner of the empire.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.Division and Classification of the Romanesque and Gothic Styles of
  Architecture in Italy.If a historian were to propose to himself the task of writing a
tolerably consecutive narrative of the events which occurred in Italy
during the Middle Ages, he would probably find such difficulties in his
way as would induce him to abandon the attempt.Venice and Genoa were as
distinct states as Spain and Portugal.Florence, the most essentially
Italian of the republics, requires a different treatment from the half
German Milan.Even such neighbouring cities as Mantua and Verona were
separate and independent states during the most important part of their
existence.Rome was, during the whole of the Middle Ages, more European
than Italian, and must have a narrative of her own; Southern Italy was a
foreign country to the states of the North; and Sicily has an
independent history.The same difficulties, though not perhaps to the same degree, beset the
historian of art, and, if it were proposed to describe in detail all the
varying forms of Italian art during the Middle Ages, it would be
necessary to map out Italy into provinces, and to treat each almost as a
separate kingdom by itself.In this, as in almost every instance,
however, the architecture forms a better guide-line through the tangled
mazes of the labyrinth than the written record of political events, and
those who can read her language have before them a more trustworthy and
vivid picture of the past than can be obtained by any other means.The great charm of the history of Mediæval art in England is its unity.It affords the picture of a people working out a style from chaos to
completeness, with only slight assistance from those in foreign
countries engaged in the same task.In France we have two elements, the
old Southern Romanesque long struggling with the Northern Celtic, and
unity only obtained by the suppression of the former, wherever they came
in contact.In Italy we have four elements,—the Roman, the Byzantine,
the Lombardic, and the Gothic,—sometimes existing nearly pure, at others
mixed, in the most varying proportions, the one with the other.In the North the Lombardic element prevailed; based on the one hand on
the traditions of Imperial Rome, and in consequence influenced in its
art by classical forms; and, on the other, inspired in all its details
by a vast accumulation of Byzantine work.In the 5th and 6th centuries
this work (chiefly confined to columns, screens, and altar pieces) was
executed by Greek artists sent on from Constantinople.The 7th century
seems to have been quite barren so far as architecture was concerned;
but in the 8th century, owing either to the Saracen invasion or to the
emigration caused by the persecution of the Iconoclasts in 788, the
Byzantine influence became again predominant, but no longer with that
same purity of design as we find in the earlier work of the 5th and 6th
centuries.In the South, the Byzantine forms prevailed, partly because the art was
there based on the traditions of Magna Grecia, and more, perhaps, from
the intimate connection that existed between Apulia and the Peloponnesus
during the Middle Ages.Between the two stood Rome, less changed than either North or South—the
three terms, Roman, Romano-Byzantine, and Renaissance comprise all the
variation she submitted to.In vain the Gothic styles besieged her on
the north and the Byzantine on the south.Their waves spent themselves
on her rock without producing much impression, while her influence
extended more or less over the whole peninsula.It was distinctly felt
at Florence and at Pisa on the north and west, though these conquests
were nearly balanced by the Byzantine influence which is so distinctly
felt at Venice or Padua on the east coast.The great difficulty in the attempt to reconcile these architectural
varieties with the local and ethnographical peculiarities of the
people—a difficulty which at first sight appears all but insuperable—is,
that sometimes all three styles are found side by side in the same city.This, however, constitutes, in reality, the intrinsic merit of
architecture as a guide in these difficulties.What neither the language
of the people nor their histories tell us, their arts proclaim in a
manner not to be mistaken.Just in that ratio in which the Roman,
Byzantine, or Lombardic style prevails in their churches, to that extent
did either of these elements exist in the blood of the people.Once
thoroughly master the peculiarities of their art, and we can with
certainty pronounce when any particular race rose to power, how long its
prevalence lasted, and when it was obliterated or fused with some other
form.There is no great difficulty in distinguishing between the Byzantine and
the other two styles, so far as the form of dome is concerned.The
latter is almost always rounded externally, the former almost always
straight-lined.Again: the Byzantine architects never used intersecting
vaults for their naves.If forced to use a pointed arch, they did so
unwillingly, and it never fitted kindly to their favourite circular
forms; the style of their ornamentation was throughout peculiar, and
differed in many essential respects from the other two styles.It is less easy always to discriminate between the Gothic and Lombardic
in Italy.We frequently find churches of the two styles built side by
side in the same age, both using round arches, and with details not
differing essentially from one another.There is one test, however,
which is probably in all cases sufficient.Every Gothic church had, or
was intended to have, a vault over its central aisle.The importance of the distinction is apparent
throughout.The Gothic churches have clustered piers, tall
vaulting-shafts, external and internal buttresses, and are prepared
throughout for this necessity of Gothic art.The early Christian
churches, on the contrary, have only a range of columns, generally of a
pseudo-Corinthian order, between the central and side aisles; internally
no vaulting-shafts, and externally only pilasters.Had these architects
been competent, as the English were, to invent an ornamental wooden
roof, they would perhaps have acted wisely; but though they made several
attempts, especially at Verona, they failed signally to devise any mode
either of hiding the mere mechanical structure of their roofs or of
rendering them ornamental.Vaulting was, in fact, the real formative idea of the Gothic style, and
it continued to be its most marked characteristic during the continuance
of the style, not only in Italy, but throughout all Europe.As it is impossible to treat of these various styles in one sequence,
various modes of precedence might be adopted, for each of which good
reasons could be given; but the following will probably be found most
consonant with the arrangement elsewhere adopted in this work:—

First, to treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy
down to the age of Charlemagne, and to trace out its history down to the
11th century, in order to include all that work executed by Greek
artists or copied from it by Lombardic artists; a phase which might
appropriately be termed the Byzantine-Lombardic style.Secondly, to follow the history of the formation of the round-arched
style in Lombardy and North Italy, which constitutes the real Lombardic
style.Thirdly, to take up the Byzantine-Romanesque style as it was practised
in the centre and South of Italy; because it follows chronologically
more closely the art of the North of Italy.Fourthly, to follow the changes which the influence of the Gothic style
exercised in the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy.Sicily will demand a chapter to herself; not only because a fourth
element is introduced there in the Saracenic—which influenced her style
almost as much as it did that of the South of Spain—but because such
pointed Gothic as she possesses was not German, like that of Northern
Italy, but derived far more directly from France, under either the
Norman or Angiovine dynasties.Gothic architecture in Palestine also
requires a chapter, and is best described here owing to its close
resemblance to the style in the South of Italy.EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE-LOMBARDIC STYLES.Paul’s—Ravenna—St.Mark’s,

                               BASILICAS.Like the study of all modern history, that of Christian architecture
commences with Rome; and not, as is sometimes supposed, where the
history of Rome leaves off, but far back in the Empire, if not, indeed,
almost in the Republic.As has already been pointed out, the whole history of the art in
Imperial Rome is that of a style in course of transition, beginning with
a purely Pagan or Grecian style in the age of Augustus, and passing into
one almost wholly Christian in the age of Constantine.At the first epoch of the Empire the temple architecture of Rome
consisted in an external arrangement of columns, without arches or
vaults, and was wholly unsuited for the purposes of Christian worship.Towards the end of the period it had become an internal architecture,
making use of arches and vaults almost entirely to the exclusion of the
columnar orders, except as ornaments, and became so perfectly adapted to
Christian requirements, that little or no essential change in it has
taken place from that time to the present day.A basilica of the form
adopted in the first century after Constantine is as suited now as it
was then to the forms and ceremonies of the Christian ritual.The fact seems to be, that during the first three centuries after the
Christian era an immense change was silently but certainly working its
way in men’s minds.The old religion was effete: the best men, the most
intellectual spirits of the age, had no faith in it; and the new
religion with all its important consequences was gradually supplying its
place in the minds of men long before it was generally accepted.There is thus no real distinction between the Emilian or Ulpian
basilicas and those which Constantine erected for the use of the early
Christian republic.Nor is it possible, in such a series as the
Pantheon, the Temple of Minerva Medica, and the Church of San Vitale at
Ravenna, to point out what part really belongs to Pagan and what to
Christian art.It is true that Constantine fixed the epoch of completed transition, and
gave it form and substance; but long before his time Paganism was
impossible and a reform inevitable.The feeling of the world had
changed—its form of utterance followed as a matter of course.Viewed in this light, it is impossible to separate the early history of
Christian art from that of Imperial Rome.The sequence is so immediate
and the change so gradual, that a knowledge of the first is absolutely
indispensable to a right understanding of the second.One of the most remarkable facts connected with the early history of the
Christian religion is, that neither its Founder nor any of His more
immediate successors left any specific directions either as to the
liturgical forms of worship to be observed by His followers, nor laid
down any rules to be observed in the government of the newly established
Church.Under these circumstances it was left almost wholly to those to
whose care the infant congregation was entrusted to frame such
regulations for its guidance as the exigencies of the occasion might
dictate, and gradually to appoint such forms of worship as might seem
most suitable to express the purity of the new faith, but at the same
time with a dignity befitting its high mission.In Judea these ceremonies, as might naturally be expected, were strongly
tinctured with the forms of the Mosaic dispensation; but it appears to
have been in Africa, and more especially in the pomp-loving and
ceremonious Egypt, that fixed liturgies and rites first became an
integral part of the Christian religion.In those countries far from the
central seat of government, more liberty of conscience seems to have
been attained at an early period than would have been tolerated in the
capital.Before the time of Constantine they possessed not only
churches, but a regularly established hierarchy and a form of worship
similar to what afterwards obtained throughout the whole Christian
world.The form of the government of the Church, however, was long
unsettled.At first it seems merely to have been that the most respected
individuals of each isolated congregation were selected to form a
council to advise and direct their fellow-Christians, to receive and
dispense their alms, and, under the simple but revered title of
Presbyters, to act as fathers rather than as governors to the scattered
communities by which they were elected.The idea, however, of such a
council naturally includes that of a president to guide their
deliberations and give unity and force to their decisions; and such we
soon find springing up under the title of Bishops, or Presbyter Bishops,
as they were first called.During the course of the second century the
latter institution seems gradually to have gained strength at the
expense of the power of the Presbyters, whose delegate the Bishop was
assumed to be.In that capacity the Bishops not only took upon
themselves the general direction of the affairs of the Church, but
formed themselves into separate councils and synods, meeting in the
provincial capitals of the provinces where they were located.These
meetings took place under the presidency of the Bishop of the city in
which they met, who thus assumed to be the chief or metropolitan.These
formed a new presbytery above the older institution, which was thus
gradually superseded—to be again surpassed by the great councils which,
after the age of Constantine, formed the supreme governing body of the
Church; performing the functions of the earlier provincial synods with
more extended authority, though with less unanimity and regularity than
had characterised the earlier institution.It was thus that during the first three centuries of its existence the
Christian community was formed into a vast federal republic, governed by
its own laws, administered by its own officers, acknowledging no
community with the heathen and no authority in the constituted secular
powers of the State.But at the same time the hierarchy admitted a
participation of rights to the general body of the faithful, from whom
they were chosen, and whose delegation was still admitted to be their
title to office.When, in the time of Constantine, this persecuted and scattered Church
emerged from the Catacombs to bask in the sunshine of Imperial favour,
there were no buildings in Rome, the plan of which was more suited to
their purposes than that of the basilicas of the ancient city.Though
designed and erected for the transaction of the affairs of the heathen
Empire, they happened to be, in consequence of their disposition and
immense size, eminently suited for the convenience of the Christian
Church, which then aspired to supersede its fallen rival and replace it
by a younger and better institution.[257]

In the basilica the whole congregation of the faithful could meet and
take part in the transaction of the business going on.The bishop
naturally took the place previously occupied by the prætor or quæstor,
the presbyters those of the assessors.The altar in front of the apse,
where the pious heathen poured out libations at the commencement and
conclusion of all important business, served equally for the celebration
of Christian rites, and with the fewest possible changes, either in the
form of the ceremonies or in the nature of the business transacted
therein, the basilica of the heathen became the ecclesia or place of
assembly of the early Christian community.In addition, however, to the rectangular basilica, which was essentially
the place of meeting for the transaction of the business of the Church,
the Christian community early adopted a circular-formed edifice as a
ceremonial or sacramental adjunct to the basilica.These were copied
from the Roman tombs above described, and were in fact frequently built
for the sepulchres of distinguished persons; but they were also used at
a very early date as baptisteries, as well as for the performance of
funereal rites.It does not appear that baptism, the marriage rites, or
indeed any of the sacraments, were performed in the earliest ages in the
basilica, though in after ages a font was introduced even into
cathedrals.The rectangular church became ultimately the only form used.In the earlier ages, however, a complete ecclesiastical establishment
consisted of a basilica, and a baptistery, independent of one another
and seldom ranged symmetrically, though the tendency seems to have been
to place the round church opposite the western or principal entrance of
the basilica.Though this was the case in the capital and other great cities, it was
otherwise before the time of Constantine in the provinces.There the
Christian communities existed as members of a religious sect long before
they aspired to political power or dreamt of superseding the secular
form of government by combination among themselves.In the remote parts
of the Empire, in the earliest ages, they consequently built for
themselves churches which were temples, or, in other words, houses of
prayer, designed for and devoted wholly to the celebration of religious
rites, as in the Pagan temples, and without any reference to the
government of the community or the transaction of the business of the
assembly.If any such existed in Italy or any other part of Europe, they
either perished in the various persecutions to which the Christians were
exposed when located near the seat of government, or they became
hallowed by the memories of the times of martyrdom, and were rebuilt in
happier days with greater magnificence, so that little or no trace of
the original buildings now remains.So long, therefore, as our
researches were confined to European examples, the history of Christian
architecture began with Constantine; but recent researches in Africa
have shown that, when properly explored, we shall certainly be able to
carry the history of the early Christian style in that country back to a
date at least a century before his time.In Syria and Asia Minor so many
early examples have come to light that it seems probable that we may,
before long, carry the history of Byzantine art back to a date nearly
approaching that of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.It is,
however, only so recently that the attention of ecclesiologists has been
directed to the early examples of Christian architecture, that it is not
yet possible to grasp completely the whole bearing of the subject; but
enough is known to show how much the progress of research may modify the
views hitherto entertained on the subject.Meanwhile too much attention
can hardly be bestowed upon it, as it is by means of these early
specimens of architectural art that we shall probably be best able to
recover the primitive forms of the Christian liturgical observance.One of the most ancient as well as interesting of the African churches
which has yet been brought to light is that at Djemla.It is a simple
rectangle, internally 92 ft.by 52, divided longitudinally with three
aisles, the centre one of which terminates in a square cella or choir,
which seems to have been enclosed up to the roof; but the building is so
ruined that this cannot be known for a certainty.Though so exceptional,
it is not difficult to see whence the form was derived.If we take such
a plan, for instance, as that of the Maison Carré at Nîmes (Woodcut No.187), and build a wall round and put a roof over it, so as to make a
building which was originally appropriated to external worship suitable
for internal religious purposes, we should have exactly such a result as
this.The cella must be diminished in extent, the pillars more widely
spaced, and the front row converted into a wall in which the entrances
would be usually placed.In this instance the one entrance, for some
local reason, is lateral.The whole floor of the church is covered with
a mosaic so purely classical in style of execution as to leave no doubt
as to its early date.A more common form is shown in the annexed woodcut, representing a small
church at Announa, likewise in Algeria, about 45 ft.square, divided
into three aisles and with a projecting apse.If we turn to the plan of
the Temple of Mars Ultor (Woodcut No.186), we see at once whence this
form was derived.It only requires the lateral columns to be brought
slightly forward to effect the requisite change.When the building was
to be used by a congregation, and not merely for display, the pillars
would require to be more widely spaced.A third form, from Ibrim in Nubia, shows the peculiarity of the apse
being internal, which became very fashionable in the Eastern, though not
so much so in the Western, churches, but still sufficiently so to make
its introduction at this early age worthy of notice.The building is
small, being only 57 ft.in length externally, but is remarkable for
being built with something of the solidity of the Egyptian edifices
among which it stands.The next example which it may be necessary to quote to make this early
form intelligible, is that of the church of St.Reparatus, near
Orleansville—the ancient Castellum Tingitanum.According to an
inscription still existing, it was erected A.D.252,[258] but the second
apse seems to have been added at a later date, to contain the grave of
the saint.As it now stands, it is a double-apsed basilica 80 ft.long
by 52 broad, divided into five aisles, and exhibiting on a miniature
scale all the peculiarities of plan which we have hitherto fancied were
not adopted until some centuries later.In this instance both the apses
are internal, so that the side-aisles are longer than the centre one, no
portion of them appearing to have been cut off for chalcidica or
vestries, as was very generally the case in this age.Another example, very much like this in arrangement, but on a larger
scale, is found at Ermet, the ancient Hermonthis in Egypt.by 90, and, if the plan in the great French work[259]
is to be depended upon, is one of the most complete examples of its
class.It has four ranges of columns, taken apparently from more ancient
examples, and two apses with all the usual appurtenances.Plan of Church at Ibrim in Nubia.Another two-aisled and single apse church, measuring 100 ft.by 65,
called Dyer Abou Taneh, is represented in the same work;[260] but
perhaps the most interesting of these churches is that known as the
White Convent, situated on the edge of the Libyan Desert, above Siout.by 122, and is enclosed in a solid wall,
surmounted by an Egyptian cornice, so that it looks much more like an
ancient temple than a Christian church.Originally it had six doors, but
all are now walled up, except one in the centre of the southern face;
and above, a series of small openings, like loopholes, admitted light to
apartments which apparently occupied the upper storey of lateral
corridors.Light to the church was, of course, admitted through the
clerestory, which could easily be done; and altogether as a fortified
and mysterious abode, and place of worship of ascetics, it would be
difficult to find a more appropriate example.The age of this church is not very well ascertained; popularly it is,
like so many others, ascribed to Sta.Helena, and the double aisles and
triapsal arrangements are so like her church at Bethlehem, that there is
no _à priori_ improbability in the assumption.The plan, however, is
more complicated and complete, and its external form bespeaks of
troublous times, so that altogether it is probably a century or two (the
monks say 140 years) more modern.Like other churches of its class,
ancient materials have been so used up with those prepared at the time,
that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the dates of such buildings.If, however, any one with sufficient knowledge would make a special
study of these Egyptian churches, he would add one of the most
interesting chapters to our history of early Christian Architecture, and
explain many ritual arrangements whose origin is now involved in
mystery; but for this we must wait.The materials are not at present
available, all travellers in Egypt being so attracted by the surpassing
interest of the Pagan remains of that country, as hardly to find time
for a glance at the Christian antiquities.[261]

[Illustration: 394.It was probably in a great measure owing to the influence of these
provincial examples that the arrangements of the metropolitan basilicas
were not long allowed to retain the form above described, though more
was probably due to the change which was gradually taking place in the
constitution of the governing body of the Church.The early arrangements
of the Christian basilica, as copied from the secular forms of the Pagan
places of assembly, soon became unsuited to the more exclusively
religious purposes to which they were to be appropriated.The now
dominant hierarchy of Rome soon began to repudiate the republicanism of
the early days of the Church, and to adopt from the East the convenient
doctrine of the absolute separation of the congregation into clergy and
laity.To accommodate the basilica to this new state of things, first
the apse was railed off and appropriated wholly to the use of the
clergy: then the whole of the dais, or raised part in front of the apse
on which the altar stood, was separated by pillars, called cancelli, and
in like manner given up wholly to the clergy, and was not allowed to be
profaned by the presence of the unordained multitude.The last great change was the introduction of a choir, or enclosed space
in the centre of the nave, attached to the bema or _presbytery_, as the
raised space came to be called.Round three sides of this choir the
faithful were allowed to congregate to hear the Gospels or Epistles read
from the two pulpits or _ambones_, which were built into its enclosure,
one on either side; or to hear the services which were read or sung by
the inferior order of clergy who occupied its precincts.The enclosure of the choir was kept low, so as not to hide the view of
the raised presbytery, or to prevent the congregation from witnessing
the more sacred mysteries of the faith which were there performed by the
higher order of clergy.Another important modification, though it entailed no architectural
change, was the introduction of the bodies of the saints in whose honour
the building was erected into the basilica itself, and depositing them
in a confessional or crypt below the high altar.There is every reason to believe that a separate circular building, or
proper tomb, was originally erected over the grave or place of
martyrdom, and the basilica was sanctified merely by its propinquity to
the sacred spot.Afterwards the practice of depositing the relics of the
saint beneath the floor became universally the rule.At about the same
time the baptistery was also absorbed into the basilica; and instead of
standing opposite the western entrance, a font placed within the western
doors supplied its place.This last change was made earlier at Rome than
elsewhere.It is not known at what exact period the alteration was
introduced, but it is probable that the whole was completed before the
age of Gregory the Great.It was thus that in the course of a few centuries the basilicas
aggregated within themselves all the offices of the Roman Church, and
became the only acknowledged ecclesiastical buildings—either as places
for the assembly of the clergy for the administration of the sacraments
and the performance of divine worship, or for the congregation of the
faithful.None of the basilican churches, either of Rome or the provinces, possess
these arrangements exactly as they were originally established in the
fourth or fifth century.The church of San Clemente, however, retains
them so nearly in their primitive form that a short description of it
may tend to make what follows more easily intelligible.This basilica
seems to have been erected in the fourth or fifth century over what was
supposed to be the house in which the saint of that name resided.Recently a subterranean church or crypt has been discovered, which must
of course be more ancient than the present remains.[262] Above this
subterranean church stands the edifice shown in the accompanying plan
(Woodcut No.395), nearly one-third less in size, being only 65 ft.wide
internally, against 93 of the original church, though both were about
the same length.Plan of the Church of San Clemente at Rome.(From
Gutensohn and Knapp.to 1 in]

It is one of the few that still possesses an _atrium_ or courtyard in
front of the principal entrance, though there can be but little doubt
that this was considered at that early age a most important, if not
indeed an indispensable, attribute to the church itself.As a feature it
may have been derived from the East, where we know it was most common,
and where it afterwards became, with only the slightest possible
modifications, the mosque of the Moslems.It would seem even more
probable, however, that it is only a repetition of the _forum_, which
was always attached to the Pagan basilica, and through which it was
always entered; and for a sepulchral church at least nothing could be
more appropriate, as the original application of the word forum seems to
have been to the open area that existed in front of tombs as well as of
other important buildings.[264]

In the centre of this atrium there generally stood a fountain or tank of
water, not only as an emblem of purity, but that those who came to the
church might wash their hands before entering the holy place—a custom
which seems to have given rise to the practice of dipping the fingers in
the holy water of the piscina, now universal in all Catholic countries.The colonnade next the church was frequently the only representative of
the atrium, and then—perhaps indeed always—was called the _narthex_, or
place for penitents or persons who had not yet acquired the right of
entering the church itself.From this narthex three doorways generally opened into the church,
corresponding with the three aisles; and if the building possessed a
font, it ought to have been placed in one of the chapels on either the
right or left hand of the principal entrance.The choir, with its two pulpits, is shown in the plan—that on the
left-hand side being the pulpit of the Epistle, that on the right of the
Gospel.The railing of the _bema_ or presbytery is also marked, so is
the position of the altar with its canopy supported on four pillars, and
behind that the throne of the bishop, with the seats of the inferior
clergy surrounding the apse on either side.Besides the church of San Clemente there are at least thirty other
basilican churches in Rome, extending in date from the 4th to the 14th
century.Their names and dates, as far as they have been ascertained,
are set forth in the accompanying list, which, though not altogether

Three of these, St.Paul’s, and the Lateran church, have
five aisles, all the rest three, with only one insignificant exception,
Sta.Balbina, which has no side-aisles.Agnes and the old part
of St.Lorenzo, have their side-aisles in two storeys, all the rest are
only one storey in height, and the side-aisles generally are half the
width of the central aisle or nave.Some of the more modern churches
have the side-aisles vaulted, but of those in the list all except the
two last have flat wooden ceilings over the central compartment, and
generally speaking the plain ornamental construction of the roof is
exposed.It can scarcely be doubted that originally they were ceiled in
some more ornamental manner, as the art of ornamenting this new style of
open construction seems to have been introduced at a later date.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Maria sopra Minerva might perhaps be
more properly classed among the buildings belonging to the Italian
Gothic style; but as it is the only one in Rome that has any claim to
such a distinction, it is hardly worth while making it an exception to
the rest.The San Agostino might also be called a Renaissance specimen.It certainly is a transitional specimen between the pillared and
pilastered styles, which were then struggling for mastery.It may either
be regarded as the last of the old race or the first of the new style,
which was so soon destined to revolutionise the architectural world.Of the other examples the oldest was the finest.This great basilica was
erected in the reign of Constantine, close to the circus of Nero, where
tradition affirmed that St.It
unfortunately was entirely swept away to make room for the greatest of
Christian temples, which now occupies its site; but previous to its
destruction careful measurements and drawings were made of every part,
from which it is easy to understand all its arrangements—easier perhaps
than if it had remained to the present day, and four centuries more of
reform and improvements had assisted in altering and disfiguring its
venerable frame.As will be seen in the plan (Woodcut No.396), drawn to the usual scale,
it possessed a noble atrium or forecourt, 212 ft.by 235, in front of
which were some bold masses of building, which, during the Middle Ages,
were surmounted by two belfry-towers.in
width by 380 in length, covering, without its adjuncts, an area of above
80,000 English feet, which, though less than half the size of the
present cathedral, is as large as that covered by any mediæval cathedral
except those of Milan and Seville.across (about twice the average width of a Gothic nave), and nearly the
same as that of the basilica of Maxentius and the principal halls of the
greater thermæ.For some reason or other this dimension seems to have
been a modulus very generally adopted.The bema or sanctuary, answering
to the Gothic transept, extended beyond the walls of the church either
way, which was unusual in early Christian buildings.The object here
seems to have been to connect it with the tombs on its north side.The
arrangement of the sanctuary was also peculiar, having been adorned with
twelve pillars supporting a gallery.These, when symbolism became the
fashion, were said to represent the twelve apostles.This certainly was
not their original intent, as at first only six were put up—the others
added afterwards.The sanctuary and choir were here singularly small and
contracted, as if arranged before the clergy became so numerous as they
afterwards were, and before the laity were excluded from this part of
the church.The general internal appearance of the building will be understood from
the following woodcut (No.397), which presents at one view all the
peculiarities of the basilican buildings.The pillars separating the
central from the side aisles appear to have been of uniform dimensions,
and to have supported a horizontal entablature, above which rose a
double range of panels, each containing a picture—these panels thus
taking the place of what was the triforium in Gothic churches.Over
these was the clerestory, and again an ornamental belt gave sufficient
elevation for the roof, which in this instance showed the naked
construction.On the whole perhaps the ratio of height to width is
unexceptionable, but the height over the pillars is so great that they
are made to look utterly insignificant, which indeed is the great defect
in the architectural design of these buildings, and, though seldom so
offensive as here, is apparent in all.The ranges of columns dividing
the side-aisles were joined by arches, which is a more common as well as
a better arrangement, as it not only adds to the height of the pillars,
but gives them an apparent power of bearing the superstructure.At some
period during the Middle Ages the outer aisles were vaulted, and Gothic
windows introduced into them.This change seems to have necessitated the
closing of the intermediate range of clerestory windows, which probably
was by no means conducive to the general architectural effect of the
building.Peter, before its
destruction in the 15th century.Externally this basilica, like all those of its age, must have been
singularly deficient in beauty or in architectural design.The sides
were of plain unplastered brick, the windows were plain arch-headed
openings.The front alone was ornamented, and this only with two ranges
of windows somewhat larger than those at the sides, three in each tier,
into which tracery was inserted at some later period, and between and
above these, various figures and emblems were painted in fresco on
stucco laid on the brickwork.The whole was surmounted by that singular
coved cornice which seems to have been universal in Roman basilicas,
though not found anywhere else that I am aware of.The two most interesting adjuncts to this cathedral were the two tombs
standing to the northward.According to the mediæval tradition the one
was the tomb of Honorius and his wives, the other the church of St.Their position, however, carefully centred on the spina of the
circus of Nero, where the great apostle suffered martyrdom, seems to
point to a holier and more important origin.My own conviction is that
they were erected to mark the places where the apostle and his
companions suffered.It is besides extremely improbable that after the
erection of the basilica an emperor should choose the centre of a circus
for the burying-place of himself and his family, or that he should be
permitted to choose so hallowed a spot.They are of exactly the usual
tomb-form of the age of Constantine, and of the largest size, being each
100 ft.The first was destroyed by Michael Angelo, as it stood on the site
required for his northern tribune, the second by Pius VI., in 1776, to
make way for the present sacristy, and Rome thus lost, through pure
carelessness, the two oldest and most sacred edifices of the Christian
period which she possessed.The most eastern had been so altered and overlaid, having been long used
as a sacristy,[266] that it might have been difficult to restore it; but
its position and its antiquity certainly entitled it to a better fate.The church of San Paolo fuori le Mura was almost an exact counterpart of
St.Peter’s both in design and dimensions.The only important variations
were that the transept was made of the same width as the central nave,
or about 80 ft., and that the pillars separating the nave from the
side-aisles were joined by arches instead of by a horizontal architrave.Both these were undoubted improvements, the first giving space and
dignity to the bema, the latter not only adding height to the order, but
giving it, together with lightness, that apparent strength requisite to
support the high wall placed over the pillars.Paul’s, at Rome, before
the fire.]The order too was finer and more important than at St.Peter’s,
twenty-four of the pillars being taken from some temple or building (it
is generally said the mausoleum of Hadrian) of the best age of Rome,
though the remaining sixteen were unfortunately only very bad copies of
them.in height, or one-third of the whole
height of the building to the roof.Peter’s they were only a
fourth, and if they had been spaced a little farther apart, and the arch
made more important, the most glaring defect of these buildings would in
a great measure have been avoided.Long before its destruction by fire in 1822 this church had been so
altered as to lose many of its most striking peculiarities.The bema or
presbytery was divided into two by a longitudinal wall.The greater
number of its clerestory windows were built up, its atrium gone, and
decay and whitewash had done much to efface its beauty, which
nevertheless seems to have struck all travellers with admiration, as
combining in itself the last reminiscence of Pagan Rome with the
earliest forms of the Christian world.It certainly was the most
interesting, if not quite the most beautiful, of the Christian
buildings, of that city.[267]

The third five-aisled basilica, that of St.John Lateran, differs in no
essential respect from those just described except in dimensions; it
covers about 60,000 ft., and consequently is inferior in this respect to
the other two.It has been so completely altered in modern times that
its primitive arrangements can now hardly be discerned, nor can their
effect be judged of, even assuming that they were peculiar to it, which,
however, is by no means certain.Like the other two, it appears to have been originally erected by
Constantine, who seems especially to have affected this five-aisled
form.The churches which he erected at Jerusalem and Bethlehem both have
this number of aisles.From the similarity which exists in the design of
all these churches we might easily restore this building, if it were
worth while.Its dimensions can easily be traced, but beyond this
nothing remains of the original erection.Of those with three aisles by far the finest and most beautiful is that
of S. Maria Maggiore, which, notwithstanding the comparative smallness
of its dimensions, is now perhaps the best specimen of its class
remaining.in width by 250 to the
front of the apse; the whole area being about 32,000 ft.: so that it is
little more than half the size of the Lateran church, and between
one-third and one-fourth of that of the other two five-aisled churches.Notwithstanding this, there is great beauty in its internal colonnade,
all the pillars of which are of one design, and bear a most pleasing
proportion to the superstructure.The clerestory too is ornamented with
pilasters and panels, making it a part of the general design; and with
the roof, which is panelled with constructive propriety and simplicity
combined with sufficient richness, serves to make up a whole which gives
a far better and more complete idea of what a basilica either was
originally, or at least might have been, than any other church at Rome.It is true that both the pilasters of the clerestory and the roof are
modern, and in modern times the colonnade has been broken through in two
places; but these defects must be overlooked in judging of the whole.Another defect is that the side-aisles have been vaulted in modern
times, and in such a manner as to destroy the harmony that should exist
between the different parts of the building.In striving to avoid the
defect of making the superstructure too high in proportion to the
columns, the architect has made the central roof too low either for the
width or length of the main aisle.Still the building, as a whole, is—or
rather was before the completion of the rebuilding of St.Paul’s—the
very best of the older wooden-roofed churches of Christendom, and the
best model from which to study the merits and defects of this style of
architecture.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)](From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Another mode of getting over the great defect of high walls over the
pillars was adopted, as in St.Agnese, of using a
gallery corresponding with the triforium of Gothic churches.Lorenzo, where this feature first occurs, it would seem to have been
derived from the Eastern Empire, where the custom of providing galleries
for women had long been established; this is rendered probable by the
fact that the sculpture of the capitals carrying the arches of the
triforium is of pure Byzantine character, and by the adoption of what is
virtually a dosseret,[268] or projecting impost above the capital to
carry the arches, which at their springing are considerably wider and
deeper than the abacus of the capital.According to M. Cattaneo[269] the
earliest part of this church is the Eastern end, built by Constantine
(see plan, Woodcut No.403), which first consisted of nave, aisles, and
a Western apse.In the Pontificate of Sixtus III.(432-440) an immense
basilica was added on the Western side with an Eastern apse built back
to back with the original apse; and later on, in 578-590, galleries were
added to the Western church by Pope Pelagius II.In 1226-1227, when Honorius III.restored the whole building, he removed
the two apses, continued the new arcade up to the early Western wall,
and raised the choir of the early church to its present elevation
(Woodcut No.Agnes the galleries may
have been suggested if not required by the peculiarity of the ground,
which was higher on one side than on the other; but whether this was the
true cause of its adoption or not, the effect was most satisfactory, and
had it been persevered in so as to bring the upper colonnade more into
harmony of proportion with the other, it would have been attended with
the happiest results on the style.Whether it was, however, that the
Romans felt the want of the broad plain space for their paintings, or
that they could not bring the upper arches into proportion with the
classical pillars which they made use of, the system was abandoned
almost as soon as adopted, and never came into general use.It should be observed that this arrangement contained the germs of much
that was afterwards reproduced in Gothic churches.The upper gallery,
after many modifications, at last settled into a triforium, and the
pierced stone slabs in the windows became tracery—but before these were
reached a vaulted roof was introduced, and with it all the features of
the style were to a great extent modified.Lorenzo (fuori le
Mura).]Pudentiana is one of the very oldest
and consequently one of the most interesting of those in Rome.It stands
on substructions of ancient Roman date, which probably formed part of
the Thermæ of Novatus or the house of the Senator Pudens, who is
mentioned by St.Paul at the end of his Second Epistle to Timothy, and
with whom he is traditionally said to have resided during his sojourn in
Rome.The vaults beneath the church certainly formed part of a Roman
mansion, so apparently do those buildings, shown on the plan, and placed
behind and on one side of the sanctuary; but whether these were used for
Christian purposes before the erection of the church in the fourth
century is by no means certain.In plan the church remains in all
probability very much as originally designed, its most striking
peculiarity being the segmental form of the apse, which may possibly
have arisen from some peculiar arrangement of the original building.It
was not, however, found to be pleasing in an architectural point of
view, and was not consequently again employed.The annexed section probably represents very nearly the original form of
the nave, though it has been so encrusted with modern accretions as to
render it difficult to ascertain what the first form really was.The
shafts of the pillars may have been borrowed from some older edifice,
but the capitals were clearly designed to support arches, and must
therefore be early Christian (fourth century?), and are among the most
elegant and appropriate specimens of the class now extant.In some instances, as in San Clemente, above alluded to, in San Pietro
in Vincula, and Sta.Maria in Cosmedin, the colonnade is divided into
spaces of three or four intercolumniations by piers of solid masonry,
which give great apparent solidity and strength to the building, but at
the expense of breaking it up into compartments more than is agreeable,
and these destroy that beauty of perspective so pleasing in a continuous
colonnade.This defect seems to have been felt in the Santa Praxede,
where three of these piers are introduced in the length of the
nave,[271] and support each a bold arch thrown across the central aisle.The effect of this might have been most happy, as at San Miniato, near
Florence; but it has been so clumsily managed in the Roman example, as
to be most destructive of all beauty of proportion.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Church of San
Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Some of the principal beauties as well as some of the most remarkable
defects of these basilican churches arise from the employment of columns
torn from ancient temples: where this has been done, the beauty of the
marble, and the exquisite sculpture of the capitals and friezes, give a
richness and elegance to the whole that go far to redeem or to hide the
rudeness of the building in which they are encased.But, on the other
hand, the discrepancy between the pillars—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
columns being sometimes used side by side—destroys all uniformity, and
the fragmentary character of the entablatures they support is still more
prejudicial to the continuity of the perspective, which should be the
greatest charm of these churches.By degrees, the fertile quarries of
ancient Rome seem to have become entirely exhausted; and as the example
of St.Paul’s proves, the Romans in the fourth century were incapable of
manufacturing even a bad imitation, and were at last forced to adopt
some new plan of supporting their arcades.Nereo ed
Achilleo is, perhaps, the most elegant example of this class, the piers
being light octagons; but the most characteristic, as well as the most
original, is the San Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane, shown in section and
elevation in Woodcut No.It so far deviates from the usual
basilican arrangements as to suggest a later date.It has the same
defect as all the rest—its pier arches being too low, and for which
there is no excuse here—but both internally and externally it shows a
uniformity of design and a desire to make every part ornamental that
produces a very pleasing effect, notwithstanding that the whole is
merely of brick, and that ornament is so sparingly applied as barely to
prevent the building sinking into the class of mere utilitarian
erections.Among the most pleasing architectural features, if they may be so
called, of these churches, are the mosaic pavements that adorn the
greater number.These were always original, being designed for the
buildings in which they are used, and following the arrangement of the
architecture surrounding them.The patterns too are always elegant, and
appropriate to the purpose; and as the colours are in like manner
generally harmoniously blended, they form not only a most appropriate
but most beautiful basement to the architecture.A still more important feature was the great mosaic picture that always
adorned the semi-dome of the apse, representing most generally the
Saviour seated in glory surrounded by saints, or else some scene from
the life of the holy personage to whom the church was dedicated.These mosaics were generally continued down to nearly the level of the
altar, and along the whole of the inner wall of the sanctuary in which
the apse was situated, and as far as the triumphal arch which separated
the nave from the sanctuary, at which point the mosaic blended with the
frescoes that adorned the upper walls of the central nave above the
arcades.All this made up an extent of polychromatic decoration which in
those dark ages, when few could read, the designers of these buildings
seem to have considered as virtually of more importance than the
architectural work to which it was attached.Any attempt to judge of the
one without taking into consideration the other, would be forming an
opinion on hearing but half the evidence; but taken in conjunction, the
paintings go far to explain, and also to redeem, many points in which
the architecture is most open to criticism.During the whole period of the development of early Christian
architecture in Rome, the city of Ravenna, owing to her close connection
with the Eastern empire, almost rivalled in importance the old capital
of the world, and her churches were consequently hardly less important
either in number or in richness than those we have just been describing.It is true she had none so large as the great metropolitan basilicas of
St.The one five-aisled church she possessed—the
cathedral—has been entirely destroyed, to make way for a very
contemptible modern erection.From the plans, however, which we possess
of it, it seems to have differed very considerably from the Roman
examples, most especially in having no trace of a transept, the building
being a perfectly regular parallelogram, half as long again as its
breadth, and with merely one great apse added at the end of the central
nave.Its loss is the more to be regretted, as it was, besides being the
largest, the oldest church in the city, having been erected about the
year 400, by Archbishop Ursus.The baptistery that belonged to it has
been fortunately preserved, and will be described hereafter.Besides a considerable number of other churches which have either been
lost or destroyed by repair, Ravenna still possesses two first-class
three-aisled basilicas—the San Apollinare Nuovo,[272] originally an
Arian church, built by Theodoric, king of the Goths (A.D.493-525); and
the S. Apollinare in Classe, at the Port of Ravenna, situated about
three miles from the city, commenced A.D.538, and dedicated 549 A.D.Of
the two, the first-named is by far the more considerable, being 315 ft.long by 115 in width externally, while the other only measures 216 ft.As will be seen by the plan, S. Apollinare in Classe
is a perfectly regular basilica with twelve pillars on each side of the
nave, which is 50 ft.The apse is raised to allow of a crypt
underneath, and externally it is polygonal, like the Byzantine apse.Arches in Church of San Apollinare Nuovo.[273])]

The great merit of these two basilicas, as compared with those of Rome,
arises from the circumstance of Ravenna having possessed no ruined
temples whose spoils could be used in the construction of new buildings.On the other hand the Goths had no architectural forms of their own; the
architects and workmen therefore who were brought over from
Constantinople reproduced the style with which they were best acquainted
in the East, with such alterations in plan as the liturgies of the
church required, such modifications in construction as the materials of
the country necessitated, and such ideas in architectural design as were
suggested by the examples in Rome with which Theodoric was well
acquainted, having not only restored some of the churches there, but
insisted that the primitive style should be adhered to.The simple
basilican form of church with nave, and aisles without galleries over,
and a single apse, was based on numerous examples existing in Rome, to
which source may be ascribed the external blind arcades of the aisle and
nave walls.[274] From Woodcut 410, representing the arches of the nave
of St.Apollinare Nuovo, it will be seen that an elegance of proportion
is revealed and a beauty of design shown in the details of the
capitals[275] and the dosserets which surmount them, which are quite
foreign to any Roman examples.The great triforium frieze above the
arches, and the wall space above them between the clerestory windows,
covered with mosaics, executed 570 A.D.by Greek artists from
Constantinople, suggest a completeness of design which had not been
reached in Rome.All this is still more apparent in Woodcut No.411,
taken from the arcade where the nave joins the apse in St.Apollinare in
Classe, which shows a further advance in the working out of a new style,
based partially on Roman work, but carried out by Byzantine artists.Part of Apse in S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.Externally these buildings appear to have remained to the present hour
almost wholly without architectural embellishment.It was considered
sufficient for ornamental purposes to make the brick arches necessary
for the construction slightly more prominent and important than was
actually required.As if impelled by some feeling of antagonism to the
practice of the heathens, the early Christians seem to have tried to
make the external appearance of their buildings as unlike those of their
predecessors as was possible.Whether this was the cause or not, it is
certain that nothing can well be less ornamental than these exteriors;
and even the _narthex_,[276] which in the Apollinare in Classe afforded
an excellent opportunity for embellishment, could not be less ornamental
if it were the entrance to a barn instead of to a church of such
richness and beauty as this in all its internal arrangements.The restoration of portions of the Cathedral of St.Mark during the past
twenty years, and the careful examination of various documents in the
archives of that city have led to the discovery that the work attributed
to Doge Pietro Orseolo, 976-78, consisted mainly in the re-construction
of the basilican church erected by the Doge Jean Participazio in 829-32,
and burnt in 976.Mark the
Evangelist, brought from Alexandria in 828 (when the Mohametans pulled
down the church of St.Mark in that town), determined Jean’s brother
Justinian to build a church which should be worthy of their reception.He died, however, before the work was commenced, but left a large sum of
money for the purpose.This church was built on the old site situated
between the Ducal Palace and the church of St.Theodore, which, up to
that time, had served as the Ducal chapel.The width of the church would
seem to have been the same as that of the present nave and aisles.Its
west end formed part of the existing wall behind the present vestibule,
but some difference of opinion seems to exist as to its eastern end, and
whether it coincided with the actual apses.Though nominally built in
976-78 the decoration of Orseolo’s church was probably carried on in
succeeding years, and much of the sculptural work in the present
building dates from the first half of the 11th century.In 1063, under
the Doge Domenico Contarini, the church of St.Theodore, according to M.
Cattaneo,[277] was pulled down and some of its materials used in the new
cathedral.Portions also of the Ducal Palace were destroyed to give
increased space on the south side for the Transept, the portion known as
the Treasury only being preserved.[278] The record of the new church
states that it was built similar in its artistic construction to that at
Constantinople erected in honour of the twelve apostles.[279] The
arrangement and the design of the church thus extended were probably due
to a Greek architect, though much of the work, according to M. Cattaneo,
was afterwards carried out by a Lombard sculptor, Mazulo, who designed
the atrium and tower of the abbey of Pomposa (about 30 miles from
Venice), where the carving is of the same character or style as that in
St.across the transepts; externally these dimensions are increased
to 260 × 215, and the whole area to about 46,000 square ft., so that
although of respectable dimensions it is by no means a large church.The
central and western dome are 42 ft.They are carried on spherical pendentives resting on circular
barrel vaults about 15 ft.extends under
the eastern dome and apses, the vault being supported by fifty-six
monolithic columns 5 ft.high: the whole height from floor to the
crown of the arch being under 9 ft.The construction of this crypt
probably followed the erection of the church, which was not consecrated
till 1111, when Ordelapo Faliero was Doge.Externally this apse is
polygonal, as in Byzantine churches, the upper storey being set back to
allow of a passage round.The narthex or vestibule in front of the
church, which extends also on north and south of the nave aisles up to
the transepts, and the rooms over the north narthex and over part of the
baptistery, must have followed the erection of the church; in fact, the
principal front could not have been completed without them.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali di Europa.’)]

Externally the original construction was in brick, with blind arcades,
niches, and a simple brick cornice such as is found in Lombardic work.It was not till the commencement of the 13th century that the decoration
of the front and sides with marble was undertaken; the arches were
encased with marble slabs carried on ranges of columns, those of the
narthex being placed one above the other.The shafts, capitals and bases
were brought from other buildings, having been imported from Altinum,
Aquileia, Heraclea, Ravenna, and from other places in Dalmatia, Syria,
and the East.It is possible that the porches of the churches of St.Trophime at Arles may have suggested this method of
decoration, of which no prototype exists in the East.The capitals are
of all periods, from the 4th to the 11th centuries, the entablature
blocks and the stylobates being specially worked for the building.The
rose window of the south transept and others of similar style were
inserted about the commencement of the 14th century, the baptistery and
the chapel of St.Isidore[280] being encased with marbles in the middle
of the same century, and the decoration of the upper part of the arches
of the west, towards the end of the 14th century.As will be seen by the
north and south fronts section (Woodcut No.416) the original brick
domes were surmounted by timber domes covered with lead, and of
considerable height.These were probably added in the middle of the 13th
century.[281] The rood loft dates from the end of the same century.The
earlier mosaics in the domes date from the 12th century, and the marble
casing of the lower portion of the walls and the richly decorated
pavement from the 12th and 13th centuries.The work of decoration was
carried on through succeeding centuries with occasional restorations, so
that the church itself constitutes a museum with almost every phase of
work in mosaic from the 12th to the 18th centuries.Though from a strictly architectural point of view the disposition of
the design is not equal to those of some of our northern cathedrals
(except perhaps for the greater beauty of Byzantine domical
construction), it is impossible to find fault with plain surfaces when
they are covered with such exquisite gold mosaics as those of St.Mark’s, or with the want of accentuation in the lines of the roof, when
every part of it is more richly adorned in this manner than any other
church of the Western world.Then too the rood screens, the pulpit, the
pala d’oro and the whole furniture of the choir are so rich, so
venerable, and on the whole so beautiful, and seen in so exquisitely
subdued a light, that it is impossible to deny that it is perhaps the
most impressive interior in Western Europe.Front at Périgueux, with
almost identical dimensions and design (Woodcut No.562), is cold,
scattered, and unmeaning, because but a structural skeleton of St.Mark’s without its adornments.The interior of a 13th-century Gothic
church is beautiful, even when whitewashed; but these early attempts had
not yet reached that balance between construction and ornament, which is
necessary to real architectural effect.The same is true of the exterior; if stripped of its ornament and
erected in plain stone it would hardly be tolerable, and the mixture of
florid 14th-century foliage and bad Italian Gothic details with the
older work, would be all but unendurable.But marble, mosaic, sculpture,
and the all-hallowing touch of age and association, disarm the critic,
and force him to worship when his reason tells him he ought to blame.Mark’s must have been admired in the days of its freshness,
the Gothic feeling seems to have been so strong in Northern Italy in the
11th and 12th centuries as to prevent its being used as a model.The one
prominent exception is San Antonio, Padua (1237-1307), which is
evidently a copy of St.Mark’s, but with so much Gothic design mixed up
with it as to spoil both.Length was sought to be obtained by using
seven domes instead of five, and running an aisle round the apse.The
side-aisles were covered with intersecting vaults, and pointed arches
were occasionally introduced when circular would have harmonised better
with the general design.Externally the enveloping porch was omitted—not even the Pisan
modification of it introduced, though it might have been employed with
the happiest effect.The consequence of all this jumble is, that San
Antonio is externally one of the most unsatisfactory churches in Europe,
though possessing a quaint Oriental look from the grouping of its dome
with the minaret-like spires which adorn it.The inside is not so bad,
though a roof of only five bays over a quasi-Gothic church, 200 ft.in
length, distorts the proportion, and with the ill-understood details of
the whole, spoils what narrowly escaped being one of the most successful
interiors of that part of Italy.Both Dalmatia and Istria formed part of the Gothic kingdom of Theodoric:
we find therefore the same Byzantine influence exerted as in Ravenna; an
influence which increased when the first-named country was retaken by
Justinian in 535, and the second in 539 A.D.At Parenzo in Istria there is a basilica, built in the year 543 A.D.by
the Bishop Euphrasius, and consequently contemporary with the examples
at Ravenna already described.This church still retains its atrium,
baptistery, and other accompaniments, which those at Ravenna have lost.It consists of a basilica in three aisles, with an apse at the end of
each, and an atrium in front, beyond which is situated the baptistery;
and in front of this again a tower, though this latter feature seems to
be of more modern date.On one side at the east end is a chapel or
crypt; this, Mr.Jackson[282] suggests, may have been “the martyrium or
confessio of the basilica where the remains of the saintly patrons of
the church were preserved and venerated.” “According to strict rule,”
Mr.Jackson observes, “the confessio should be in a crypt under the
choir as at Aquileja and Zara, but Parenzo lies so low that excavation
would be difficult, and here as in other cases the martyrium may have
been placed in an adjoining building.”[283]

Internally the church is 121 ft.in length by 32 in width, and possesses
all the usual arrangements of a church of that date.The columns are
borrowed from some earlier edifice, but the capitals are all original,
and were carved for the church.They are all of pure Byzantine type, and
are surmounted by that essentially Byzantine feature the dosseret.The
central apse, though circular inside, is polygonal outside, which is
another characteristic of Byzantine work.Like Torcello it has still
preserved its semicircle of marble seats for the clergy, with the
episcopal throne in the middle.Externally the façade retains portions
of the ancient mosaics with which it was decorated, and although
internally the nave has lost its early decorations, the lofty dado of
the apse inlaid with slabs of porphyry and serpentine interspersed with
mosaics of opaque glass, onyx and mother-of-pearl, bears witness to its
original splendour, the cypher of Euphrasius denoting its execution to
be coeval with the building of the church, and therefore some centuries
earlier than the mosaics of the baldachino, which are dated 1277.Church at Parenzo in Istria.Jackson for the description of two churches
at Grado: the Duomo and St.Maria delle Grazie; the former a fine
basilican church with nave and aisles and a deep central apse, circular
inside and polygonal externally.[284] The twenty columns of the nave are
all taken from earlier edifices, and of the capitals which surmount them
five are Roman and twelve of pure Byzantine workmanship, based on the
Roman composite capital, but treated in a quite original way.The
capitals are not surmounted by the dosseret, but in the other church of
St.Maria delle Grazie some have the dosseret and others are without it,
though all of the same period.The chief glory of the church, however,
lies in its magnificent marble pavement (measured and illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work), the greater portion of which is still preserved.Maria delle Grazie is a small basilican church of six bays
with fragments of similar pavement to those in the Duomo.The apse here
is masked on the exterior by two sacristies on each side which entirely
enclose it; similar examples are found in De Vogüé’s work of “Central
Syria” (Woodcuts Nos.The churches of Parenzo and Grado appear to be the only examples
remaining of early Romano-Byzantine work on this side of the Adriatic.Maria de Canneto at Pola, consecrated in 546 A.D., was destroyed in
the 14th and 15th centuries and its materials carried off to Venice for
the adornment of the churches there.As edifices of the age of
Justinian, and as showing the relative position of the various parts
that made up an ecclesiastical establishment in those early times, the
churches of Parenzo and Grado are singularly deserving of the attention
of those to whom the history of art is a matter of interest.The church at Torcello, in the Venetian Lagune, is the last example it
will be necessary to quote in order to make the arrangements of the
early basilicas intelligible.It was originally erected in the seventh
century; of this church, according to M. Cattaneo, the only portion
remaining, if we except a fragment of the ancient baptistery, is the
central apse.In 864, the church would seem to have been reconstructed,
and to this period belong the two side apses, the apsidal crypt with new
windows pierced through the old wall and the external walls: it is
possible that the original nave of the seventh century was retained till
1008, when it was rebuilt by the Doge Pietro Orseolo, on the occasion of
his son being raised to the Bishopric of Torcello.Thirteen of the
capitals of the nave date from this period, one may be earlier, and five
belong to the second half of the 12th century.The whole width of the
church is 71 ft.A screen of six pillars
divides the nave from the sanctuary.Perhaps, however, the most
interesting part of this church is the interior of its apse, which still
retains the bishop’s throne, surrounded by six ranges of seats for his
presbytery, arranged like those of an ancient theatre.It presents one
of the most extensive and best preserved examples of the fittings of the
apse, and gives a better idea of the mode in which the apses of churches
were originally arranged than anything that is to be found in any other
church, either of its age or of an earlier period.404), this church possesses a small
side chapel, a vestry or sanctuary, on the Gospel side of the altar, and
the remains of the ancient baptistery may still be traced in front of
the west door.This was a square block, externally, measuring 37 ft.each way; internally an octagon, with the angles cut into hemispherical
niches.A portion of its eastern side only remains, and this is now
hidden behind the modern baptistery, in which, under a board in the
pavement, can be seen the foundations of the second baptistery of the
12th century.In the rear of the church stood the campanile, and across
a narrow passage the conventual buildings; in front of which now stands
the beautiful little church of Sta.Fosca, the whole making up a group
of nearly unrivalled interest considering its small dimensions.Other examples might be quoted differing in some slight respect from
those just given, but the above are probably sufficient to explain the
general arrangements of the early basilican churches and the style of
their architecture, so long as this worked on the old tradition of the
Romano-Byzantine style; in other words, so long as it continued in Italy
to be a distinction from the Roman style without any foreign admixture
beyond that introduced direct from Byzantium.It might be instructive to
speculate on what the style might have become if left alone to develope
itself on its native soil, but it would be extremely difficult to make
the subject clear without a much larger amount of illustration than is
admissible, and which in such a history as this would be out of place.Simultaneously with the elaboration of the rectangular form of church by
the Italians, the Byzantines were occupied with the same task; but,
being freer from the trammels of tradition and less influenced by
examples, they early arrived at forms much more divergent from those of
the classical period than those of Italy, and their style, reacting on
the Italian, produced that very beautiful combination of which Pisa
Cathedral is a type, and St.Mark’s at Venice an extreme example.This
style generally pervaded the whole south of Italy, with the exception of
Rome; and, from the elements of which it was composed, may fairly be
designated Byzantine Italian.Apse of Basilica at Torcello.]While this was going on in the south, the Longobards, and other
Barbarians who invaded the north of Italy, seized on this type and
worked it out in their own fashion.They, however, conceived the desire
to give a more permanent character to their churches by covering them
over with stone vaulted roofs, which led to most important modifications
of the style.It may probably be correct to assert that no
Romano-Byzantine or early Romanesque church has, or ever had, a vaulted
nave.On the other hand, there is hardly a Barbarian church which the
builders did not aspire to vault, though they were frequently unable to
accomplish it.It was this vaulting mania which led to the invention of
compound piers, pointed arches, buttresses, pinnacles, and all the
numerous peculiarities of the Gothic style; and which, reacting on
northern Italy, produced the Ghibelline or Italian-Gothic style.No exact boundary can be drawn between these two: modifications of style
varied, as Byzantine or Gothic influences ebbed or flowed, during the
Middle Ages.Venice and Pisa, and all Calabria, were generally
influenced by their intercourse with the East, while the whole of the
north of Italy and away from the coast as far down as Sienna and Orvieto
the strong hand of the Teuton made itself felt.Yet Italy cannot be said to have been successful in either style.Her
superior civilisation enabled her to introduce and use an elegance of
detail unknown north of the Alps; but she did not work out the basilican
type for herself: she left it to others to do that for her, and
consequently never perfectly understood what she undertook, or why it
was done.The result is that, though great elegance is found in parts,
Italy can hardly produce a single church which is satisfactory as a
design; or which would be intelligible without first explaining the
basework of those true styles from which its principal features have
been borrowed.Costanza—Churches at Perugia, Nocera,
  Ravenna, Milan—Secular Buildings.In addition to the Pagan basilicas and temples, from which the
arrangements of so many of the Christian edifices were obtained, the
tombs of the Romans formed a third type, from which the forms of a very
important class of churches were derived.The form which these buildings retained, so long as they remained mere
sepulchres appropriated to Pagan uses, has been already described (pp.That of Cæcilia Metella and those of Augustus and Hadrian
were what would now be called “chambered tumuli;” originally the
sepulchral chamber was infinitesimally small as compared with the mass,
but we find these being gradually enlarged till we approach the age of
Constantine, when, as in the tombs of the Tossia Family, that called the
Tomb of Helena (Woodcut No.227) and many others of the same age, they
became miniature Pantheons.The central apartment was all in all; the
exterior was not thought of.Still they were appropriated to sepulchral
rites, and these only, so long as they belonged to Pagan Rome.The case
was different when they were erected by the Christians.No association
could be more appropriate than that of these sepulchral edifices, to a
religion nursed in persecution, and the apostles of which had sealed
their faith with their blood as martyrs; and when the Sacrament for the
dying and the burial service were employed, it was in these circular
churches that it was performed.But besides the viaticum for the
departing Christian, the Church provided the admission sacrament of
baptism for those who were entering into communion, and this was, in
early days at least, always performed in a building separate from the
basilica.It would depend on whether marriage was then considered as a
sacrament or a civil contract, whether it was celebrated in the basilica
or the church; but it seems certain that the one was used almost
exclusively as the business place of the community, the other as the
sacramental temple of the sect.This appears always to have been the
case, at least when the two forms existed together, as they almost
always did in the great ecclesiastical establishments of Italy.When the
church was copied from a temple, as in the African examples above
described, it is probable it may have served both purposes.But too
little is known of the architecture of this early age, and its
liturgies, to speak positively on the subject.The uses and derivation of these three forms of churches are so distinct
that it would be extremely convenient if we could appropriate names to
distinguish them.The first retains most appropriately the name of
basilica, and with sufficient limitation to make it generally
applicable.The word _ecclesia_, or _église_, would equally suffice for
the second but that it is not English, and has been so indiscriminately
applied that it could not now be used in a restricted sense.The word
kirk, or as we soften it into church, would be appropriate to the
third,[286] but again it has been so employed as to be inapplicable.We
therefore content ourselves with employing the words Basilica, Church,
and Round Church, to designate the three, employing some expletive when
any confusion is likely to arise between the first two of the series.The most interesting feature of the early Romanesque circular buildings
is that they show the same transitional progress from an external to an
internal columnar style of architecture which marked the change from the
Pagan to the Christian form of sacred edifice.It is perhaps not too
much to assert that no ancient classic building of circular form has any
pillars used constructively in its interior.[287] Even the Pantheon,
though 143 ft.in diameter, derives no assistance from the pillars
that surround it internally—they are mere decorative features.The same
is true of the last Pagan example we are acquainted with—the temple or
tomb which Diocletian erected in his palace at Spalato (Woodcut No.The pillars do fill up the angles there, but the building would be
stable without them.The Byzantine architects also generally declined to
avail themselves of pillars to support their domes, but the Romanesque
architects used them almost as universally as in their basilicas.Another very striking peculiarity is the entire abandonment of all
external decoration.Roman circular temples had peristyles, like those
at Tivoli (Woodcut No.193) and that of Vesta in Rome.Even the Pantheon
is as remarkable for its portico as its dome, so is that known as the
Torre dei Schiavi,[288] but it is only in the very earliest of the
Christian edifices that we find a trace of the portico, and even in them
hardly any attempt at external decoration.The temples of the Christians
were no longer shrines to contain statues and to which worship might be
addressed by people outside, but had become halls to contain the
worshippers themselves while engaged in acts of devotion.The tomb of the Empress Helena (Woodcut No.227) is one of the earliest
examples of its class.It has no pillars internally, it is true, but it
likewise has none on the exterior—the transition was not then complete.The same is the case with the two tombs on the Spina of the Circus of
Nero (Woodcut No.They too were astylar, and their external
appearance was utterly neglected.When from these we turn to the Tomb or Baptistery of Constantine, built
some time afterwards (Woodcut No.422), we find the roof supported by a
screen of eight columns, two storeys in height, and through all its
alterations can detect the effort to make the interior ornamental.It
has, however, a portico, but this again is practically an interior, both
ends being closed with apsidal terminations, so that it really forms a
second apartment, rather than a portico.In both these respects it is in
advance of the building next to it in age that we know of—the Octagon at
Spalato—which it otherwise very much resembles.The eight internal
pillars instead of being mere ornaments have become essential parts of
the construction, and the external peristyle has disappeared, leaving
only the fragment of a porch.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The tomb which the same Emperor erected to contain the remains of his
daughter Constantia, is another example of the same transitional style.The interior in this instance is vaulted, but so timidly that
twenty-four pillars are employed to sustain a weight for which half that
number would have been amply sufficient.In the square niche opposite
the entrance stood the sarcophagus of the princess, now in the Vatican.The roof of the aisle is adorned with paintings of the vintage and
scenes of rural life, which, like all those on the tombs of Pagan Rome,
have no reference to the sepulchral uses to which the building was
dedicated.The whole internal diameter of the tomb is 73 ft., that of
the dome 35.In front of the building is a small crypto-porticus similar in
arrangement to that of her father’s tomb, and beyond this is an oblong
space with circular ends, and surrounded on all sides by arcades; its
dimensions were 535 ft.by 130, and, though so ruined as hardly to allow
of its arrangements being restored, it is interesting as being perhaps
the only instance of the “_forum_,” which it is probable was left before
all tombs in those times, and traces of which may perhaps be found
elsewhere, though as yet they have not been looked for.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)The only other important circular building within the walls of Rome of
this early age is that known as S. Stefano Rotondo.Though there is
nothing to fix its date with any precision, it is almost certain that it
belongs to the fifth century of the Christian era.in
diameter, and its roof was supported by two ranges of columns,
circularly disposed in its interior; and on the first or inner range
rested a horizontal architrave like that of St.In the outer
one the pillars support arches like those of St.[290] All the
pillars are taken from older buildings.The outer aisle was divided into
eight compartments; but in what manner, and for what purpose, it is not
now easy to ascertain, owing to the ruined state of the building, and to
its having been so much and so frequently altered since it was first
erected.Nor can it be determined exactly how it was roofed; though it
is probable that its arrangements were identical with those of the great
five-aisled basilicas, which it closely resembles, except in its
circular shape.This is more clear in another church of the same age, that of Sti.Angeli, at Perugia, which is very similar in its disposition.Of this
building a section is here shown, as given by M. Isabelle—perhaps not
quite to be depended upon in every respect, but still affording a very
fair representation of what the arrangements of the circular wooden
roofed churches were.Its dimensions are much less than those of San
Stefano, being only 115 ft.in diameter; but it is more regular, the
greater part of its materials being apparently original, and made for
the place they occupy.In the church of San Stefano, the tomb-shaped
circular form was probably used as symbolical of his martyrdom.That at
Perugia was most likely originally a baptistery, or it may also have
been dedicated to some martyr; but in the heart of Etruria this form may
have been adopted for other reasons, the force of which we are hardly
able at the present day to appreciate, though in all cases locality is
one of the strongest influencing powers in so far as architectural forms
are concerned.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Plan of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.Double the
usual scale, or 50 ft.At Nocera dei Pagani, on the road between Naples and Salerno, there is
an extremely beautiful circular church, built undoubtedly for the
purpose of a baptistery, and very similar in plan and general
arrangement to the tomb of Constantia, now known as the Baptistery of
Sta.Agnese, though somewhat larger being 80 ft.Its
principal merit is the form of its dome, which is not only correct in a
scientific point of view, but singularly graceful internally.Externally
this building for the first time introduces us to a peculiarity which
had as much influence on the western styles as any of those pointed out
above.540), the early Romanesque architects
never attempted to vault their rectangular buildings, but they did
frequently construct domes over their circular edifices.But here again
they did not make the outside of the dome the outline of their
buildings, as the Romans had always done before the time of Constantine,
and as the Byzantines and Saracens invariably did afterwards; but they
employed their vault only as a ceiling internally, and covered it, as in
this instance, with a false wooden roof externally.It may be difficult
to determine how far this was a judicious innovation; but this at least
is certain, that it had as much influence on the development of the
Gothic style as the vaulting mania itself.In the 10th and 11th
centuries many attempts were made to construct true roofs of stone, but
unsuccessfully; and from various causes, which will be pointed out
hereafter, the idea was abandoned, and the architects were forced to
content themselves with a stone ceiling, covered by a wooden roof,
though this became one of the radical defects of the style, and one of
the principal causes of the decay and destruction of so many beautiful
buildings.Section of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Ravenna possesses several circular buildings, almost as interesting as
those of the capital; the first being the baptistery of St.John
belonging to the original basilica, and consequently one of the oldest
Christian buildings of the place.Externally it is a plain octagonal
building, 40 ft.Internally it still retains its mosaic and
other internal features added in the 5th century, which are singularly
elegant and pleasing.Its design is somewhat like that of the temple at
Spalato, but with arcades substituted everywhere for horizontal
architraves; the century that elapsed between these two epochs having
sufficed to complete the transition between the two styles.Far more interesting than this is the great church of St.Vitale, the
most complicated, and at the same time, perhaps, the most beautiful, of
the circular churches of that age.In design it is nearly identical with
the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople (see Woodcut No.311), from
which it was undoubtedly copied, and probably by Greek artists from that
town.It was built in the reign of Justinian by St.Ecclesius,
archbishop of the see, and was consecrated in 547, eight years after the
taking of Ravenna by Justinian’s generals.The principal difference of
the plan lies in its being enclosed within an octagon instead of a
square, as in St.Sergius, probably to mask the irregularity of the main
entrance from a street which did not run in the direction of any of the
cardinal points.The recesses are loftier in proportion than those of
St.Sergius, and in the lower storey arcades take the place of beams.The aisles being covered with timber roofs, it was necessary to raise
the walls of the octagon higher than those of St.Sergius, and small
arches take the place of the usual pendentives: the springing of the
dome, which is 50 ft.in diameter, is on the level of the sill of the
windows the arches of which therefore form penetrations into the dome.The church is built in bricks with thick mortar joints, the dome being
constructed in an ingenious manner with hollow pots fitted the end of
one into the mouth of the other; the lightness of this vault has enabled
the builders to dispense with the immense arches and buttresses found in
St.Similar construction with pots had been
employed in the East for domes and roofs,[291] and they form as
permanent a method as stone itself, in addition to the stability,
facility of construction, and lightness which such an expedient affords.Internally a good deal has been done in modern times to destroy the
simplicity of the original effect of the building; but still there is a
pleasing result produced by alternating the piers with circular columns,
and a lightness and elegance about the whole design that render it
unrivalled in the western world among churches of its class.This seems
to have been admitted by its contemporaries as much as it is in modern
times.Charlemagne at all events copied it for his own tomb at
Aix-la-Chapelle, and the architects of many other circular buildings of
that age appear to have derived their inspiration from this one.The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, had it not been so much altered in
modern times, would take precedence of San Vitale in almost every
respect.The date of its erection is not known, though it certainly must
be as early as, if not earlier than, the time of Justinian.Down to the
8th century it was the cathedral of the city.It was burnt to the ground
in 1071, and restored in 1119; the dome then erected fell in 1571, on
which it underwent its last transformation from the hands of Martino
Bassi and Pellegrini, who so disfigured its ancient details as to lead
many modern inquirers to doubt whether it was really so old as it was
said to be.Its plan, however, seems to have remained unchanged, and shows a further
progress towards what afterwards became the Byzantine style than is to
be found either in St.It is in fact the
earliest attempt to amalgamate the circular church with one of a square
shape; and except that the four lateral colonnades are flat segments of
circles, and that there is a little clumsiness in the angles (due
possibly to the additions made in 1119 and 1571, when the plan of the
dome was changed to an octagon, the original dome being probably
circular, and carried on four spherical pendentives), it is one of the
most successful designs handed down from that early age.The dome as it now stands is octagonal, which the first dome certainly
could not have been.Its diameter is 70 ft., nearly equal to that of the
Minerva Medica, and the whole diameter of the building is internally 142
ft.(From Quast,
‘Altchristlichen,’ &c.)In front of the church, in the street, is a handsome colonnade of
pillars, borrowed from some ancient temple—it is said from one dedicated
to Hercules; this leads to a square atrium, now wholly deprived of its
lateral arcades; and this again to a façade, which has been strangely
altered in modern times.Opposite this, to the eastward of the church,
is an octagonal building, apparently intended as a tomb-house; and on
the north side a similar one, though smaller.On the south is the
baptistery, about 45 ft.in diameter, approached by a vestibule in the
same manner as that of Constantine at Rome, and as in the tomb of his
daughter Constantia: all these, however, have been so painfully altered,
that little remains besides the bare plan of the building; still there
is enough to show that this is one of the oldest and most interesting of
the Christian churches of Italy.The building now known as the baptistery at Florence is an octagon, 108
ft.Like the last-mentioned church, it was
originally the cathedral of the city, and was erected to serve as such
apparently in the time of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.If this
was so, it certainly had not originally its present form, and most
probably those columns which now stand ranged round the walls at that
time stood in the centre, as in the Roman examples.If the original roof
was of wood, it was probably in two storeys, like that of the baptistery
of Constantine, or it may have been a dome of more solid materials, like
that of the Sta.At the same time when the new cathedral was built, the older edifice
appears to have been remodelled both internally and externally by
Arnolpho da Lapo, and both its form and decoration so completely
changed, that it must now be considered rather as a building of the 13th
century than of the 6th, in which it seems originally to have been
erected.[292]

[Illustration: 433.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Baptistery at
Novara.The baptistery of Novara, which may date from the time of Charlemagne,
is interesting in that it contains the germ of those external galleries
under the roof which form not only one of the most common but also one
of the most beautiful features of the later Lombard and Rhenish
churches.433) it will easily be seen
what was the motive and use of this arrangement, the first trace of
which dates perhaps as far back as the baptistery of Nocera (Woodcut No.428); for wherever a wooden roof was placed over a circular vault, it is
evident that the external walls must be carried up higher than the
springing of the arch.But it was by no means necessary that this
additional wall should be so solid as that below it, and it was
necessary to introduce light and air into the space between the stone
and the wooden roofs.Add to this the incongruity of effect in placing a
light tiled wooden roof on a massive solid wall, and it will be evident
that not only did the exigencies of the building, but the true
principles of taste, demand that this part should be made as light as
possible.Such openings as those found in the baptistery at Novara
suggested an expedient which provided for these objects.This was
afterwards carried to a much greater extent.At first, however, it seems
only to have been used under the roofs of the domes with which the
Italians almost universally crowned the intervention of naves and
transepts, and round the semidomes of the apses; but so enamoured did
they afterwards become of this feature, that it is frequently carried
along the sides of the churches under the roof of the nave and of the
aisles, and also—where it is of more questionable taste—under the
sloping naves of the roof of the principal façade.There is nothing in the Lombardian and Rhenish styles so common or so
beautiful as these galleries, the arcades of which have all the shadow
given by a cornice without its inconvenient projection, while the little
shafts with their elegant capitals and light archivolts have a sparkle
and brilliancy which no cornice ever possessed.Indeed so beautiful are
they, that we are not surprised to find them universally adopted; and
their discontinuance on the introduction of the pointed style was one of
the greatest losses sustained by architectural art in those days.It is
true they would have been quite incompatible with the thin walls and
light piers of pointed architecture, but it may be safely asserted that
no feature which these new styles introduced was equally beautiful with
those galleries which they superseded.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.There can be little doubt that many other similar buildings belonging to
this age still exist in various parts of Italy; for it is more than
probable that, at a time when the city was not of sufficient importance,
or the congregation so numerous as to require the more extended
accommodation of the basilica, almost all the earlier churches were
circular.They either, however, have perished from lapse of time, or
have been so altered as to be nearly unrecognisable.We here, in
consequence, come again to a break in the chain of our sequence; and
when we again meet with any circular buildings in Italy, their features
are so distinctly Gothic or Byzantine, that they must be classed with
one or other of these modifications.The true Romano-Byzantine style had
nearly come to an end when Alboin the Lombard had made himself master of
the greater part of Italy about the year 575.Before leaving this branch of the subject there are two small buildings
at Ravenna which it is impossible to pass over, though their direct
bearing on the history of this subject is not so apparent as it is in
the case of other buildings just described.The first and earliest is
the tomb of Galla Placidia (Woodcut No.302), now known as the church of
SS.Nazario and Celso, and must have been erected before the year 450.It is singular among all the tombs of that age from the abandonment in
it of the circular for a cruciform plan.Such forms, it is true, are
common in the chambers of tumuli and also among the catacombs, while the
church which Constantine built in Constantinople and dedicated to the
Apostles, meaning it however as a sepulchral church, was something also
on this plan.Notwithstanding, however, these examples, this must be
considered as an exceptional form, though its diminutiveness (it being
only 35 ft.by 30 internally) might perhaps account for any caprice.Its
great interest to us consists in its retaining not only its primitive
architectural form (which is that of a dome carried on pendentives, and
one of the few instances in which both dome and pendentives form part of
one sphere), but its polychromatic decorations nearly in their original
state of completeness (Woodcut 302).The three arms of the cross forming
the receptacles for the three sarcophagi is certainly a pleasing
arrangement, but is only practicable on a small scale.Capital of Pillars forming peristyle round
Theodoric’s Tomb.Elevation of Tomb of Theodoric, Ravenna.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)]

Far more interesting than this—architecturally at least—is the tomb of
Theodoric, the Gothic king, now known as Santa Maria Rotunda.The lower
storey is a decagon externally, enclosing a cruciform crypt.in diameter, each face being ornamented by a deep niche.These
support a flat terrace, on which originally stood a range of small
pillars supporting arches which surrounded the upper storey.These have
all been removed, though their form can be restored from fragments
found, and as shown in Woodcut No.On the face of the tomb itself
are the sinkings for the architraves and vaults which they supported.The most singular part of the building is the roof, which is formed of
one great slab hollowed out into the form of a flat dome—internally 30
ft.in diameter—and which certainly forms one of
the most unique and appropriate coverings for a tomb perhaps anywhere to
be found.Near the edge are a series of projecting bosses, which
evidently were originally used as handles, by means of which the immense
mass was raised to its present position.In the centre of the dome is a
small square pedestal, on which, it is said, once stood the urn which
contained the ashes of its founder.The model of this building seems probably to have been the Mole of
Hadrian, which Theodoric saw, and must have admired, during his
celebrated visit to Rome.The polygonal arrangements of the exterior,
and the substitution of arcades for horizontal architraves, were only
such changes as the lapse of time had rendered indispensable.But the
building of the ancient world which it most resembles is the Tour Magne
at Nîmes.In both cases we have the polygonal basement containing a
great chamber, and above this externally the narrow ledge, approached by
flying flights of steps.We cannot now tell what crowned the French
example, though the fact of an urn crowning the tomb at Ravenna points
to an identical origin, but we must obtain a greater number of examples
before we can draw any positive conclusions as to the origin of such
forms.Meanwhile, however, whether we consider the appropriateness of
the forms, the solidity of its construction, or the simplicity of its
ornaments and details, this tomb at Ravenna is not surpassed by any
building of its class and age.Though the investigation of the early history of these circular forms of
churches is not so important as that of the rectangular basilicas, it is
extremely interesting from the influence they had on the subsequent
development of the style.In Italy it is probable that one-half of the
early churches were circular in plan; and one such is still generally
retained attached to each cathedral as a baptistery.Except for this
purpose, however, the form has generally been superseded: the
rectangular being much easier to construct, more capable of extension,
and altogether more appropriate to the ritual of the Christian
community.In France the circular form was early absorbed into the
basilica, forming the Chevet or apse.In Germany its fate was much the
same as in Italy, but its supersession was earlier and more complete.In
England some half-dozen examples are known to exist, and in Spain they
have yet to be discovered.Had the Gothic architects applied themselves to the extension and
elaboration of the circular form with the same zeal and skill as was
displayed in that task by their Byzantine brethren, they might probably
have produced something far more beautiful than even the best of our
mediæval cathedrals; but when the Barbarians began to build, they found
the square form with its straight lines simpler and easier to construct.It thus happened that, long before they became as civilised and expert
as the Easterns were when they commenced the task, the Westerns had
worked the rectangular form into one of considerable beauty, and had
adapted it to their ritual, and their ritual to it.It thus became the
sacred and appropriate form, and the circular or domical forms were
consequently never allowed a fair trial in Western Europe.Very few remains of secular buildings in the early Christian style are
now to be found in Italy.The palace of Theodoric at Ravenna, though
sadly mutilated, is perhaps the best and most perfect.In all its
details it shows a close resemblance to that of Diocletian at Spalato,
but more especially so to the Porta Aurea and the most richly and least
classically decorated parts of that edifice, but much intermixed with
mouldings and details which would seem to belong to a later style.Another building, though perhaps of earlier date, is that which is now
called the Palazzo delle Torre at Turin, and which still retains the
architectural ordinance of the exterior of a Roman amphitheatre, but so
modified by common sense that the pilasters are frankly accepted as
purely decorative features, having only a slight projection.A similar
style of work is found at Bordeaux in what is known as the “Palais
Gallien,” but which in reality is a fragment of an amphitheatre built by
the Emperor Gallienus (260-268 A.D.).The example at Turin is built with
brick of large dimensions 15 in.by 11 in., which, coupled with its
character and style, has led M. Cattaneo to ascribe it to the 3rd or 4th
century of our era; the paucity of contemporary examples, however,
renders it extremely difficult to trace the exact history of the style
at this age.Palazzo delle Torre, Turin.(From Osten’s ‘Bauwerke
in der Lombardei.’)]

In so progressive an art as architecture it is always very difficult,
sometimes impossible, to fix the exact date when one style ends and
another begins.In an art so pre-eminently ecclesiastical as
architecture was in those days, it will probably be safer to look in the
annals of the Church rather than in those of the State for a date when
the debased-Roman expired, giving birth, phœnix-like, to the Romanesque.Viewed from this point there can be little doubt but that the reign of
Gregory the Great (A.D.590 to 603) must be regarded as that in which
the Latin language and the Roman style of architecture both ceased to be
generally or even commonly employed.After this date we wander on through five centuries of tentative efforts
to form a new style, and in the age of another Gregory—the VII.—we find
at last the Romanesque style emancipated from former traditions, and
marching steadily forward with a well-defined aim.What had been
commenced under the gentle influence of a Theodelinda at Florence in the
year 600, was completed in the year 1077 under the firmer guidance of a
Matilda at Canossa.LOMBARD AND ROUND-ARCHED GOTHIC.Chapel at Friuli—Churches at Piacenza and Novara—St.Ambrogio, Milan—Cathedral, Piacenza—Churches at Verona—Churches at
  Toscanella—Circular Churches—Towers.When, in the early centuries of the Christian era, the great mass of
Gothic barbarism moved up the Valley of the Danube towards the west, one
great division followed that river to its source, and thence penetrated
into and settled in the Valley of the Rhine.Though sufficiently
numerous to be able almost wholly to obliterate all traces of former
civilisation, they had virtually no style of their own, and it seems
probable that the edifices left by the Romans sufficed for the early
wants of the people.The other great division of the horde turned to the Sömmering Alps and,
penetrating into Italy by way of Udine and Conegliano, settled in the
Valley of the Po.They may have been as numerous as the others; but
Italy in those days was far more densely peopled than Germany, and the
inhabitants were consequently able to resist obliteration far more
successfully than on the north of the Alps, and even where the new
element prevailed most strongly its influence was far less felt than in
the more sparsely-peopled Rhenish provinces.This was generally more
apparent along the coast than in the interior.Venice did not exist, and
Ravenna, though overwhelmed, became the great centre of Romano-Byzantine
art.The
Barbarian influence was strongly felt at Siena, more feebly at Orvieto;
but there it was stopped by the influence of Rome, which throughout the
Middle Ages remained nearly uncontaminated.Notwithstanding the almost insuperable barrier of the Alps which
stretched between them and the different influences to which they were
subjected, the connection between the northern and southern hordes
remained intimate during the whole of the Middle Ages.Milan was as much
German as Italian; and, indeed, except from a slightly superior degree
of elegance in the southern examples, it is sometimes extremely
difficult to distinguish between the designs of Lombard and of Rhenish
churches.As the Middle Ages wore on, however, the breach between the
two styles widened; and there is no difficulty, in the later pointed
schools, in seeing how Italy was gradually working itself free from
German influence, till at last they became distinct and antagonistic
nationalities, practising two styles of art, which had very little in
common the one with the other.Whoever the Barbarians were who in the 5th and 6th centuries swarmed
into Italy—Austro-Goths, Visi-Goths, or Lombards—they certainly did not
belong to any of the great building races of the world.Few people ever
had better opportunities than they of employing their easily-acquired
plunder in architectural magnificence, if they had any taste that way;
but, though we hear everywhere of the foundation of churches and the
endowment of ecclesiastical establishments during the Carlovingian
period, not one important edifice of that age has come down to our time.The monumental history of the early Romanesque style is as essentially a
blank in Italy as it is in Saxon England.One or two circular buildings
remain tolerably entire; some small chapels let us into the secrets of
the style, but not one important edifice of any sort attests the
splendour of the Lombard kingdom of Northern Italy.Aryans they must
have been, and it was not till the beginning of the 11th century, when
their blood was thoroughly mixed with that of the indigenous inhabitants
and a complete fusion of races had taken place, that we find buildings
of a monumental character erected, which have come down to the present
day.Among the smaller monuments of the age none has been preserved more
complete and less altered than the little chapel at Friuli; which,
though extremely small (only 18 ft.by 30 inside the walls), is
interesting, as retaining all its decorations almost exactly as they
were left by Gertrude, duchess of Friuli, who erected it in the 8th
century.It shows considerable elegance in its details, and the
sculpture is far better than it afterwards became, though perhaps its
most remarkable peculiarity is the intersecting vault that covers
it—_pulchre testudinatum_, as the old chronicle terms it.This is one
proof among many, how early that feature was introduced which afterwards
became the formative principle of the whole Gothic style, and was as
essentially its characteristic as the pillars and entablatures of the
five orders were the characteristics of the classical styles of Greece
and Rome.As before remarked, it is this necessity for a stone roof that
was the problem to be solved by the architects, and to accomplish which
the style took almost all those forms which are so much admired in it.From this example of the Carlovingian era we are obliged to pass to the
11th and 12th centuries, the first great building age of the Lombards.It is true that there is scarcely a single important church in Pavia, in
Verona, or indeed in any of the cities of Lombardy, the original
foundation of which cannot be traced back to a much earlier period.Before the canons of architectural criticism were properly understood,
antiquaries were inclined to believe that in the buildings now existing
they saw the identical edifices erected during the period of the Lombard
sway.Either, however, in consequence of the rude construction of the
earlier buildings, or because they were too small or too poor for the
increased population and wealth of the cities at a later period, every
one of the original churches has disappeared and been replaced by a
larger and better-constructed edifice, adorned with all the improvements
which the experience of centuries had introduced into the construction
of religious edifices.Judging from the rudeness of the earliest churches which we know to have
been erected in the 11th century, it is evident that the progress made,
up to that period, was by no means equal to what was accomplished during
the next two centuries.[294]]

This will appear from the plan and section of St.Antonio at Piacenza
(Woodcuts Nos.440 and 440a), built in the first years of the 11th
century, and dedicated in 1014 by Bishop Siegfried.Section of Church of San Antonio at Piacenza.Plan and section of Baptistry at Asti.Its arrangement is somewhat peculiar; the transepts are near the west
end, and the octagonal tower rising from the intersection is supported
on eight pillars, the square being completed by four polygonal piers.The principal point, however, to observe is, how completely the style
has emancipated itself from all Roman tradition.A new style has grown
up as essentially different from the early Christian as the style of
Cologne or of York Cathedral.The architect is once more at liberty to
work out his own designs without reference to anything beyond the
exigencies of the edifices themselves.The plan, indeed, is still a
reminiscence of the Basilica; but so are all the plans of Mediæval
cathedrals, and we may trace back the forms of the pillars, the piers,
and the arches they support, to the preceding style.All these were
derived from Roman art, but the originals are forgotten, and the new
style is wholly independent of the old one.The whole of the church too
is roofed with intersecting vaults, which have become an integral part
of the design, giving it an essentially different character.On the
outside buttresses are introduced—timidly, it is true, but so
frequently, as to make it evident that already there existed no
insuperable objection to increase either their number or depth, as soon
as additional abutment was required for wider arches.The windows, as in all Italian churches, are small, for the Italians
never patronised the art of painting on glass, always preferring
frescoes or paintings on opaque grounds.In their bright climate, very
small openings alone were requisite to admit a sufficiency of light
without disturbing that shadowy effect which is so favourable to
architectural grandeur.Being a parochial church, this building had no baptistery attached to
it; but there is one at Asti (Woodcut No.441) so similar in style and
age, that its plan and section, if examined with those of San Antonio,
will give a very complete idea of Lombard architecture in the beginning
of the 11th century, when it had completely shaken off the Roman
influence, but had not yet begun to combine the newly-invented forms
with that grace and beauty which mark its more finished examples.One
peculiarity of this building is the gloom that reigns within, there
being absolutely no windows in the dome, and those in the aisles are so
small, that even in Italy the interior must always have been in
comparative darkness.The cathedral of Novara, which in its present state is one of the most
important buildings of the 11th century in the North of Italy, shows the
style still further advanced.The coupling and grouping of piers are
here fully understood, and the divisions of the chapels which form the
outer aisle are, in fact, concealed buttresses.The Italians were never
able to divest themselves of their partiality for flat walls, and never
liked the bold external projections so universally admired on the other
side of the Alps.They therefore gladly had recourse to this expedient
to conceal them; and when this was not available they used metallic ties
to resist the thrust of the arches—an expedient which is found even in
this example.As will be seen from the annexed plan, the atrium
connecting the basilica with the baptistery is retained, which seems to
have been an arrangement almost universal in those early times.The half
section, half elevation of the front (Woodcut No.443) shows very
distinctly how far the invention of the new style had then gone; for
except some Corinthian pillars, borrowed from an older edifice, no trace
of debased-Roman architecture is to be found in it.The design of the
façade explains what it was that suggested to the Pisan architects the
form to which they adapted their Romanesque details.In both styles the
arcade was the original model of the whole system of ornamentation.In
this case it is used first as a discharging arch, then as a mere
repetition of a useful member, and lastly without pillars, as a mere
ornamental string-course, which afterwards became the most favourite
ornament, not only in Italy, but throughout all Germany.Elevation and Section of the Façade of the Cathedral
at Novara.Interesting as such an example is to the architectural antiquary who is
tracing back and trying to understand the forms of a new style, it would
be difficult to conceive anything much uglier and less artistic than
such a façade as this of Novara or that of San Antonio, last quoted.Their sole merit is their history and their expression of rude energy,
so characteristic of the people who erected them.The church of San Michele at Pavia, which took its present form either
at the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, is one of the
most interesting of this age, and presents in itself all the
characteristics of a perfect round-arched Gothic church.Indeed there is
hardly any feature worth mentioning which was invented after this date
except the pointed arch—a very doubtful improvement—and window tracery,
which the Italians never cordially adopted or understood.444) shows the general arrangement of San Michele in its
present state.The researches of M. de Dartein,[295] however, have shown
that, when first built, the nave was covered over with two square
quadripartite vaults, as might in fact have been divined from the
difference in size[296] of the centre and two other piers.The existing
oblong vaulted compartments date from the 15th century, when secondary
shafts were carried up above the ground storey shafts of piers 1 and 3.The section, however, shows that well-marked vaulting shafts spring from
floor to roof, that the pier arches in the wall are probably distinct
and well understood, and that the angles of these piers are softened and
ornamented by shafts and other subordinate members.Altogether, it is
evident that that subdivision of labour (if the expression may be used)
which was so characteristic of the true Gothic style had here been
perfectly understood, every part having its own function and telling its
own story.To complete the style only required a little experience to
decide on the best and most agreeable proportions in size and solidity.In a century from the date of this church the required progress had been
made; a century later it had been carried too far, and the artistic
value of the style was lost in mere masonic excellence.San Michele and
the other churches of its age fail principally from over-heaviness of
parts and a certain clumsiness of construction, which, though not
without its value as an expression of power, wants the refinement
necessary for a true work of art.Externally, one of the most pleasing
features of this church is the apse with its circular gallery.In
Italian churches the gallery is usually a simple range of similar
arcades; here, however, it is broken into three great divisions by
coupled shafts springing from the ground, and these again subdivided by
single shafts running in like manner through the whole height of the
apse.The gallery thus not only becomes a part of the whole design,
instead of looking like a possible afterthought, but an agreeable
variety is also given, which adds not a little to the pleasing effect of
the building.View of the Apse of San Michele, Pavia.(From Du
Somerard, ‘Les Arts au Moyen-Age.’)]

There are at least two other churches in Pavia, which, though altered in
many parts, retain their apsidal arrangements tolerably perfect.One of
these, that of San Teodoro (1150), may be somewhat later than the San
Michele, and has its gallery divided into triplets of arcades by bold
flat buttresses springing from the ground.In the other, San Pietro in
Cielo d’Oro, dating from 1132, the arcade is omitted round the apse,
though introduced in the central dome.It has besides two subordinate
apses of graceful design, but inferior to the other examples.Though Milan must have been rich in churches of this age, the only one
now remaining tolerably entire is San Ambrogio, which is so interesting
as almost to make amends for its singularity.Historical evidence shows
that a church existed here from a very early age.It was rebuilt in the
9th century by Bishop Angelbert, aided by the munificence of Louis the
Pious, and an atrium was added by Bishop Anspertus; but except the apse
and “the canons’” tower, nothing remains of even that church, all the
rest having been rebuilt in the 11th or 12th century.During the late
restoration the bases of some of the columns of the 9th-century church
were discovered, and one of them is now visible in the pulpit enclosure.The disposition of the building will be understood from the annexed
plan, which shows both the atrium and the church.The former is
virtually the nave; in other words, had the church been erected on the
colder and stormier side of the Alps, a clerestory would have been added
to the atrium, and it would have been roofed over; and then the plan
would have been nearly identical with that of a Northern cathedral.The third (sexpartite) bay was revaulted in the 14th century with two
oblong quadripartite vaults, but these are now replaced by sexpartite
vaulting.The dome is probably an addition of the end of the 12th
century, and it is raised over what would otherwise have been the fourth
bay of the church.As it is, the atrium (Woodcut No.446) is a highly
pleasing adjunct to the façade, removing the church back from the noisy
world outside, and by its quiet seclusion tending to produce that
devotional feeling so suitable to the entrance of a place of worship.The façade of the building itself, though, like the atrium, only in
brick, is one of the best designs of its age; the upper loggia, or open
gallery, of five bold but unequal arches, producing more shadow than the
façade at Pisa, without the multitude of small parts there crowded
together, and with far more architectural propriety and grace.As seen
from the atrium, with its two towers, one on either flank, it forms a
composition scarcely surpassed by any other in this style.As now restored, the simplicity and line effect of the vaulted interior
is remarkable, and it is also a museum of ecclesiological antiquities of
the best class.The silver altar of Angilbertus (A.D.835) is unrivalled
either for richness or beauty of design by anything of the kind known to
exist elsewhere, and the _baldacchino_ that surmounts it is also of
singular beauty: so are some of its old tombs, of the earliest Christian
workmanship.Its mosaics, its pulpit, and the bronze doors, not to
mention the brazen serpent—said to be the very one erected by Moses in
the wilderness—and innumerable other relics, make this church one of the
most interesting of Italy, if not indeed of all Europe.Atrium of San Ambrogio, Milan.[297])]

Generally speaking, the most beautiful part of a Lombard church is its
eastern end.The apse with its gallery, the transepts, and above all the
dome that almost invariably surmounts their intersection with the choir,
constitute a group which always has a pleasing effect, and is very often
highly artistic and beautiful.The sides of the nave, too, are often
well designed and appropriate; but, with scarcely a single exception,
the west end, or entrance front, is comparatively mean.The building
seems to be cut off at a certain length without any appropriate finish,
or anything to balance the bold projections towards the east.The French
cathedrals, on the contrary, while they entirely escape this defect by
means of their bold western towers, are generally deficient in the
eastern parts, and almost always lack the central dome or tower.The
English Gothic architects alone understood the proper combination of the
three parts.The Italians, when they introduced a tower, almost always
used it as a detached object, and not as a part of the design of the
church.In consequence of this the façades of their churches are
frequently the least happy parts of the composition, notwithstanding the
pains and amount of ornament lavished upon them.Façade of the Cathedral at Piacenza.(From Chapuy,
‘Moyen-Âge Monumental.’)]

The elevation of the cathedral at Piacenza is a fair illustration of the
general mode of treating the western front of the building, not only in
the 11th and 12th centuries, but afterwards, when a church had a façade
at all—for the Italians seem to have been seldom able to satisfy
themselves with this part of their designs, and a great many of their
most important churches have, in consequence, not even now been
completed in this respect.Instead of recessing their doors, as was the practice on this side of
the Alps, the Italians added projecting porches, often of considerable
depth, and supported by two or more slight columns, generally resting on
the backs of symbolical animals.No part of these porches, as an
architectural arrangement, can be deemed worthy of any commendation;
for, in the first place, a column planted on an animal’s back is an
anomaly and an absurdity, and the extreme tenuity of the pillars, as
compared with the mass they support, is so glaring that even its
universality fails in reconciling the eye to the disproportion.In the
present instance the porch is two storeys in height, the upper being a
niche for sculpture.Its almost exact resemblance to the entrance porch
below is therefore a defect.Above there is generally a gallery,
sometimes only in the centre; sometimes, as in this instance, at the
sides, though often carried quite across; and in the centre above this
there is almost invariably a circular window, the tracery of which is
frequently not only elaborately but beautifully ornamented with foliage
and various sculptural devices.Above this there is generally one of those open galleries mentioned
before, following the <DW72> of the roof, though frequently, as in this
instance, this is replaced by a mere belt of semicircular arches,
suggesting an arcade, but in reality only an ornament.Almost every important city in Lombardy shows local peculiarities in its
style, arising from some distinction of race or tradition.The greater
number of these must necessarily be passed over in a work like the
present, but some are so marked as to demand particular mention.Among
these that of Verona seems the most marked and interesting.This Roman
city became the favourite capital of Theodoric the Goth—Dietrich of
Berne, as the old Germans called him—and was by him adorned with many
noble buildings which have either perished or been overlooked.There is
a passage in the writings of his friend Cassiodorus which has hitherto
been a stumbling-block to commentators, but seems to find an explanation
in the buildings here, and to point to the origin of a mode of
decoration worth remarking upon.In talking of the architecture of his
day he speaks of “the reed-like tenuity of the columns making it appear
as if lofty masses of building were supported on upright spears, which
in regard to substance look like hollow tubes.”[298] It might be
supposed that this referred exclusively to the metal architecture of the
use of which we find traces in the paintings at Pompeii and
elsewhere.[299] But the context hardly bears this out, and he is
probably alluding to a stone or marble architecture, which in the
decline of true art had aspired to a certain extent to imitate the
lightness which the metallic form had rendered a favourite.To return to Verona:—The apse of the cathedral seems to have belonged to
an older edifice than that to which it is now attached, as was often the
case, that being the most solid as well as the most sacred part of the
building.449) it is ornamented with
pilasters, classical in design, but more attenuated than any found
elsewhere; so that I cannot but believe that this is either one of the
identical buildings to which Cassiodorus refers, or at least an early
copy from one of them.(From Hope’s ‘History
of Architecture.’)]

At a far later age, in the 12th century, the beautiful church of San
Zenone shows traces of the same style of decoration (Woodcut No.450),
pilasters being used here almost as slight as those at the cathedral,
but so elegant and so gracefully applied as to form one of the most
beautiful decorations of the style.Once introduced, it was of course
repeated in other buildings, though seldom carried to so great an extent
or employed so gracefully as in this instance.Indeed, whether taken
internally or externally, San Zenone may be regarded as one of the most
pleasing and perfect examples of the style to be found in the North of
Italy.The cathedral at Modena is another good example, though not possessing
any features of much novelty or deserving special mention.That of Parma
is also important, though hardly so pleasing.Indeed, scarcely any city
in the Valley of the Po is without some more or less-perfect churches of
this date, none showing any important peculiarities that have not been
exemplified above, unless perhaps it is the apse of the church of San
Donato on the Murano near Venice, which is decorated with a richness of
marble decoration to which the purer Gothic style never attained, and
which entitles this church to rank rather with the Byzantine than with
the Lombard buildings of which we are treating, or a style so curiously
exceptional as to make it one of the most interesting churches,
historically, to be found in the North of Italy.Façade of San Zenone, Verona.Recent discoveries in Syria[300] have proved almost beyond a doubt that
the carved slabs with which it is adorned externally were borrowed from
some desecrated building on the coast of Syria—destroyed probably by the
Moslems—and brought to Venice, probably at the time when the church
acquired the remains of San Donato, in the beginning of the 12th
century.Whether brought then or at an earlier period, they belong to
the age of Justinian, certainly came from the East, and, mixed up with
Italian details of the period, make up an exterior as picturesque as it
is interesting to the student of the history of art in those days.It is extremely difficult to draw a line between the pointed and
round-arched Gothic styles in Italy.The former was so evidently a
foreign importation, so unwillingly received and so little understood,
that it made its way but slowly.Even, for instance, in the church at
Vercelli, which is usually quoted as the earliest example of the pointed
style in Italy (built 1219-1222), there is not a pointed arch nor a
trace of one on the exterior.All the windows and openings are
round-headed, and, except the pier-arches and vaults, nothing pointed
appears anywhere.Even at a later date than this the round arch,
especially as a decorative form, is frequently placed above the pointed
one, and always used in preference to it.Instead, therefore, of
attempting to draw a line where none exists in reality, it will be
better now to pass on from this part of the subject, and to take up the
older style at a point from which we can best trace the formation of the
new.The latter does not essentially differ from the former, except in
the introduction of the French form of the pointed arch and its
accompaniments.It remains only to say a few words on the peculiarities
which the round form of churches took in the hands of the early Lombard
architects, as well as on the campanile, which forms so striking a
feature in the cities of Northern Italy.On the boundary-line which separates the Guelfic from the Ghibelline
influence, there exist at Toscanella, near Viterbo, two churches of
great beauty of detail; but which, as might almost be predicated from
their situation, defy any attempt at classification.They are not
Gothic, for they have no vaults, nor does their style suggest any
vaulting contrivances.They are scarcely debased Roman, for the tracery
of their circular windows, their many-shafted doors, and generally their
details are such as to indicate a Northern rather than a Roman affinity;
and the Byzantine sculpture which is found in the pulpit was probably
taken from an earlier church—though an Italian Byzantine influence can
be traced in much of its decoration.Under these circumstances, it is
better to treat them as exceptional, than to attempt to give them a name
which might mislead without conveying any correct information.Maria, was erected in the
beginning of the 13th century (1206?), but is so unlike most buildings
of that age, that it is usually ascribed to the 6th or 7th.On a close
examination, however, all its details are found to be full of advanced
Romanesque forms.The pillars are rude Corinthian, with a Lombardic
abacus.They are widely spaced, having no vault to support; and the
mouldings of the arches are what we should call “Transitional Early
English.”

[Illustration: 451.Externally the façade is too plain to be quite pleasing, but this arises
from its depending originally on painting for its decoration—some traces
of which still remain, but the greater part has perished.Its three
doorways are richly and beautifully ornamented with shafts and
sculptured foliage, quite equal in detail to anything of the class to be
found in Italy, and its great circular window would not be thought out
of place at Chartres or Lincoln.Pietro is probably a century later than that of Sta.Maria, and its façade is richer and more elegant—a difference arising
more from those details being in this instance carved which in the
earlier church were painted.The design, however, deserves attention for
its historical, perhaps, even more than its artistic claims; for it was
this class of façade that Palladio and the architects of the
cinque-cento period seized upon, and, applying pilasters and pediments
of classical type, converted it into the fashionable churches which are
to be found in every part of Europe.[301]

[Illustration: 453.Elevation of the Exterior of Sta.The difficulty which the Italians never entirely conquered, was how to
amalgamate the sloping lines of the roofs of the aisles with the
horizontal lines of the rest of the façade.The gallery over the central
doorway enabled them very nearly to accomplish it in these Toscanella
churches, and if the same string-courses had been carried all across,
the whole might have been harmonised; but it was just missed, and, what
is strange, more so in the second than in the first example.In the earliest times of Christian architecture, as we have already
seen, the circular form of church was nearly as frequent as that derived
from the Roman basilica.In process of time the latter was found to be
much better adapted to the extended requirements of Christianity.Hence
in the 11th and 12th centuries, when so many of the early churches were
rebuilt and enlarged, most of the old circular buildings disappeared.Enough, however, remain to enable us to trace, though imperfectly, what
their arrangements were.Among those which have been illustrated, perhaps the most interesting is
that known as the church of San Stefano at Bologna, or rather the
circular centre of that congeries of seven churches usually known by
that name.It is one of those numerous churches of which it is impossible to
predicate whether it was originally a baptismal or a sepulchral edifice.In old times it bore both names, and may have had both destinations, but
latterly, at all events, the question has been settled by the compromise
usually adopted in such cases, of dedicating it to the first martyr, to
whom a sepulchral form of building is especially appropriate.Plan of the Duomo, Brescia.Elevation of Duomo at Brescia.Notwithstanding a considerable amount of ancient remains mixed up in the
details, no part of the present church seems older than the Carlovingian
era; while, on the other hand, its extreme irregularity and clumsiness
of construction point to a period before the 11th century.Its general
form is that of an extremely irregular octagon, about 60 ft.in
diameter, in the centre of which stands a circlet of columns, some
coupled, some single, supporting a semicircular dome.The circumscribing
aisle is covered with the usual intersecting ribbed vault of the 10th
century, but the whole is so rude as scarcely to deserve mention except
for its antiquity.The Duomo Vecchio of Brescia is ascribed to the 8th or 9th century, but
this date according to Cattaneo[302] can only be ascribed to an earlier
basilica church, the crypt of which still exists on the east side of the
Duomo.As will be seen from the plan, it is a large church, 125 ft.across over all, and is covered by a dome 65 ft.in diameter internally
supported by eight piers of plain design.The mode in which light is
introduced into the central compartment illustrates the various
tentative expedients by which the architects in that age attempted to
accomplish their object.First, there is a range of small windows in the
dome below the springing of the dome.In the dome itself there are four
circular sides, and, as if the architect felt that he was doing
something unusual and inartistic, he managed externally to confuse these
with the rudiments of the roof gallery.(From Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)
Scale 50 ft.It is not clear whether originally it had or was intended to have an
apse between its two round towers—where the foundations of some
buildings can still be traced; but these may be the remains of the early
church referred to.Turning from these, we find the round-arched Gothic style completely
developed in the church of San Tomaso in Limine, near Bergamo.From the
annexed plan it will be seen that the circular part is the nave or
entrance, as in Germany and England, in contradistinction to the French
mode of arrangement, where the circular part is always the sanctum, the
rectangular the nave or less holy place.In the centre stand eight pillars, supporting a
vaulted gallery, which forms a triforium or upper storey, and, with the
dome and its little cupola, raise the whole height to about 50 ft.A
small choir with a semicircular niche projects eastward.The dimensions of the building are so small that it hardly deserves
notice, except as a perfect example of the style of the 11th or 12th
century in Lombardy, and for a certain propriety and elegance of design,
in which it is not surpassed, internally at least, by any building of
its age.It is to be regretted that the idea was never carried out (at
any rate no example remains) on such a scale as to enable us to judge of
the effect of such a domical arrangement as is here attempted.The great
defect of all one-storeyed domes is their lowness, both internally and
more especially externally.This method of building a dome in two
storeys would seem calculated to obviate the objection; but though
common in small sepulchral chambers, it has never been tried on a scale
sufficiently large to enable us to judge of its real effect.After this
period the circular shape was so completely superseded by the
rectangular, that no further improvement took place in it.There is perhaps no question of early Christian archæology involved in
so much obscurity as that of the introduction and early use of towers.The great monumental pillars of the Romans—as, for instance, those of
Trajan and Antoninus—were practically towers; and latterly their tombs
began to assume an aspiring character like that at St.231), or those at Palmyra and elsewhere in the East, which show a marked
tendency in that direction.But none of these can be looked upon as an
undoubted prototype of the towers attached to the churches of the
Christians.At Ravenna, as early as the age of Justinian, we find a circular tower
attached to St.Apollinare in Classe (Woodcut No.412), and in the other
churches of that place they seem even then to have been considered
necessary adjuncts.[303] At the same time it is by no means clear that
they were erected as bell-towers; indeed the evidence is tolerably clear
that bells were not used in Christian churches till the time of Pope
Adrian I., some two centuries later.There is, I
think, no trace of their being sepulchral monuments, or that they were
designed or used as tombs; and unless they were, like the _sthambas_ of
the Buddhists, pillars of victory, or towers erected to mark sacred or
remarkable spots, it is difficult to say what they were, or where we are
to look for an analogy.Be this as it may, the oldest circular towers with which we are
acquainted are those of Ravenna; while the last of the series is the
famous leaning one at Pisa, commenced in the year 1174.The gradations
between these two extremes must have been the same that marked the
changes in the architecture of the churches to which they are attached;
but the links are more completely wanting in the case of the towers than
in that of the churches.[304]

[Illustration: 459.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)]Apollinare in Classe, above referred to, the most
perfect of those of Ravenna, is a simple brick tower (see Woodcut No.412), nine storeys in height, the lower windows being narrow single
openings; above there are two, and the three upper storeys are adorned
with four windows of three lights each.In Rome, as far as we know, the first tower attached to a church was
that said to have been built by Pope Adrian I. in front of the atrium of
St.Peter’s; but there are no examples now existing in Rome which can be
said to be earlier than the 11th century, and that date applies only to
the lower portion of them.In the 12th and 13th centuries they became
common, and we find them attached to the churches of S. Lorenzo without
the walls, S. Croce in Gerusalemme, SS.Giovanni e Paolo, S. Giorgio in
Velabro (13th century), and others.All these are square in plan and
extremely similar in design, no improvement and scarcely any change
having taken place between the first and the last, as if the form were
an old and established one when we find it first adopted.Maria in Cosmedin (Woodcut No.459) is perhaps one of the best
and most complete.Its dimensions are small, its breadth being little
more than 15 ft., and its height only 110; but notwithstanding this
there is great dignity in the design, and, in a city where buildings are
not generally tall, its height is sufficient to give it prominence
without overpowering other objects,—a characteristic which renders these
Roman towers not only beautiful structures in themselves, but
appropriate ornaments to the buildings to which they are attached.The chief interest of these towers is derived from the numerous progeny
to which they gave birth: for though there is scarcely an instance of a
square Romanesque tower beyond the walls of Rome during the period in
which this style flourished, the form was seized upon with avidity by
the Gothic architects in all the countries of Europe; and whether as a
detached campanile (as in Italy), or as an integral part of the building
(as we soon find it employed on this side of the Alps), it forms the
most prominent, and perhaps also the most beautiful, feature in the
aspiring architecture of the Middle Ages.There is certainly no architectural feature which the Gothic architects
can so justly call their own as the towers and spires which in the
Middle Ages were so favourite, so indispensable a part of their churches
and other edifices, becoming in fact as necessary parts of the external
design as the vaults were of the internal decoration of the building.It is true, as before remarked, that we neither know where they were
first invented, nor even where they were first applied to Christian
churches—those of Rome and Ravenna being evidently not the earliest
examples; nor have they any features which betray their origin—at least
none have yet been pointed out, though it is not impossible that a
closer examination would bring some such to light.They certainly are as
little classical, in form or details, as anything that can well be
conceived; and belong to an undefined Romanesque style.Those of which we have already spoken are all church-towers—_campaniles_
or bell-towers attached to churches.But this exclusive distinction by
no means applies to the Gothic towers.Mark at Venice,
for instance, and the Toraccio at Cremona, are evidently civic
monuments, like the belfries of the Low Countries—symbols of communal
power wholly distinct from the church, their proximity to which seems
only to arise from the fact of all the principal buildings being grouped
together.This is certainly the case with a large class of very ugly
buildings in Italy, such as those attached to the town-halls of Florence
and Siena, or the famous Asinelli and Garisenda towers at Bologna.They
are merely tall square brick towers, with a machicolated balcony at the
top, but possessing no more architectural design than the chimney of a
cotton factory.Originally, when lower, they may have been towers of
defence, but afterwards became mere symbols of power.A third class, and by far the most numerous, of these buildings are
undoubtedly ecclesiastical erections; they are either actually attached
to the churches, or so placed with regard to them as to leave no doubt
on the matter.There is not, however, I believe, in all Italy a single
example of a tower or towers forming, as on this side of the Alps, an
integral part of the design.Sometimes they stand detached, but more generally are connected with
some angle of the building, the favourite position being the western
angle of the southern transept.Occasionally we find one tower placed at
the angle of the façade, but this is seldom the case when the tower and
the church are of the same age.It is so in the cathedral at Lucca, and
San Ambrogio at Milan; in the latter of which a second tower has been
added more recently to balance the older one.It does also happen as in
the instance of Novara, before quoted (Woodcut No.443), that two towers
are actually parts of the original design; this, however, is certainly
the exception, not the rule.In design the Italian campaniles differ very considerably from those on
this side of the Alps.They never have projecting buttresses, nor assume
that pyramidal form which is so essential and so beautiful a feature in
the Northern examples.In plan the campanile is always square, and
carried up without break or offset to two-thirds at least of its
intended height.This, which is virtually the whole design (for the
spire seems an idea borrowed from the North), is generally solid to a
considerable height, or with only such openings as serve to admit light
to the stairs or inclined planes.Above the solid part one round-headed
window is introduced in each face, and in the next storey two; in the
one above this three, then four, and lastly five, the lights being
merely separated by slight shafts, so that the upper storey is virtually
an open loggia (see Woodcut No.There is no doubt great beauty and
propriety of design in this arrangement; in point of taste it is
unobjectionable, but it wants the vigour and variety of the Northern
tower.So far as we can judge from drawings and such ancient examples as
remain, the original termination was a simple cone in the centre, with a
smaller one at each of the angles.At Verona an octagonal lantern is added, and at Modena and Cremona the
octagon is crowned by a lofty spire, but these hardly come within the
limits of the epoch of which we are now treating.So greatly did the
Italians prefer the round arch, that even in their imitation of the
Northern styles they used the pointed shape only when compelled—a
circumstance which makes it extremely difficult, particularly in the
towers, to draw the line between the two styles; for though pointed
arches were no doubt introduced in the 13th and 14th centuries, the
circular-headed shape continued to be employed from the age of the
Romanesque to that of the Renaissance.One of the oldest and certainly the most celebrated of the Gothic towers
of Italy, is that of St.Mark’s at Venice, commenced in the year 902; it
took the infant republic three centuries to raise it 180 ft., to the
point at which the square basement terminates.On this there must
originally have been an open loggia of some sort, no doubt with a
conical roof.The present superstructure was added in the 16th century;
but though the loggia is a very pleasing feature, it is overpowered by
the solid mass that it surmounts, and by the extremely ugly square
extinguisher that crowns the whole.Its locality and its associations
have earned for it a great deal of undue laudation, but in point of
design no campanile in Italy deserves it less.The base is a mere
unornamented mass of brickwork, slightly fluted, and pierced
unsymmetrically with small windows to light the inclined plane within.Its size, its height, and its apparent solidity are its only merits.These are no doubt important elements in that low class of architectural
excellence of which the Egyptian pyramids are the type; but even in
these elements this edifice must confess itself a pigmy, and inferior to
even a second-class pyramid on the banks of the Nile, while it has none
of the beauty of design and detail displayed by the Giralda of Seville,
or even by other Italian towers in its own neighbourhood.The campanile at Piacenza (Woodcut No.448) is, perhaps, more like the
original of St.Mark’s than any other, and certainly displays as little
beauty as any building of this sort can possess.That of San Zenone at Verona is far more pleasing.It is, indeed, as
beautiful both in proportion and details as any of its age, while it
exemplifies at once the beauties and the defects of the style.Among the
first is an elegant simplicity that always is pleasing, but this is
accompanied by a leanness and poverty of effect, when compared with
Northern examples, which must rank in the latter category.Jackson, in his work on Dalmatia and Istria, gives illustrations of
several towers in those countries which, in beauty of design, excel many
of the Italian examples.The Romanesque style would seem to have had a
much longer duration on the east side of the Adriatic than in Italy.Thus the tower of Spalato, a lofty campanile of six storeys in height,
commenced in the beginning of the 13th century and not terminated till
1416 (except the upper octagon and spire), is virtually in the same pure
Romanesque style throughout.Jackson notes also the continued
influence of Roman work of the 3rd century, by which it is surrounded,
and that fragments of ancient material, columns and capitals, have been
used up in its construction.The campaniles of Zara and in the island of
Arbe are both fine examples of Romanesque design.CHAPTER V.

It would be easier to define the limits and character of the styles of
Italian Mediæval Architecture in the centre and south of Italy by a
negative than a positive title.To call them the “non-Gothic” styles
would describe them correctly, but would hardly suffice to convey a
distinct idea of their peculiarities.Romanesque, or even Italian
Romanesque, would not be sufficient, because that term fails to take
cognizance of the foreign element found in them.That element is the
Byzantine, derived partly from the continued relations which such cities
as Venice or Pisa maintained during the Middle Ages with the Levant, and
partly from the intercourse which the inhabitants of Magna Gracia kept
up across the Adriatic with the people on its eastern shores.To such a
mixture of styles the term Byzantine-Romanesque would be quite
appropriate; and although there are in Apulia churches, such as Molfetta
and St.Angelo, which look more like Levantine designs than anything to
be found in other parts of Europe (except perhaps such buildings as St.Front, Périgueux, and one or two exceptional buildings in the South of
France), and in a very detailed description of Italian styles it might
be expedient to attempt a further subdivision with other specific terms,
for the present it will probably suffice to describe the various
non-Gothic styles of the centre and southern half of Italy in local
sections without attempting any very minute classification of their
variations.As the Italians had no great national style of their own,
and both in the North and South were principally working under foreign
influences, it is in vain to look for any thread that will conduct the
student straight through the labyrinth of their styles.Italian unity is
the aspiration of the present century; during the Middle Ages it did not
exist either in politics or art.The Old and New Cathedrals at Naples.Although Naples is in the very centre of its province, where we
naturally first look for examples of the style, there are few cities in
Italy which contain so little to interest the architect or the
antiquary.Still she does possess one group of churches, which, by their
juxtaposition, at least serve to illustrate the progress of the style
during the Middle Ages.Restituta—shaded
dark in the plan (Woodcut No.460)—may be as old as the 4th or 5th
century, and retains its original plan and arrangement, though much
disfigured in details.The baptistery, a little behind the apse on its
left, is certainly of the date indicated, and retains its mosaics, which
seem to be of the same age.of Anjou commenced the new cathedral at
right angles with the old, his French prejudices being apparently
shocked at the incorrect orientation of the older church.It is a
spacious building, 300 ft.long, arranged, as Italian churches usually
were at that age, with a wooden roof over the nave and intersecting
vaults over the side-aisles.Opposite the entrance of the old cathedral
is a domical chapel of Renaissance design, so that the group contains an
illustration of each of the three ages of Italian art.Section of San Miniato, near Florence.The church of San Miniato (Woodcuts Nos.461-463), on a hill overlooking
Florence, is one of the earliest (1013), as well as one of the most
perfect, of the Byzantine-Romanesque style.in length by 70 in width, divided longitudinally into aisles, and
transversely into three nearly square compartments by clustered piers
supporting two great arches which run up to the roof.The whole of the
eastern compartment is occupied by a crypt or under-church open to the
nave, above which are the choir and apse, approached by flights of steps
in the aisles.The entire arrangement, together with the division of the
nave into three compartments, is most satisfactory, and the proportions
of the whole are very appropriate.The pillars themselves are so nearly
classical in design that they almost seem to have been taken from some
ancient building, and the architraves and stringcourses are all well
designed and fitted to the places they occupy.The principal ornament of
the interior is an inlaid pattern of simple design, sufficient to
relieve the monotony of the interior, but without producing any
confusion.The exterior depends principally, like the interior, for its
effect on  panelling, but has a range of blind arches running
round the sides and across the front.The façade, however, is very badly
designed: either it was one of the earliest examples, and the architects
had not learned how to combine the sloping roofs of the aisles with the
upper part of the façades, or it has been altered in more modern times;
but for this slight defect it would be difficult to find a church in
Italy containing more of classic elegance, with perfect appropriateness
for the purposes of Christian worship.There must have been several, probably many, buildings in the same style
erected in Tuscany during the first half of the 11th century.Otherwise
it is almost impossible to understand how so complete a design as that
of Pisa Cathedral could have been executed.It was commenced apparently
in 1006, but it was not till 1063, after the plundering of Palermo,
according to Reber,[305] that the means were provided for the
extraordinary richness of the design, the magnificence of which had at
that time no parallel among the ecclesiastical edifices of Italy; the
work was suspended in 1095, and could only be resumed by means of
pecuniary aid given to the undertaking by the Byzantine emperor.After
the consecration of the cathedral in 1103, the interior decorations were
carried on until the 15th century.Internally its design is evidently
based on that of the basilicas of Rome and Ravenna, except that instead
of the range at the latter place of figures in mosaic, it has a splendid
triforium gallery and in plan strongly marked projecting transepts.Its
great merit, however, as a design arises from the fact that the builders
had learned to proportion the parts to one another so as to get greater
magnificence with very much smaller dimensions.The size, for instance,
of the nave of San Paolo fuori le Mure at Rome is 290 ft.by 215; these
dimensions are nearly double those at Pisa, where they are 173 ft.Yet, in consequence of the greater relative height of the nave and
the better spacing of the pillars and proportion of the parts, the
interior of Pisa is more pleasing and more impressive than the Roman
church.Its effect, too, is immensely increased by the truly Mediæval
projection of the transepts.In no church in Italy is there such poetry
of perspective as in looking anglewise across the intersection, and
seldom anywhere a more satisfactory interior than that of this church.(From Chapuy’s
‘Moyen-Age Monumental.’)]

The exterior, too, is almost equally pleasing.The side-aisles are
adorned with a range of blind arches running all round, adorned with
parti- marble, inlaid either in courses or in patterns.Above
this is a gallery, representing the triforium, carried all round, and in
the façades formed into an open gallery; a second open gallery
represents the sloping roof of the aisles, a third the clerestory, a
fourth the <DW72>s of the great roof.The difficulty here, as in almost
all Italian designs, is caused by the sloping roofs; but, with this
exception, the whole makes up a rich and varied composition without any
glaring false construction, and expresses with sufficient clearness the
arrangements of the interior.The dome is of later design, and, being
oval in plan, cannot be said to be pleasing in outline.The Italians were evidently delighted with their new style.It was
repeated with very little variation at Lucca, in the church of San
Michele (1188), only that the arcades stood free on the sides as well as
on the front.The façade of San Martino, in the same city, is in the
same style; so is that of the cathedral at Pistoja, and so is Sta.The arrangement was probably suggested by the porticoes of
Pagan temples; and were it not for the awkwardness caused by the sloping
line of the roofs, it might be characterised as one of the most
successful inventions of the age.In some instances, as in the façade of the Cathedral at Zara in Dalmatia
(Woodcut No.Jackson[306] was not begun
before the 13th century, the consecration taking place in 1285, the
difficulties of the design of the façade are to a great extent conquered
by reducing the arcades to mere decorative panelling, and more than this
by separating the design of the centre from that of the aisles by a bold
square pilaster.This is exactly the feature we miss at Pisa and Lucca,
where the want of it imparts a considerable degree of weakness to the
whole design.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia and Montenegro.’)]

The plan of the Zara Cathedral (Woodcut No.466) is that usually adopted
in churches of this class; but it possesses a lady chapel and
baptistery, placed laterally in a somewhat unusual manner.Its
dimensions are small, being only 170 ft.The east end of this church, its doorways and windows, show, as might be
expected from its locality, a greater tendency towards Romanesque art
than can be found on the western shores of the Peninsula, but in
internal arrangements it belongs wholly to the Italian style.The cathedral at Trau, also in Dalmatia, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s
work, is a fine example, which is not only built in one consistent style
throughout, but possesses the still rarer advantage of being completed
outside as well as inside, “instead,” as Mr.Jackson observes, “of
presenting, like so many Italian churches, a rough face of unfinished
brickwork or masonry awaiting in vain the splendid veneer of marble or
sculpture that never comes.” The main part of the church was built in
the first half of the 13th century.The floor is of the basilica type,
with nave (five bays, vaulted) and aisles, centre and side apses, and a
magnificent narthex, the full width of nave and aisles, with a sumptuous
portal of pure Romanesque design (1240), which is perhaps finer than any
example in Italy, and is only rivalled in its decorative sculpture by
those of the French portals.Jackson is of opinion that Dalmatian
art took a great departure under Hungarian rule, and followed more in
the direction of the purer Romanesque style than in that of the
Byzantine.The artists were foreigners, invited not only from Germany
but also from France.Villars d’Honecourt recounts his having been sent
for, and “French influence,” Mr.Jackson states, “may be detected in
some other churches in Hungary.” The portal of the church at Jak, in
Hungary, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work, is French in character, with
a profusion of orders carved with the zigzag fret and dentil very
similar to the later Norman work, and includes capitals “à crochet” such
as belong to French 12th-century work.The series of trefoil-headed
niches, with figures in them which rise above the doorway, are French in
character, and remind one of the façade of St.Père-sous-Vezelay.At
Cattaro, in Dalmatia, and at Veglia, in one of the islands of the
Quarnero, are other examples of fine Romanesque work of the 12th
century.Further south on the mainland of Italy, at Troja, we find a singularly
elegant cathedral church (1093-1115?)Its flanks and apse are perhaps even more elegant than anything in
the neighbourhood of Pisa.So is the lower part of its façade, which is
adorned with a richness and elegance of foliage characteristic of the
province where it is found; and the cornice that crowns the lower storey
is perhaps unmatched by any similar example to be found in Italy, either
for beauty of sculptural decoration or for appropriateness of profile.The upper part of the façade differs, however, considerably from that of
the examples just quoted.A great rose-window, of elegant but
ill-understood tracery, takes the place of the arcades, and, with the
sculptured arch over it, completes all that remains of the original
design.The plain pieces of walling that support the central window are
parts of a modern repair.As a general rule, all the churches in the South of Italy are small.This one at Troja is arranged in plan like that at Pisa, with bold
projecting transepts, but its length is only 167 ft., and the width of
its nave 50, while in the Northern cathedral these dimensions are nearly
double—310 ft.by 106—and the area four times as great.This is true of
all, however elegant they may be—they are parish churches in dimensions
as compared with their Northern rivals.Many also, as the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.469), have their apses
internal, which detracts very much from the meaning of the design, and
does away with the apsidal terminations, which are perhaps the most
beautiful features in the external design of Italian churches; while
they lack the great traceried windows which go so far to replace the
absence of the apse in English design.The annexed elevation of the east
end at Bari (Woodcut No.470) gives a fair idea of the general
arrangement of that part in the churches in Apulia.It is novel, and the
two tall towers with a central dome combine with elegant details to make
up a whole which it is impossible not to admire though it will not bear
comparison with the more artistic arrangements of Northern architects.Where the apse[308] is allowed to be seen externally, it is sometimes,
as at San Pellino (Woodcut No.471), an object of great beauty and
originality, but such examples are rare in the province, and the designs
suffer in proportion.(From a Sketch by
A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]In the richer churches, as at Pisa, a blind arcade is carried round the
flanks, sometimes with an open gallery under the eaves, as in German
churches, but this was far from being universally the case; on the
contrary, it would be difficult, as a typical example of the style, to
select one more characteristic than the flank of the church of Caserta
Vecchia (1100-1153) (Woodcut No.The windows are small but
numerous, and mark the number of bays in the interior.The transept is
slightly projected, and ornamented with an arcade at the top, and above
this rises a dome such as is found only in Calabria or Sicily.The tower
was added afterwards, and, though unsymmetrical, assists in relieving a
design which would otherwise run the risk of being monotonous.West Front of the Church of San Nicolo in Bari.(From a Sketch by A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]It was, however, on their entrance façades that the architects of
Southern Italy lavished their utmost care.The central doorways are
usually covered with rich hoods, supported by pillars resting on
monsters somewhat like those found in the North of Italy.Above this is
either a gallery or one or two windows, and the whole generally
terminates in a circular rose-window filled with tracery.As exemplified
in the front of Bittonto Cathedral (Woodcut No.473), such a composition
is not deficient in richness, though hardly pleasing as an architectural
composition.The same arrangement, on about the same scale, occurs at Bari, Altamura,
and Ruvo; and on a somewhat smaller scale in the churches of Galatina,
Brindisi, and Barletta.The great and peculiar beauty of the cathedral
at Bittonto is its south front, one angle of which is shown in the
woodcut; but which becomes richer towards the east, where it is adorned
with a portal of great magnificence and beauty.The richness of its open
gallery (under what was the roof of the side-aisles) is unsurpassed in
Apulia, and probably by anything of the same kind in Italy.View of the Interior of San Nicolo, Bari.The façade of San Nicolo at Bari (1197) is something like the last
mentioned, except that handsome Corinthian columns have been borrowed
from some older building, and add to the richness of the design, though
they hardly can be said to belong to the composition.Internally this
church seems to have displayed some such arrangement as that of San
Miniato (Woodcuts No.Instead, however, of improving upon it,
as might be expected from the time that had elapsed since the previous
one was erected, the Southern architect hardly knew the meaning of what
he was attempting.He grouped together the three pillars next to the
entrance, and threw arches across the nave from them, but these arches
neither support the roof nor aid the construction in any other way.They
do add to the perspective effect of the interior, but it is only by a
theatrical contrivance very rare in the Middle Ages, and by no means to
be admired when found.Most of these Apulian churches possess crypts almost as important as
that of San Miniato, some more so; and the numerous pillars in some of
these give rise to effects of perspective only to be found elsewhere in
such buildings as the Mosque at Cordova, or the cisterns at
Constantinople.As in the annexed example, from the cathedral at
Otranto, it is wonderful what space and what variety may be attained
with small dimensions by the employment of numerous points of support.This was the secret of most of the best effects produced by the Northern
architects; but the Italians never understood it, or practised it,
except in crypts.Perhaps it may have been that they thought it
necessary to sacrifice architectural effect to the exigencies of public
worship.Whether this were the cause or not, the result, as already
pointed out, was fatal to the architectural effect of many of their
designs, especially in the Northern province.In Southern Italy this is seldom the case, but the difference arose from
the fact that the naves of the churches had never vaulted roofs, and
were consequently separated from the aisles by single pillars instead of
composite piers.This took away all temptation to display mechanical
dexterity, and left the architect free to produce the best artistic
effect he was able to design with the materials at his command.Window in the South Side of the Cathedral Church at
Matera.No one who takes the pains to familiarise himself with the architecture
of these Southern Italian churches, can well fail to be impressed with
their beauty.That beauty will be found, however, to arise not so much
from the dimensions or arrangement of their plans, or the form of their
outline, as from the grace and elegance of their details.Every feature
displays the feeling of an elegant and refined people, who demanded
decoration as a necessity, though they were incapable of rising to any
great architectural conception.They excelled as ornamentists, though at
best only indifferent architects.It is impossible to render this evident in such a work as the present;
but besides the examples already given, a window (Woodcut No.478) from
the cathedral church at Matera (1270) will explain how unlike the style
of decoration is to anything with which we are familiar in the North,
and at the same time how much picturesque effect may be produced by a
repetition of similar details.The church itself has this peculiarity,
that its west front is plain and unimportant, and that all the
decoration is lavished on the south side, which faces the piazza.There
are two entrances on this face, that towards the east being, as usual,
the richer.Above these is a range of richly-ornamented windows, one of
which—a little out of the centre—is far more splendid than the rest
(Woodcut No.From this it is said that letters and rescripts from
the Greek patriarch at Constantinople used to be read, and it is perhaps
as elaborate a specimen of the mode of decoration used in these churches
as can be found in the province.Doorway of Church of Pappacoda, Naples.The same exuberance of decoration continued to be employed down to the
latest period of the art, and after Northern forms had been introduced
by the Angiovine dynasty at Naples.The doorway from the church at
Pappacoda (Woodcut No.479) is a type of many to be found in that city
and elsewhere in the architectural province.True, it is overdone to
such an extent that much of the labour bestowed upon it must be
considered as thrown away; but if a love of art induced people to labour
so lovingly in it, it is hard to refuse them the admiration which their
enthusiasm deserves.Another class of ornamental detail in which this province is especially
rich is that of bronze doors, of which some six or seven examples still
remain.Of these perhaps the finest are those of the cathedral at Trani.They were made in 1160, and for beauty of design, and for the exuberance
and elegance of their ornaments, are unsurpassed by anything of the kind
in Italy, or probably in the world.Another pair of doors of almost
equal beauty, made in 1119, belongs to the cathedral at Troja (Woodcut
No.468), and a third, which is still in a very perfect state,
constructed at Constantinople, in the year 1076, for the church of Mont
San Angelo; and is consequently contemporary with the doors of Sta.Sophia, Novogorod, and San Zenone, Verona, and so similar in design as
to form an interesting series for comparison.Other churches in the same style as those mentioned above are found at
Canosa, Giovenazzo, Molo, Ostuni, Manduria, and other places in the
province.Those of Brindisi, from which we should expect most, have been
too much modernised to be of value as examples; but there is in the town
a small circular church of great beauty, built apparently by the Knights
Templars, and afterwards possessed by the Knights of St.It is now
in ruins, but many of the frescoes which once adorned its walls still
remain, as well as the marble pillars that supported its roof.Being at
some distance from the harbour, the Knights of St.John built another
small church near the port, which still remains nearly unaltered.Although throughout the Middle Ages Rome went on building large
churches, it was in the debased-Roman style already referred to, fitting
together Roman pillars with classical details of more or less purity,
but hardly, except in their cloisters, deserving the name of a style.Perhaps the most original, as it certainly is one of the most beautiful,
things the Romans did, is the cloister of St.There the
little arcades, supported by twisted columns, and adorned with mosaics,
are as graceful and pleasing as anything of that class found elsewhere;
and as they are encased in a framework of sufficient strength to take
off all appearance of mechanical weakness, their unconstructive forms
are not unpleasing.The entablature, which is the ruling feature in the
design, retains the classical arrangement in almost every detail, and in
such purity as could only be found in Rome in the 13th century, when
this cloister appears to have been erected; but the style never extended
beyond the limits of that city, and thus has little bearing on the
thread of our narrative.The cloister of the Benedictine monastery adjoining the basilica of St.Paul’s outside the walls, is another example of the same kind in which
the columns present almost every variety of form; spiral, twisted,
fluted, and sometimes two or three of these combined, many of them, as
well as the entablature, being covered with mosaics.As already remarked, the architects of the southern half of the Italian
peninsula were generally content to adopt the Romanesque plan of
covering their naves with a wooden roof—for when an intersecting vault
is found it is clearly a French or German interpolation—but they often
employed one dome, generally over the altar, and used it as an ornament
both external and internal.The two illustrations already given of the
domes at Bari (Woodcut No.470) and Caserta Vecchia (Woodcut No.472)
show the form these usually took in the province.They belong to a type
not unusual in the East, but unknown to the Gothic architects of Europe.When called upon to roof their churches with stone, they almost
invariably adopted the domical in preference to the vaulted form, as at
Molfetta (1162), where they make a pleasing form of roof, not unlike
that of Loches Cathedral (Woodcut No.The great defect of domes
when thus employed is their height, which generally throws the whole of
the building out of proportion; and unless light is introduced through
openings in the drum, or in the dome itself, they are dark and gloomy.This is certainly the case at Molfetta, but otherwise the church seems
well designed and of pleasing proportions.To be successful, domes
should be low and flat internally; and any height required externally
must be given by a false dome, as at St.Mark’s, or as done by the
Renaissance architects generally.This was not so much felt when the building was square, and covered by
only one dome, like the baptistery or tomb of Mont St.Angelo, where
effect of space on the floor was not aimed at so much as a combination
of external dignity with limited dimensions in plan, and was attained by
the arrangement adopted.As will be observed, the pointed arch, as in
the tower at Gaeta (Woodcut No.489), is used in the basement, but above
this round arches with balusters for pillars, such as we should call
Saxon, though their age here may be the 12th century.Among the little bits of Orientalism that crop up here and there all
over the province, one of the most pleasing is the little tomb of
Bohemund at Canosa (1111).It is charming to find in Italy an Eastern
Kibleh with its dome, erected to contain the remains of a Christian
king.Though elegant, however, the dome is not fitted to the square, as
it would have been in more experienced hands, and the whole design is
somewhat badly put together.Its bronze doors are among its chiefest
ornaments, and are elegant, though inferior to numerous examples of the
same class in the churches of the province.Many other examples of Byzantine domical forms might be quoted as
existing in Southern Italy.It is not, however, so much in the forms as
in the details that the Eastern influence is felt, and that no less in
the churches which retain the basilican form of Ravenna than in those
which assume the domical form of Constantinople.The buildings of the Southern Province cannot certainly compete with
those of the Northern either in size or in daring mechanical
construction, but in detail they are frequently more beautiful, while
their forms are more national and less constrained.Their great
interest, however, in the eyes of the student, consists in their forming
a link between the Eastern and Western worlds, and thus joining together
two styles which we have hitherto been too much in the habit of
considering as possessing no point of contact.One of the best known, as well as one of the largest examples of this
class of buildings in Italy, is the baptistery at Pisa (seen partially
on the left side of Woodcut No.Internally it is, as nearly as may
be, 100 ft.in diameter, and the walls are about 8 ft.The dome itself, however, is only 60 ft.in diameter, and is
supported on four piers and eight pillars.These serve to separate the
central space from the aisle which runs round it, and which is two
storeys in height, but singularly ill-proportioned and clumsy in detail.The worst part of the design, however, is the dome, if dome it can be
called.Internally it is conical in form, and thrust through an external
hemispherical dome in a manner more clumsy and unpleasing than any other
example of its class.Externally, these defects are to some extent
atoned for by considerable richness and beauty of detail.It had
originally only one range of blind arcades, with three-quarter columns,
surmounted by an open arcade; an arrangement exactly similar to that of
the two lower storeys of the cathedral and the leaning tower (Woodcut
No.A considerable amount of pointed Gothic decoration was
afterwards added, which, though somewhat incongruous, is elegant in
itself, and hides to some extent the original defects of the design.But
the outline of the building and its whole arrangements are so radically
bad, that no amount of ornament can ever redeem them.Taken altogether, the Pisan baptistery is so very peculiar, that it
would be interesting if its design could be traced back to some
undoubted original.That this is possible will hardly be doubted by any
one at all familiar with the subject; meanwhile, the building most like
it that has been illustrated is the little church of San Donato, at
Zara.at the beginning of the 9th century, with materials taken
from ancient buildings, some of them of the best period of Roman
architecture.The two monolithic columns in front of the triple
sanctuary, and which are 30 ft.in height, bear testimony to the size
and importance of the temple they originally adorned, and the great
thickness of the walls and the size of the piers suggest a wealth of
material at the disposal of the builders.The rectangular building on
the south side Mr.Jackson considers to be coeval with the church; and
the chamber over it, which was on the same level and originally opened
on to the gallery round the aisles, formed a second church intended for
the use of the catechumens.The church is so built round that it is
impossible to say what its external appearance may have been.Both from
its resemblance to the Pisan baptistery and its own merits, it is an
interesting addition to our knowledge of those circular churches which
were such favourites with all the Christian architects in the
Carlovingian period.The resemblance in this instance is the more
remarkable, because the façade of the cathedral at Zara (Woodcut No.467) is in the Pisan style, only slightly modified by local
peculiarities.From what we already know, it seems undoubted that there
was a close connection—architecturally, at least—between Pisa and Zara.If this were fully investigated, it would probably throw considerable
light on the origin of the Pisan style, which has hitherto seemed so
exceptional in Italy, and also explain how the Byzantine element came to
be so strongly developed in what at first sight appears to be a
Romanesque style of art.Ground and Upper Storey of San Donato, Zara.The typical example of a tower in the Italian style is the celebrated
leaning tower at Pisa, partly seen in Woodcut No.It is, indeed, so
far as we at present know, the only one which carries out that
arrangement of numerous tiers of superimposed arcades which is so
characteristic of the style.The lower storey is well designed as a
solid basement for the superincumbent mass; its walls are 13 ft.in
thickness, and it is adorned with 15 three-quarter columns: its height
being 35 ft.The six storeys above this average 20 ft.in height, and
are each adorned with an open arcade.The whole is crowned by a smaller
circular tower, 27 ft.in height, in which the bells are hung.The
entire height is thus 182 ft.; the mean diameter of the main portion,
52.There is no doubt that it was originally intended to stand
perpendicular, though the contrary has been asserted; but before the
commencement of the fifth storey the foundations had given way, and the
attempts to readjust the work are plainly traceable in the upper
storeys, though without success.out of the
perpendicular,[309] which, though not sufficient to endanger its
stability, is enough to render it very unsightly.Even without this
defect, however, its design can hardly be commended; an arrangement of
six equal arcades, with horizontal entablatures, is not an expedient
mode of adorning a building, where elevation is the element of success.The introduction of strongly-marked vertical lines, or some variation in
the design of the arcades, would have greatly improved the design: and
so the Italians seem to have thought, for it was never repeated, and the
Pisan tower remains a solitary example of its class.Nothing at all resembling it occurs in the southern parts of the
province, though it must be admitted that they contain very few really
important towers of any sort.Perhaps the earthquakes to which a great portion of the country is
liable may have deterred the architects from indulging in structures of
great altitude; but it must be added that the idea of belfry or tower
did not enter into their municipal arrangements, and their towns are not
consequently illustrated by such towers as those of Venice, Cremona, or
Verona in the north.Of those which do exist that of Gaeta is perhaps as
picturesque as any.It was erected 1276-1290, and is both characteristic
of the style and elegant in outline.As will be observed, the lower
storey has pointed arches, while those above are all round; an
arrangement which, though to our eyes it may appear archæologically
wrong, is certainly constructively right, and the effect is very
pleasing, from the height and dignity given to the entrance.The two towers of the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.470) are not so
happy in design as this.They are too tall for their other dimensions,
and want accentuation throughout; while the change from the lower to the
upper storey is abrupt and ill-contrived.The tower at Caserta Vecchia
(Woodcut No.472) is low and squat in its proportions, and unfortunately
too typical of the towers in this land of earthquakes.As a rule, it may be asserted that the southern province of Italy is
singularly deficient in examples of civil or domestic architecture.Great monastic establishments existed there during the Middle Ages which
must have possessed buildings befitting their magnificence; but these
have either perished and been rebuilt, or have been so restored that
their original forms can hardly be recognised.There are, indeed,
cloisters at Amalfi and Sorrento; much more remarkable, however, for the
beauty of their situation than for their architecture, which is
extremely rude and clumsy.There are no chapter-houses: no halls or
conventual buildings of any sort.In this respect, the province forms a
remarkable contrast with Spain in the same age; though it must be
confessed that the North of Italy is also very deficient in conventual
buildings of the Middle Ages, the most magnificent and beautiful
belonging more to the Renaissance than to the Mediæval period.At Ravello there is the Casa Ruffolo, a picturesque palace of the 13th
century, still nearly entire: a strange mixture of Gothic and Saracenic
taste, but so exceptional, that it would not be fair to quote it as a
type of any style.It seems to owe its peculiarities more to the taste
of some individual patron or architect rather than to any national taste
or form of design.There are, however, several Hohenstauffen castles of tolerable
preservation, more or less typical of the domestic arts of the day in
which they were erected.One of the best preserved of these is that of
Castel del Monte, erected by Frederick II., 1240-44.It is an octagon in
plan, with octagonal turrets at each angle.across
its extreme breadth, and surrounds a courtyard 57 ft.Both
storeys are vaulted, and all the details throughout are good and
pleasing.The whole is an admixture of Italian taste, superimposed on a
German design; but it will be observed how little removed the
architectural details of the entrance are, even at that early age, from
the style of the Renaissance.This is, indeed, the great characteristic
of the architectural objects in Southern Italy.Though they adopted
Christian forms, they never abandoned the classical feeling in details;
and it is this which mainly renders them worthy of study.Whether
considered in regard to dimensions, outline, or constructive
peculiarities, their churches will not bear a moment’s comparison with
those of the North; but in elegance of detail they often surpass purely
Gothic buildings to such a degree as to become to some extent as worthy
of study as their more ambitious rivals.Part Section, part Elevation, of Castel del Monte.POINTED ITALIAN GOTHIC.Fresco paintings—Churches at Vercelli, Asti, Verona, and Lucca—Cathedral

Before the commencement of the 13th century, the Italians had acquired
such mastery over the details of their round-arched style, and had
worked it into such originality and completeness, that it is surprising
that they should so easily have abandoned it for that form of Pointed
Gothic which they afterwards adopted.It is true the Italians never rose
to the conception of such buildings as the great Rhenish cathedrals,
like those of Spires and Worms, or the old churches at Cologne; nor did
they perhaps even rival the quasi-classical grace and elegance of the
Provençal churches; but at Verona, Modena, and indeed throughout the
North of Italy, they had elaborated a complete round-arched style, all
the details of which were not only appropriate and elegant, but seemed
capable of indefinite development in the direction in which they were
proceeding.They had also before their eyes the Romanesque style of Pisa
and Lucca with all its elegance, and the example of Rome, where the
architects steadily refused to acknowledge the pointed arch during the
whole of the Mediæval period.Yet in the beginning of the 13th
century—say 1220, when the cathedrals of Amiens, Salisbury, and Toledo
were designed—Italy too was smitten with admiration for the pointed
arch, and set to work to adapt it to her tastes and uses.It would be difficult to account for this, were we not aware how deeply
the feelings that gave rise to the Ghibelline faction were rooted in the
Italian soil.In all the cities, except Rome, the cause of the
Ghibellines was throughout the Middle Ages identified with that of
freedom and local independence, in opposition to that of the Guelfs,
which symbolised the supremacy of the Pope and the clerical party.Knowing how strenuously this was resisted, we naturally expect to find
it expressed in the architecture of the country.Two, indeed, of the
great churches of Italy, Assisi (1228) and Milan (1385), were erected by
Germans in the German style of the day; but these are exceptional.The
form which the pointed-arched style took on its introduction, was that
of adaptation to the Italian style, in a manner which the Italians
thought more consonant with beauty and convenience than that adopted
north of the Alps.The elegance of
the details employed by a refined and cultivated people, and based on
classical traditions, goes far to redeem, in most instances, the defects
of their designs; but they never grasped the true principles of Gothic
art, and the fatal facility of the pointed arch led them more astray
after mechanical clevernesses than even the Germans.Still, it is an
original style, and, however imperfect, is well worthy of study.Before proceeding to describe the style more in detail, it may be well
to point out one of the principal causes which led to the more marked
features of difference between the Gothic architecture of Italy and that
of Germany and France.This was the distaste of the Italians for the
employment of painted glass, or at least their want of appreciation of
its beauties when combined with architecture.It will be explained in a future chapter how all-important painted glass
was to the elaboration of the Gothic style.But for its introduction,
the architecture of France would bear no resemblance to what it was, and
is.In Italy, indeed, the people loved polychromy, but always of the
opaque class.They delighted to cover the walls of their churches with
frescoes and mosaics, to enrich their floors with the most gorgeous
pavements, and to scatter golden stars over the blue ground of their
vaults; but rarely, if ever, did they fill, or design to fill, their
windows with painted glass.Perhaps the glare of an Italian sun may have
tended to render its brilliancy intolerable; but more probably the
absence of stained glass is owing to its incompatibility with
fresco-painting, the effect of which would be entirely destroyed by the
superior brightness of the transparent material.The Italians were not
prepared to relinquish the old and favourite mode of decoration in which
they so excelled.This adherence to the ancient method of ornamentation
enabled them, in the 15th and 16th centuries, to surpass all the world
in the art of painting, but it was fatal to the proper appreciation of
the pointed style, and to its successful introduction into the land.The first effect of this tendency was that the windows in Italian
churches were small, and generally devoid of tracery, with all its
beautiful accompaniments.The walls, too, being consequently solid, were
sufficient, by their own weight, to abut the thrust of the arches: so
that neither projecting or flying buttresses nor pinnacles were needed.The buildings were thus deprived externally of all the aspiring vertical
lines so characteristic of true Gothic.The architects, to relieve the
monotony arising from the want of these features, were forced to recur
to the horizontal cornices of the classical times, and to cover their
walls with a series of panelling which, however beautiful in itself, is
mere ornament—both unmeaning and inconsistent.Internally, too, having no clerestory to make room for, and no
constructive necessities to meet, they jumped to the conclusion that the
best design is that which covers the greatest space with the least
expenditure of materials, and the least encumbrance of the floor.With
builders this is a golden rule, but with architects it is about the
worst that can possibly be adopted.The Germans were not free from this
fault, but the Italians carried it still further.If on four or five
piers they could support the vault of a whole nave, they never dreamed
of introducing more.A French architect, though superior in constructive
skill, would probably have introduced eight or ten in the same space.An
Italian aimed at carrying the vaults of the side-aisles to the same
height as that of the nave, if he could.A Northern architect knew how
to keep the two in their due proportion, whereby he obtained greater
height and greater width in the same bulk, and an appearance of height
and width greater still, by the contrast between the parts, at the same
time that he gave his building a character of strength and stability
perhaps even more valuable than that of size.In the same manner the Northern architects, while they grouped their
shafts together, kept them so distinct as to allow every one to bear its
proportional part of the load, and perform its allotted task.The
Italians never comprehended this principle, but merely stuck pilasters
back to back, in imitation of the true architects, producing an
unmeaning and ugly pier.The same incongruities occur in every part and
every detail.It is a style copied without understanding, and executed
without feeling.The elegance of the sculptured foliage and other
details sometimes goes far to redeem these faults; for the Italians,
though bad architects, were always beautiful carvers, and, as a Southern
people, were free from the vulgarities sometimes apparent farther north,
and never fell into the wild barbarisms which too often disfigure even
the best buildings on this side of the Alps.Besides, when painting is
joined to sculpture in churches, the architecture may come to occupy a
subordinate position, and thus escape the censure it deserves.Unfortunately there are only two examples of any importance in this
style that retain all their painted decorations—St.Francis at Assisi,
and the Certosa near Pavia.From this circumstance they are perhaps the
most admired in Italy.In others the spaces left for colour are still
plain and blank.We see the work of the architect unaided by the
painting which was intended to set it off, and we cannot but condemn it
as displaying at once bad taste and ignorance of the true Gothic
feeling.One of the earliest, or perhaps the very first Italian edifice into
which the pointed arch was introduced, is the fine church of St.Andrea
at Vercelli, commenced in the year 1219 by the Cardinal Guala Bicchieri,
and finished in three years.This prelate, having been long legate in
England, brought back with him an English architect called, it is said,
Brigwithe, and entrusted him with the erection of this church in his
native place.(From Osten’s
‘Baukunst in Lombardei.’) Scale 100 ft.In plan, it is certainly very like an English church, terminating
squarely towards the east, and with side chapels to the transepts,
arranged very much as we find them at Buildwas, Kirkstall, and other
churches of this class and size, only that here they are polygonal,
which was hardly ever the case in England.But with the plan all
influences of the English architect seem to have ceased, and the
structure is in purely Italian style.Externally the pointed arch
nowhere appears, all the doors and windows being circular-headed; while
internally it is confined to the pier-arches of the nave and the
vaulting of the roof.The façade is flanked at its angles by two tall,
slender, square towers; and the intersection of the nave and transept is
covered by one of those elegant octagonal domes which the Italians knew
so well how to use, and which is in fact the only original feature in
their designs.The external form of this church is interesting, as
displaying the germs of much that two centuries afterwards was so
greatly expanded by a German architect in the design of Milan cathedral.A few years later, in 1229, a church was commenced at Asti, the tower of
which was finished in 1266.This allowed time for a more complete
development of the pointed style, which here prevails not only
internally, but externally.Tall pointed windows appear in the flanks,
and even the doorways assume that form, in their canopies, if not in
their openings.493) is a later addition, and a
characteristic specimen of the style during the 14th century.This
church is also one of the earliest examples in which those elegant
terra-cotta cornices of small intersecting arches seem to have been
brought to perfection.(From Chapuy, ‘Moyen-Âge
Monumental.’)]

The most remarkable church of this age is that of St.Francis at Assisi,
commenced in 1228, and finished, in all essentials at least, in 1253.It
is said to have been built by a German named Jacob, or Jacopo.Certainly
no French or English architect would have designed a double church of
this class, though, on the other hand, no Italian could have drawn
details so purely Northern as those of the upper church.In the lower
church there are hardly any mouldings to mark the style, but its
character is certainly rather German than Italian.This church depends
for its magnificence and character much more on painting than on
architecture.In the first place it is small, the upper church being
only 225 ft.width; and though the lower one has
side-aisles which extend the width to 100 ft., yet the upper church is
only 60 ft.in height, and the lower about 30, so that it is far too
small for much architectural magnificence.None of its details are equal
to those of contemporary churches on this side of the Alps.The whole
church is covered with fresco paintings in great variety and of the most
beautiful character, which justly render it one of the most celebrated
and admired of all Italy.On this side of the Alps without its frescoes,
it would hardly attract any attention.It is invaluable as an example of
the extent to which the polychromatic decoration may be profitably
carried, and of the true mode of doing it; and also as an illustration
of the extent to which the Italians allowed a foreign style and mode of
ornamentation to be introduced into their country.One of the purest and most perfect types of an Italian Gothic church is
that of Sta.Anastasia at Verona, commenced apparently in 1260.It is
not large, being only 285 ft.in length externally; but its arrangements
are very complete, and very perfect if looked at from an Italian point
of view.The square of the vault of the nave is the modulus, instead of
that of the aisles, as in true Gothic churches: owing to which the
pier-arches are further apart than a true artist would have placed them;
there are also no buttresses externally, but only pilasters.The
consequence of this is, that the arches have to be tied in with iron
rods at the springing, which internally adds very much to the appearance
of weakness, caused in the first instance by the wide spacing and
general tenuity.These bad effects are aggravated by the absence of a
string-course at the springing of the vault; and by the substitution of
a circular hole for the triforium, and a hexafoiled opening of very
insignificant dimensions for the glorious clerestory windows of Northern
churches.Altogether, though we cannot help being pleased with the
spaciousness and general elegance of design, it is impossible not to
feel how very inferior it is to that of churches on this side the Alps.One Bay, externally and internally, of the Church of
San Martino, Lucca.]The church of San Martino at Lucca, built about a century after Sta.Anastasia (middle of 14th century), presents a strikingly happy
compromise between the two styles.The pier-arches are still too wide—23
ft.in the clear; but the defect is remedied to some extent by the
employment of circular instead of pointed arches, and the triforium is
all that can be desired; the clerestory, however, is as insignificant as
it must be where the sun is so brilliant and painted glass inadmissible.It would be easy to point out other defects; but, taking it altogether,
there are few more elegant churches than this, and hardly one in Italy
that so perfectly meets all the exigencies for which it was designed.(From the ‘Églises
principales d’Europe.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedrals of Siena and Orvieto (the former commenced in 1243, the
latter in 1290) are perhaps, taken altogether, the most successful
specimens of Italian pointed Gothic.They are those at least in which
the system is carried to the greatest extent without either foreign aid
or the application of distinctly foreign details.These two buildings,
moreover, both retain their façades as completed by their first
architects, while the three great churches of this style—the cathedrals
of Florence, Bologna, and Milan—were in this respect left unfinished,
with many others of the smaller churches of Italy.The church at Siena
illustrates forcibly the tendency of the Italian architects to adhere to
the domical forms of the old Etruscans, which the Romans amplified to
such an extent, and the Byzantines made peculiarly their own.I cannot
but repeat my regret that the Italians alone, of all the Western
Mediæval builders, showed any predilection for this form of roof.On
this side of the Alps it could have been made the most beautiful of
architectural forms.In Italy there is no instance of more than moderate
success—nothing, indeed, to encourage imitation.Even the example now
before us is no exception to these remarks, though one of the boldest
efforts of Italian architects.In plan it ought to have been an octagon,
but that apparently would have made it too large for their skill to
execute, so they met the difficulty by adopting a hexagon, which, though
producing a certain variety of perspective, fits awkwardly with the
lines of columns, and twists the vaults to an unpleasant extent.Still,
a dome of moderate height, and 58 ft.in diameter, covering the centre
of the church, and with sufficient space around to give it dignity, is a
noble and pleasing feature, the merit of which it is impossible to deny.Combined with the rich colouring and gorgeous furniture of the church,
it makes up a whole of great beauty.The circular pier-arches, however,
and the black and white stripes by which the exterior is marked, detract
considerably from the effect of the whole—at least in the eyes of
strangers, though the Italians still consider it a beauty.The façade of
this cathedral is represented in Woodcut No.It consists of three
great portals, the arches of which are equal in size, though the centre
doorway is larger than those at the sides.Above is the invariable
circular window of the Italian architects, and the whole is crowned by
steep triangular gables.Beneath the cathedral, or rather under the
choir, is the ancient baptistery, now the church of St.John the
Baptist; its front is in a much purer style of Gothic than the
cathedral.[310]

[Illustration: 498.Façade of the Cathedral at Siena.]The carved architectural ornaments of the façade are rich and elaborate
in the extreme, though figured sculpture is used to a much less extent
than in Northern portals of the same age.It is also observable that the
strong horizontal lines do not harmonise with the aspiring character of
pointed architecture.The cathedral of Orvieto is smaller and simpler, and less rich in its
decorations, than that at Siena, with the exception of its façade, which
is adorned with sculpture and painting.Indeed the three-gabled front
may be considered the typical one for churches of this class.The
façades intended to have been applied to the churches at Florence,
Bologna, Milan, and elsewhere, were no doubt very similar to that
represented in Woodcut No.As a frontispiece, if elaborately
sculptured and painted, it is not without considerable appropriateness
and even beauty; but, as an architectural object, it is infinitely
inferior to the double-towered façades of the Northern cathedrals, or
even to those with only one great tower in the centre.It has besides
the defect of not expressing what is behind it; the central gable being
always higher than the roof, and the two others merely ornamental
appendages.Indeed, like the Italian Gothic buildings generally, it
depended on painting, sculpture, and carving for its effect, far more
than on architectural design properly so called.Among the greatest and most complete examples of Italian Gothic is the
church of Sta.Maria dei Fiori, the cathedral of Florence, one of the
largest and finest churches produced in the Middle Ages—as far as mere
grandeur of conception goes, perhaps the very best, though considerably
marred in execution from defects of style, which are too apparent in
every part.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The building of the church was commenced in the year 1294 or 1298 (it is
not quite clear which), from the designs and under the superintendence
of Arnolfo di Lapo, for unfortunately in this style we know the names of
all the architects, and all the churches show traces of the caprice and
of the misdirected efforts of individuals, instead of the combined
national movement which produced such splendid results in France and
England.It is not known how far Arnolfo had carried the building when
he died, in 1310, but probably up to the springing of the vaults.After
this the works proceeded more leisurely, but the nave and smaller domes
of the choir were no doubt completed as we now find them in the first
twenty years of the 14th century.The great octagon remained unfinished,
and, if covered in at all, it was only by a wooden roof of domical
outline externally, which seems to be that represented in the fresco in
the convent of San Marco, till Brunelleschi commenced the present dome
in 1420, and completed it in all essential parts before his death, which
happened in 1444.The building may therefore be considered as
essentially contemporary with the cathedral of Cologne, which it very
nearly equals in size (its area being 84,802 ft., while that of Cologne
is estimated at 91,000), and, as far as mere conception of plan goes,
there can be little doubt but that the Florentine cathedral far
surpasses its German rival.Nothing indeed can be finer than its general
ground-plan.A vast nave leads to an enormous dome, extending into the
triapsal arrangement so common in the early churches of Cologne, and
which was repeated in the last and greatest effort of the Middle Ages,
or rather the first of the new school—the great church of St.In the Florentine church all these parts are better subordinated
and proportioned than in any other example, and the mode in which the
effect increases and the whole expands as we approach from the entrance
to the sanctum is unrivalled.Like all inexperienced architects, Arnolfo seems to have
thought that largeness of parts would add to the greatness of the whole,
and thus used only four great arches in the whole length of his nave,
giving the central aisle a width of 55 ft.of that of Cologne, and the height about the same; and
yet, in appearance, the height is about half, and the breadth less than
half, owing to the better proportion of the parts and to the superior
appropriateness in the details on the part of the German cathedral.At
Florence the details are positively ugly.The windows of the side-aisles
are small and misplaced, those of the clerestory mere circular holes.The proportion of the aisles one to another is bad, the vaults
ill-formed, and altogether a colder and less effective design was not
produced in the Middle Ages.The triapsal choir is not so objectionable
as the nave, but there are large plain spaces that now look cold and
flat; the windows are too few and small, and there is a gloom about the
whole which is very unsatisfactory.It is nearly certain that the
original intention was to paint the walls, and not to colour the
windows, so that these defects are hardly chargeable to the original
design, and would not be apparent now were it not that in a moment of
mistaken enthusiasm the Florentines were seized with a desire to imitate
the true style of Gothic art, and rival Northern cathedrals in the glory
of their painted glass.This, in a church whose windows were designed
only of such dimensions as were sufficient to admit the requisite
quantity of white light, was fatal.Notwithstanding the beauty of the
glass itself, which seems to have been executed at Lubeck, 1434, from
Italian designs, it is so completely out of place that it only produces
irritation instead of admiration, and has certainly utterly destroyed
the effect and meaning of the interior it was intended to adorn.Section of Dome and part of Nave of the Cathedral at
Florence.Part of the Flank of Cathedral at Florence.]Dome at Chiaravalle, near Milan.Externally the façade was never finished,[311] and we can only fancy
what was intended from the analogy of Siena and Orvieto.The flanks of
the nave are without buttresses or pinnacles, and, with only a few
insignificant windows, would be painfully flat except for a veneer of
 marbles disposed in panels over the whole surface.For an
interior or a pavement such a mode of decoration is admissible; but it
is so unconstructive, so evidently a mere decoration, that it gives a
weakness to the whole, and most unsatisfactory appearance to so large a
building.This is much less apparent at the east end, where the outline
is so broken, and the main lines of the construction so plainly marked,
that the mere filling in is comparatively unimportant.This is the most
meritorious part of the church, and, so far as it was carried up
according to the original design, is extremely beautiful.Even the
plainness and flatness of the nave serve as a foil to set off the
varying outline of the choir.Above the line of the cornice of the
side-aisles there is nothing that can be said to belong to the original
design except the first division of the drum of the dome, which follows
the lines of the clerestory.It has long been a question what Arnolfo
originally intended, and especially how he meant to cover the great
octagonal space in the centre.All knowledge of his intentions seems to
have been lost within a century after his death: at least, in the
accounts of the proceedings of the commission which resulted in the
adoption of Brunelleschi’s design for the dome, no reference is made to
any original design as then existing, and no one appears to have known
how Arnolfo intended to finish his work.Judging from the structure as
far as he carried it, and with the knowledge we now possess of the
Italian architecture of that age, we can easily conjecture what his
design for its completion may have been.Internally, it probably
consisted of a dome something like the present, but flatter, springing
from the cornice, 40 ft.lower than the present one, and pierced with
large openings on each of its eight faces.Section of Eastern portion of Church at Chiaravalle.(From Gruner’s ‘Terra Cotta Architecture in Italy.’) Scale 50 ft.Externally, two courses were open to him.The first and most obvious was
to hide the dome entirely under a wooden roof, as is done in St.George’s, Thessalonica (Woodcut No.305), or in the baptistery in front
of the cathedral, and is done in half the baptisteries in Italy—as at
Parma, for instance (Woodcut No.Had he done this, the span of the
dome might have been very much larger, without involving any
constructive difficulties, and the three towers over the choir and
transepts might have sufficed to relieve its external appearance
sufficiently for architectural effect.On the whole, however, I am
rather inclined to believe that something more ambitious than this was
originally proposed, and that the design was more like that of
Chiaravalle near Milan, built in 1221, and one of the most complete and
perfect of this class of dome now existing in Italy.Its external
appearance may be judged of from Woodcut 502, and its constructive
details from the section, Woodcut No.If the basement is sufficiently solid—and that at Florence is more than
sufficient for any superstructure of the sort—it is evident the
architect can dispose of such masses of masonry, that he can counteract
any thrust or tendency to spread that can exist in any dome of this
sort; and instead of being only 136 ft.across, 150 or 160 might easily
have been attempted.Instead of 375 ft., which is the height of the
present dome from the floor to the top of the cross externally, it might
even with the present diameter have been carried up to at least 500 ft.,
or as high as the church was long,—70 to 100 ft.Had this been done, the three smaller semi-domes must have been intended
to be crowned with miniature octagonal spires of the same class with the
great dome, and between these the vast substructures show that it was
intended to carry up four great spires, probably to a height of 400 ft.Had all this been done (and something very like it seems certainly to
have been intended), neither Cologne Cathedral, nor any church in
Europe, ancient or modern, would have been comparable to this great and
glorious apse.As it is, the plain, heavy, simple outlined dome of
Brunelleschi acts like an extinguisher, crushing all the lower part of
the composition, and both internally and externally destroying all
harmony between the parts.It has deprived us of the only chance that
ever existed of witnessing the effect of a great Gothic dome; not indeed
such a dome as might with the same dimensions have been executed on this
side of the Alps, but still in the spirit, and with much of the poetry,
which gives such value to the conceptions of the builders in those days.But for this change of plan, the ambition of the Florentines might have
been in some measure satisfied, whose instructions to the architect
were, that their cathedral “should surpass everything that human
industry or human power had conceived of great and beautiful.”

About a century later (1390), the Bolognese determined on the erection
of a monster cathedral, which, in so far as size went, would have been
more than double that at Florence.According to the plans that have come
down to us, it was to have been about 800 ft.long and 525 wide across
the transepts; at the intersection was to have been a dome 130 ft.in
diameter, or only 6 ft.less than that at Florence; and the width of
both nave and transepts was to have been 183 ft.: so that the whole
would have covered about 212,000 ft., or nearly the same area as St.Peter’s at Rome, and three times that of any French cathedral!Of this
vast design, only about one-third (Woodcut No.ft., was
ever carried out; but that fragment is quite sufficient to enable us to
judge of the merits or defects of this style in its state of greatest
perfection.The only other building in the same style on a sufficient
scale to admit of comparison with this is the nave of the cathedral at
Florence just described, but that is nearly as may be only half of its
dimensions, or 36,000 ft.The chapels, too, at
Bologna add practically a fifth aisle, giving great variety and richness
to the perspective.The varied heights and proportions of the central
and side aisles are singularly pleasing, and there being six arches at
Bologna instead of only four as at Florence, and twelve side chapels
where none exist in the other example, go far to redeem the lean
mechanical look which is the great defect of this style.The great
advantage San Petronio has over the Florentine church is in the size and
number of its windows, and these not being filled with stained glass the
whole church has a bright and pleasing effect that contrasts most
favourably with the gloom of its great rival.Notwithstanding this, the
nave of San Petronio cannot be considered as a successful work of art.In the first place it is too mechanically perfect.The area of the
points of support as compared with the voids is, as far as can be made
out from such plans as exist, about one-twelfth, which would be a merit
in a railway station, but something more is wanted in a monumental
building.In the next there is a singular deficiency of either
constructive or constructed ornament.On this side of the Alps an
architect with vaulting shafts, string-courses, galleries, and fifty
other expedients, would have relieved the bareness of the walls.At
Bologna it probably was intended they should be painted, and this never
having been executed may account for most of its apparent defects.In Gothic architecture one of two systems seems indispensable: either
painted glass with strongly-marked carved mouldings over the whole of
the interior, or white glass with flat surfaces suitable for opaque
paintings.Few cathedrals are complete in both respects at the present
day, but in their imperfect state the Northern system has an immense
advantage over the Southern.The architecture of our cathedrals is
complete and beautiful even in ruins.An Italian church without its
 decoration is only a framed canvas without harmony or meaning.Were San Petronio as complete in its  decoration as the Certosa
at Pavia or Monreale at Palermo, it might stand a fair competition with
the best interiors on this side of the Alps.As it is, it is only a
splendid example of ornamental but unornamented construction, and, as
was attempted to be explained in the Introduction, both elements are
wanted for success in architectural design.Section of San Petronio, Bologna.The exterior of the church is in too unfinished a state to enable us to
judge of what its effect might have been if completed, but many of its
details, especially of the façade, are of very great beauty, in many
respects superior to what is to be found on this side of the Alps.Its
central dome, however, never could have been a feature worthy of so vast
a church.In diameter it is equal, or nearly so, to that of Florence,
but the points of support are so small, and so far apart, that it must
have been mainly if not wholly of wood.No such towering structure as
Arnolfo’s vast substructures show that he intended, could have stood on
the slim supports of the Bolognese church.[312]

[Illustration: 506.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali d’Europa.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedral of Milan—at once the most remarkable and one of the
largest and richest of all the churches erected in the Middle Ages—was
commenced in the year 1385, by order of Gian Galeazzo, first Duke of
Milan, and consecrated in 1418, at which date all the essential parts
seem to have been completed, though the central spire was not finished
till about the year 1440, by Brunelleschi.The design is said to have been furnished by a German architect,
Heinrich Arlez von Gemunden, or as the Italians call him, “da
Gamondia,”—a statement which is corroborated by the fact that the
details and many of the forms are essentially Northern; but it is
equally certain that he was not allowed to control the whole, for all
the great features of the church are as thoroughly Italian as the
details are German: it is therefore by no means improbable that Marco da
Campione, as the Italians assert, or some other native artist, was
joined with him or placed over him.In size it is, except Seville, the largest of all Mediæval cathedrals,
covering 107,782 ft.In material it is the richest, being built wholly
of white marble, which is scarcely the case with any other church, large
or small; and in decoration it is the most gorgeous—the whole of the
exterior is covered with tracery, and the amount of carving and statuary
lavished on its pinnacles and spires is unrivalled in any other building
of Europe.It is also built wholly (with the exception of the façade)
according to one design.Yet, with all these advantages, the appearance
of this wonderful building is not satisfactory to any one who is
familiar with the great edifices on this side of the Alps.Cologne is
certainly more beautiful; Rheims, Chartres, Amiens, and Bourges leave a
far more satisfactory impression on the mind; and even the much smaller
church of St.Ouen will convey far more pleasure to the true artist than
this gorgeous temple.The cause of all this it is easy to understand, since all or nearly all
its defects arise from the introduction of Italian features into a
Gothic building; or rather, perhaps, it should be said, from a German
architect being allowed to ornament an Italian cathedral.Petronio at Bologna as our standard of
comparison, it will be seen that the sections (Woodcuts Nos.505, 507)
are almost identical both in dimensions and in form, except that at
Milan the external range is a real aisle instead of a series of side
chapels; but, at the same time, it will be perceived that the German
system prevailed in doubling the number of the piers between the nave
and side-aisles.So far, therefore, the German architect saved the
church.The two small clerestories, however, still remain; and although
the design avoids the mullionless little circles of Bologna, there is
only space for small openings, which more resemble the windows of an
attic than of a clerestory.The greater quantity of light being thus
introduced by the tall windows of the outer aisle, the appearance is
that of a building lighted from below, which is fatal to architectural
effect.The model still preserved on the spot shows that the German architect
designed great portals at each end of the transepts.This, however, was
overruled in favour of two small polygonal apses.Instead of the great
octagonal dome which an Italian would have placed upon the intersection
of the whole width of the nave and transepts, German influence has
confined it to the central aisle, which is perhaps more to be regretted
than any other mistake in the building.The choir is neither a French
chevet nor a German or Italian apse, but a compromise between the two, a
French circlet of columns enclosed in a German polygonal termination.This part of the building, with its simple forms and three glorious
windows, is perhaps an improvement on either of the models of which it
is compounded.[313] (From
Wiebeking.)This is the nearest approach to the French chevet arrangement to be
found in all Italy.It is extremely rare in that country to find an
aisle running round the choir, and opening into it, or with the circlet
of apsidal chapels which is so universal in France.The Italian church
is not, in fact, derived from a combination of a circular Eastern church
with a Western rectangular nave, but is a direct copy from the old Roman
basilica.The details of the interior of Milan cathedral are almost wholly German
(Woodcut No.The great capitals of the pillars, with their niches
and statues, are the only compromise between the ordinary German form
and the great deep ugly capitals—fragments, in fact, of classical
entablatures—which disfigure the cathedrals of Florence and Bologna, and
so many other Italian churches.Had the ornamentation of these been
carried up to the springing of the vault, they would have been
unexceptionable; as it is, with all their richness, their effect is
unmeaning.Externally, the appearance is in outline not unlike that of Sta.Maria
dei Fiori; the apse is rich, varied, and picturesque, and the central
dome (excepting the details) similar, though on a smaller scale, to what
I believe to have been the original design of the Florentine church.The
nave is nearly as flat as at Florence, the clerestory not being visible;
but the forest of pinnacles and flying buttresses and the richness of
the ornamentation go far to hide that defect.The façade was left
unfinished, as was so often the case with the great churches of Italy.Pellegrini was afterwards employed to finish it, and a model of his
design is still preserved.It is fortunate that his plan was not carried
out.The façade was finished, as we now see it, from the designs of
Amati, by order of Napoleon.It is commonplace, as might be expected
from its age, but inoffensive.The doorways are part of Pellegrini’s
design, and the Mediæval forms being placed over those of the
cinque-cento, produce a strangely incongruous effect.For the west front
several original designs are still preserved.One of these, with two
small square towers at the angles, as at Vercelli and elsewhere, was no
doubt the Italian design.509) is preserved
by Bassi:[314] had this been executed, the façade would have been about
one-third (viz.Had the height of
the towers been in the same proportion, they would have been the tallest
in the world.In that case the effect here, as at Cologne, would have
been to shorten and overpower the rest of the building to a painful
extent.A design midway between the two, with spires rising to the same
height as the central one, or about 360 ft., would perhaps have the
happiest effect.At any rate, the want of some such features is greatly
felt in the building as it stands.The Certosa, near Pavia, was commenced about the same date (1396) as the
cathedral at Milan.It is seldom that we find two buildings in the
Middle Ages so close to one another in date and locality, and yet so
dissimilar.There is no instance of such an occurrence on this side of
the Alps, till modern times; and it shows that in those days the
Italians were nearly as devoid of any distinct principles of
architecture as we have since become.View of the Certosa, near Pavia.The great difference between Pavia and Milan is that the former shows no
trace of foreign influence.Petronio, and
by no means so complete or consistent in design.Nothing, in fact, can
be more painful than the disproportion of the parts, the bad drawing of
the details, the malformation of the vaults, and the meanness of the
windows; though all these defects are completely hidden by the most
gorgeous colouring, and by furniture of such richness as to be almost
unrivalled.So attractive are these two features to the majority of
spectators, and so easily understood, that nine visitors out of ten are
delighted with the Certosa, and entirely forget its miserable
architecture in the richness and brilliancy of its decorations.Externally the architecture is better than in the interior.From its
proximity to Pavia, it retains its beautiful old galleries under the
roof.Its circular apses, with their galleries, give to this church, for
the age to which it belongs, a peculiar character, harmonising well with
the circular-headed form, which nearly all the windows and openings
present.Even in the interior there are far more circular than pointed
arches.The most beautiful and wonderful part of the building is the façade.This was begun in 1473, and is one of the best specimens in Italy of the
Renaissance style.It would hardly, therefore, be appropriate to mention
it here, were it not that the dome over the intersection of the nave and
transepts is of the same age and style, but reproduces so exactly
(except in details) what we fancy the Mediæval Italian Gothic dome to
have been, that it may be considered as a feature of the earlier ages.502, it will be seen how like it is to that of
Chiaravalle in outline.It is less tall, however, and, if translated
into the details of the great church at Florence, would fit perfectly on
the basement there prepared for such a feature.Like many other churches in Northern Italy, the principal parts of the
Certosa are built in brick, and the ornamental details executed in
terra-cotta.Some of the latter, especially in the cloisters, are as
beautiful as any executed in stone in any part of Italy during the
Middle Ages; and their perfect preservation shows how suitable is the
material for such purposes.It may not be appropriate for large details
or monumental purposes, but for the minor parts and smaller details,
when used as the Italians in the Middle Ages used it, terra-cotta is as
legitimate as any material anywhere used for building purposes; and in
situations like the alluvial plains of the Po, where stone is with
difficulty obtainable, its employment was not only judicious but most
fortunate in its results.It would be a tedious and unprofitable task to attempt to particularise
all the churches which were erected in this style in Italy, as hardly
one of them possesses a single title to admiration beyond the very
vulgar one of size.To this Santa Croce, at Florence, adds its
association with the great men who lie buried beneath it, and Sta.Maria
Novella can plead the circumstance—exceptional in that city—of
possessing a façade;[315] but neither of these has anything to redeem
its innate ugliness in the eyes of an architect.There are two great churches of this period at Venice, the San Giovanni
e Paolo (1246-1420) and the Frari (1250); they are large and richly
ornamented fabrics, but are both entirely destitute of architectural
merit.(From Hope’s ‘Architecture.’)
Scale 50 ft.A much more beautiful building is the cathedral at Como, the details of
which are so elegant and so unobtrusively used as in great measure to
make up for the bad arrangement and awkward form of the whole.In design
it is, however, inferior to that of the Duomo at Ferrara (Woodcut No.The latter does not display the richness of the façades of Siena
or Orvieto, nor the elegance of that last named; but among the few
Italian façades which exist, it stands pre-eminent for sober propriety
of design and the good proportions of all its parts.The repose caused
by the solidity of the lower portions, and the gradual increase of
ornament and lightness as we ascend, all combine to render it harmonious
and pleasing.It is true it wants the aspiring character and bold relief
of Northern façades; but these do not belong to the style, and it must
suffice if we meet in this style with a moderate amount of variety,
undisturbed by any very prominent instances of bad taste.The true type of an Italian façade is well illustrated in the view of
St.Francesco at Brescia (Woodcut No.512), which may be considered the
germ of all that followed.Whether the church had three aisles or five,
the true Italian façade in the age of pointed architecture was always a
modification or extension of this idea, though introduced with more or
less Gothic feeling according to the circumstances of its erection.At Florence there is a house or warehouse, converted into a church,—Or
(horreum) San Michele, which has attracted a good deal of attention, but
more on account of its curious ornaments than for beauty of design—which
latter it does not, and indeed can hardly be expected to, possess.Maria della Spina at Pisa owes its celebrity to
the richness of its niches and canopies, and to the sculpture which they
contain.In this the Italians were always at home, and probably always
surpassed the Northern nations.It was far otherwise with architecture,
properly so called.This, in the age of the pointed style, was in Italy
so cold and unmeaning, that we do not wonder at the readiness with which
the Italians returned to the classical models.They are to be forgiven
in this, but we cannot so easily forgive _our_ forefathers, who
abandoned a style far more beautiful than that of Italy to copy one
which they had themselves infinitely surpassed; and this only because
the Italians, unable either to comSprehend or imitate the true
principles of pointed art, were forced to abandon its practice.Unfortunately for us, they had in this respect in that age sufficient
influence to set the fashion to all Europe.(From Street’s
‘Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages.’)]

Of late work in Dalmatia the most remarkable is the Cathedral of
Sebenico (described in Mr.Jackson’s work), built entirely in stone and
marble, and without any brick or timber in its construction.It is a
cruciform building, covered over by a waggon-vault of stone, visible
both inside and outside.It was commenced from the design of Messer
Ambrosia, a Venetian architect, in 1435, to whom may be attributed the
nave and aisles up to the string-course above nave arches.The work was
continued after 1441 by another architect, Messer Giorgio, also from
Venice, who died in 1475, leaving the building still incomplete.The
style of the work is late Venetian Gothic, influenced in its later
portions by the Renaissance revival.The cloisters of the Badia at
Curzola, and of the Dominican and Franciscan convents at Ragusa, are
also beautiful specimens of late Italian Gothic.----------------------------

  Max Müller, who is the _facile princeps_ of the linguistic school in
  this country—in an inaugural lecture which he delivered when, it was
  understood, he was appointed to a chair in the Strasburg
  University—gave up all that has hitherto been contended for by his
  followers.He admitted that language, though an invaluable aid, did
  not suffice for the purposes of the investigation, and that the
  results obtained by its means were not always to be depended upon.Footnote 17:

  The term “Persistent Varieties” has recently been introduced, instead
  of “race,” in ethnological nomenclature, and, if scientific accuracy
  is aimed at, is no doubt an improvement.It is an advantage to have a
  term which does not even in appearance prejudge any of the questions
  between the monogenists and polygenists, and leaves undecided all the
  questions how the variations of mankind arose.But it sounds pedantic;
  and “race” may be understood as meaning the same thing.Footnote 18:

  The whole of this subject has been carefully gone into by the Author
  in a work entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ published in 1872, to which
  the reader is referred.Footnote 19:

  All round the shores of the Mediterranean are found the traces of an
  art which has hitherto been a stumbling-block to antiquarians.Egyptian cartouches and ornaments in Assyria, which are not Egyptian;
  sarcophagi at Tyre, of Egyptian form, but with Phœnician inscriptions,
  and made for Tyrian kings; Greek ornaments in Syria, which are not
  Greek; Roman frescoes or ornaments, and architectural details at
  Carthage, and all over Northern Africa, which however are not Roman.In short, a copying art something like our own, imitating everything,
  understanding nothing.Franks for the
  suggestion that all this art may be Phœnician, in other words,
  Semitic, and I believe he is right.Footnote 20:

  Had there been no Pelasgi in Greece, there probably would have been no
  Architecture of the Grecian period.Footnote 21:

  The derivation of the two words Heathen and Pagan seems to indicate
  the relative importance of these two terms very much in the degree it
  is here wished to express.Heathen is generally understood to be
  derived from ἔθνος, a nation or people; and Pagan from _Pagus,
  Pagani_, a village, or villagers.Both are used here not as terms of
  reproach, but as indicative of their being non-Christian, which is
  what it is wished to express, and was the original intention of the
  term.Footnote 22:

  By a singular coincidence, China has been suffering from a Hyksos
  domination of Tartar conquerors, precisely as Egypt did after the
  period of the Pyramid builders, and, strange to say, for about the

  This will be best understood by looking at the section (Woodcut 7), in
  which it will be seen that the so-called coping or casing-stones were
  not simply triangular blocks, filling up the angles formed by the
  receding steps, and which might have been easily displaced, but stones
  from 7 to 10 feet in depth, which could not have been supported unless
  the work had been commenced at the bottom.On the other hand, it is
  difficult to understand how the casing-stones for the upper portion
  could have been raised up the sloping portion completed.It is
  probable, therefore, that the casing was commenced at the angles and
  was carried up in vertical planes, thus leaving a causeway of steps in
  the middle of each face, which diminished in width as the work
  proceeded; this causeway, a few feet wide only, on each face being
  then encased from the top downwards after the apex blocks had been
  laid.—ED.Footnote 31:

  I have ventured to restore the roof of the cella with a sikra (ziggur
  or ziggurah, according to Rawlinson’s ‘Five Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.395, et passim), from finding similar roofs at Susa, Bagdad,
  Keffeli, &c. They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some
  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it
  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which
  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic
  architecture.Footnote 73:

  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,
  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess
  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the
  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a
  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which
  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,
  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200
  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20
  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,
  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole
  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.
  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives
  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the
  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more
  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously
  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general
  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:

  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all
  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information
  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The
  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference
  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since
  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings
  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom
  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than
  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,
  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the
  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire
  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded
  to.Footnote 78:

  Published in 1862, in the ‘Athenæum’ journal, No.Footnote 79:

  This plan, with all the particulars here mentioned, are taken from
  Layard’s work, which is the only authority on the subject, so that it
  is not necessary to refer to him on every point.The plan is reduced
  to the usual scale of 100 ft.to 1 inch, for easy comparison with the
  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:

  The whole of the information regarding Khorsabad is taken from M.
  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et
  l’Assyrie,’ by M. Victor Place.Footnote 81:

  These particulars are all borrowed from M. Place’s great work, ‘Ninive
  et l’Assyrie,’ folio.Footnote 82:

  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this
  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the
  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis
  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the
  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published
  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on
  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent
  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general
  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over
  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never
  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been
  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such
  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and
  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time
  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were
  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of
  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because
  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such
  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the
  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so
  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them
  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in
  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were
  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of
  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two
  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.According to M. Place they formed
  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would
  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry
  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the
  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The
  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high
  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the
  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls
  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:

  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,
  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand
  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their
  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side
  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had
  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:

  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or
  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase
  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained
  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor
  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just
  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was
  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:

  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having
  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a
  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:

  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the
  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before
  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:

  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:

  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;
  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:

  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric
  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:

  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note
  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by
  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s
  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to
  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians
  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,
  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the
  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,
  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:

  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from
  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is
  mentioned.Footnote 93:

  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and
  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its
  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:

  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is
  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,
  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to
  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily
  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller
  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:

  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square
  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at
  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations
  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the
  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features
  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear
  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the
  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by
  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld
  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain
  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the
  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which
  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the
  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the
  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the
  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have
  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its
  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the
  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:

  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,
  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add
  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion
  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of
  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left
  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the
  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and
  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:

  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;
  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,
  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:

  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which
  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four
  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,
  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed
  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or
  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the
  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the
  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit
  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:

  the outstanding questions with reference to this celebrated building.I have in consequence written and published a monograph of the Temple,

  “Toward the centre of the monument two large stones were found leaning
  at an angle the one against the other, and forming a sort of tent,
  like in Woodcut 124, under which was presently discovered a small
  statue of Minerva seated on a chariot with four horses, and an urn of
  metal filled with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones.This urn, which is
  now in the possession of the Comte de Choiseul, is enriched in
  sculpture with a vine branch, from which is suspended bunches of
  grapes done with exquisite art.”—‘Description of the Plain of Troy,’
  translated by Dalzel, Edin.If this is so, this is no doubt the vessel mentioned, ‘Iliad,’ xvi.92; ‘Od.,’ xxiv.and why has not the fact of its existence been more insisted upon?Footnote 118:

  One of the most interesting facts brought to light in Dr.Schliemann’s
  excavations is that between the age of the “Ilium Vetus” of Homer,
  rich in metals and in arts, and the “Ilium Novum” of Strabo, a people
  ignorant of use of the metals, and using only bone and stone
  implements, inhabited the mound at Hissarlik which covered both these
  cities.This discovery is sufficient to upset the once fashionable
  Danish theory of the three ages—Stone, Bronze, and Iron—but,
  unfortunately, adds nothing to our knowledge of architecture.These
  people, whoever they were, built nothing, and must consequently be
  content to remain in the “longa nocte” of those who neglect the Master
  Art.Footnote 119:

  This tomb is considered by M. Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)
  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:
  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their
  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all
  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with
  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked
  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it
  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”
  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,
  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large
  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:

  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut
  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be
  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:

  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to
  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the
  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick
  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls
  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no
  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative
  features, of which so many others are found in the style.Footnote 130:

  The dimensions are 94 feet by 45, covering consequently only 4230
  feet.Footnote 132:

  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the
  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks
  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration
  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,
  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was
  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring
  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:

  M. J. Thacher Clarke, who directed the American expedition in 1881, is

  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of
  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described
  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another
  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,
  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is
  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of
  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the
  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:

  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:

  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than
  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this
  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden
  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and
  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the
  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson
  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further
  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries
  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;
  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera
  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The
  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in
  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at
  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,
  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to
  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up
  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the
  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the
  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the
  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,
  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of
  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes
  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric
  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:

  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his
  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the
  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti
  Society.Footnote 139:

  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian
  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and
  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly
  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of
  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:

  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some
  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural
  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and
  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other
  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed
  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at
  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:

  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:

  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an
  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles
  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was
  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in
  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his
  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter
  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the
  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his
  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on
  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another
  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to
  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof
  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned
  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by
  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the
  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple
  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the
  lighting of the temples of antiquity in this way—that a few great
  dipteral hypæthral temples existed, but that the Greek and Roman
  temples had as a rule no light from above, and were only lighted from
  the door.”—ED.]Footnote 143:

  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,
  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole
  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his
  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,
  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,
  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open
  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the
  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,
  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the
  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light
  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting
  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have
  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the
  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems
  simply impossible.Footnote 149:

  “Universo Templo longitudo est ccccxxv.Columnæ
  centum viginti septem a singulis regibus factæ, lx.pedum altitudine:
  ex iis xxxvi.cælatæ, una a Scopa.”—H.Wood places two in the pronaos and two in the posticum, thus
  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a
  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the
  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to
  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:

  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls
  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have
  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various
  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were
  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of
  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best
  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors
  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek
  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a
  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing
  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:

  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this
  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on
  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also
  refer to the restoration suggested by M. Pullan in the work published
  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with
  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns
  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite
  repugnant to any student of Greek architecture.—ED.]Footnote 155:

  The circumstance of Asoka, the Buddhist king of India B.C.250, having

  A diagram is given in ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art’ p.459,

  These two temples, like almost all the others of Rome, have recently
  been renamed by the Roman or rather German antiquaries.The Jupiter
  Tonans is now the Temple of Saturn, and the Jupiter Stator is decreed
  to have been the Temple of Castor and Pollux.The names by which they
  are currently known has been adhered to, as the architecture is of
  more importance here than the archæology.Footnote 167:

  When the first edition of this work was written I believed the rotunda
  to have been added to the portico by Severus; and if this were so it
  would get over many of the difficulties arising from its size and the
  character of its brickwork.My personal examination, however, has
  forced me very unwillingly to give up this hypothesis.It certainly
  is, however, very astonishing that such a vault should have been
  attempted at so early an age.[There seems to be some probability that Mr.Fergusson’s first belief
  was correct, and that the Rotunda was built by Hadrian, bricks with
  the stamp of his period having been found in the casing and in the
  bond courses in the solid concrete both of the drum and in the dome.The discovery is due to M. Chedanne, one of the “Grand Prix” students
  in the Villa Medici, who had selected the subject for his “Envoi de
  Rome,” and was allowed to superintend certain repairs and restorations
  which were required in the Pantheon.It would seem that the portico
  erected by Agrippa preceded a temple with cella of the ordinary form,
  the pavement of which has been found nearly seven feet below the floor
  of the present church.From this it follows that when the Rotunda was
  erected in the first half of the second century, the portico, which is
  undoubtedly of Agrippa’s time, must have been taken down and rebuilt
  on to it, and this explains Mr.Fergusson’s reasons for insisting that
  the portico was built on to the Rotunda.The theory as to the Pantheon
  forming part of Agrippa’s bath is thus disposed of.Independently of
  that, however, Prof.Middleton has pointed out that the discoveries
  made in 1882, by the removal of the block of houses at the back,
  showed that there was no connection whatever between the two
  buildings.Traces exist of the original marble lining, and of cornices
  which were continued round the dome, showing that originally the
  complete circuit was exposed to view.Middleton
  states, “if further proof were wanting to contradict the theory that
  the Pantheon was over the Calidarum or Laconicum of the bath, this is
  supplied by the fact that there is no trace of any hypocaust under the
  floor, but merely an ancient drain to carry away the rain-water that
  fell through the opening in the dome.The Pantheon, too, is on the
  north side of the Thermæ—a very improbable position for the Laconicum,
  or hot room, which was usually placed on the sunny side of the
  buildings.”—ED.]Footnote 170:

  The bronze plates which were removed by Pope Urban VIII.in 1626 to
  make cannon, and also for the great Baldachino in St.Peter’s, were
  taken from the portico; the coffers of the interior of the dome were
  decorated, according to Prof.Middleton, with mouldings in stucco
  painted and gilt.Footnote 171:

  This building is commonly called a temple, though it is not known to
  what deity it was dedicated.My own impression is that it was a tomb,
  or at least a funereal monument of some sort.Footnote 172:

  Owing to a misreading of Vitruvius’s statement respecting the temple
  it had always been classed as decastyle.Penrose’s researches
  published in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Institute of British
  Architects,’ vol.Footnote 173:

  See ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ where the reasons for this
  arrangement will be found stated at length.[See note on page
  272.—ED.]Footnote 174:

  Canina, in his restoration, shows a flat roof with coffers, so there
  is probably no exact authority for its form, though it seems to be
  generally agreed that the centre was not hypæthral.Footnote 175:

  This basilica is generally represented as having an apse at either
  end; but there is no authority whatever for this, and general analogy
  would lead us rather to infer that it was not the case.Middleton, however, is of opinion that an apse existed at both ends,
  and shows the same in his restoration of the plan of Trajan’s
  form.—‘The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ by J. H. Middleton, Fig.Footnote 176:

  One of the pillars of this basilica remained _in situ_ till the year
  1614, when it was removed by Carlo Maderno, by order of Paul V., and
  re-erected in the piazza of St.M. Maggiore, where it now stands as a
  monumental column, supporting a statue of the Virgin.The column, with
  its base and capital, is as nearly as may be 60 ft.in height; the
  whole monument, as it now stands, 140 ft.Footnote 177:

  As it was sunk slightly below the pavement of the peristyle, and
  drains leading from it were traced by Mr.Ashpitel, it was probably
  hypæthral.Footnote 178:

  The theatres of Curio and Scaurus were in timber, except the
  proscenium of the latter, which was partly decorated with marble and
  mosaics.The Theatre of Pompey, B.C.54, was in stone, and parts of it
  still exist (Prof.The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by
  Julius Cæsar, but not completed till 13 B.C., when it was opened by
  Augustus.It was subsequently restored after a fire by Vespasian, but
  the purity and simplicity of the architecture, and the refinement of
  the details, in comparison with those of the Colosseum, 70-80 A.D.,
  are in favour of the earlier date assigned to it.Middleton
  quotes another theatre, that of Cornelius Balbus (13 B.C.), built to
  the north-west of the Theatre of Marcellus.Middleton the Amphitheatre of Sutrium is of Roman
  origin, and but little earlier than the Colosseum at Rome.“There is
  really no evidence,” he says (p.76), “that amphitheatres were built
  by the Etruscans; and there can be little doubt that they were purely
  Roman inventions.”

Footnote 180:

  At the Crystal Palace it has always been found necessary to allow 6

  Considerable difference of opinion seems to exist as to the extent of
  the velaria which sheltered the arena; this was supported by masts
  fixed outside the upper part of the walls, resting on brackets, 14 ft.below the cornice, which was cut away to allow the mast to fit close
  against the wall.M. Gérôme suggests, in his well-known picture of the
  Roman gladiators, that the velaria extended over a portion of the
  arena only.Middleton states, “The awning did not, as has been
  sometimes supposed, cover the whole amphitheatre, a thing which would
  have been practically impossible, owing to the enormous strain of so
  long a bearing, far beyond what any ropes could bear.It simply sloped
  down over the spectators in the cavea, leaving the whole central arena
  uncovered.” In case of rain, however, this might have been
  inconvenient, and it would not have protected the spectators from the
  sun, supposing that the performances lasted the whole day.Besides,
  there is no reason why the masts should have been carried so high
  above the wall, as shown in the restoration in Prof.Middleton’s book,
  p.Alma Tadema is of opinion that the velarium extended over
  the whole arena, and was suspended on a principle similar to that of a
  suspension bridge, the ridge, or highest portion lying between the
  foci of the ellipse.This accounts in a much more satisfactory way for
  the height of the masts, and would afford facilities for the draining
  off of the rain on to the top of the gallery round.Footnote 182:

  These baths have been carefully measured by M. Blouet, who has also
  published a restoration of them.This is, on the whole, certainly the
  best account we have of any of these establishments.Middleton this magnificent hall appears to have
  been what Spartianus calls the _cella soliaris_, the ceiling of which
  he says was formed of interlaced bars of gilt bronze.When the
  excavations in this hall were being made, many tons of fragments of
  iron girders were found.Aitchison)
  compound girders, formed of two T bars riveted together, and then
  cased in bronze.A sort of lattice-work ceiling had been formed with
  these bronze-cased girders, the panels being probably filled in with
  concrete made of light pumice-stone, worked with fine stucco reliefs,
  painted and gilt.Middleton is of opinion that the central part
  over the swimming-bath was left open for the admission of light.In
  the upper part of the walls deep sinkings to receive the ends of the
  great girders which supported the ceiling are clearly visible.George’s Hall at Liverpool is the most exact copy in modern times
  of a part of these baths.The Hall itself is a reproduction both in
  scale and design of the central hall of Caracalla’s baths, but
  improved in detail and design, having five bays instead of only three.With the two courts at each end, it makes up a suite of apartments
  very similar to those found in the Roman examples.The whole building,
  however, is less than one-fourth of the size of the central mass of a
  Roman bath, and therefore gives but little idea of the magnificence of
  the whole.Footnote 187:

  The left-hand wing of this arch has since been restored by M.
  Viollet-le-Duc, and the right-hand wing cleared of the square building
  in front of it.Footnote 188:

  These two buildings are described further on (p.544) as Christian
  edifices.Footnote 189:

  Professor Middleton states: “This building appears to be a nymphæum,
  or a part of some baths of about the time of Gallienus (263-268
  A.D.).” It was known in the Middle Ages as the “Terme de Gallucio.”
  The site of the real Temple of Minerva Medica was discovered in 1887
  (according to the same authority) between the new Via Macchiavelli and
  the Via Buonarroti, about 7 ft.Footnote 191:

  M. de Saulcy has recently attempted to prove that these tombs are
  those of the kings of Judah from David downwards.Their architecture
  is undoubtedly as late as the Christian era, and the cover of the
  sarcophagus which is now in the Louvre under the title of that of
  David is probably of the same date as these tombs, or if anything more
  modern.Footnote 192:

  Though the dates of all these tombs at Cyrene are so uncertain, there
  seems little doubt that if any one thoroughly versed in the style were
  to visit the place, he could fix the age of all of them with
  approximate correctness.The one difficulty is, that a chronometric
  scale taken from the buildings at Rome, or even in Syria, will not
  suffice.Local peculiarities must be taken into account and allowed
  for, and this requires both time and judgment.Footnote 194:

  The constructive dimensions of the porch at Chillambaram (p.History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, 1876.)are very similar to
  those of this church: both have flat stone roofs, but in the Indian,
  though a much more modern example, there is no arch.Footnote 224:

  The Renaissance dome which fits best to the church on which it is
  placed is that of Sta.Maria at Florence; but, strange to say, it is
  neither the one originally designed for the place, nor probably at all
  like it.All the others were erected as designed by the architects who
  built the churches, and none fit so well.Footnote 229:

  [The apses on each side of central apse are said to be additions to
  the original structure.The triple apses in Greek churches are found,
  according to Dr.Freshfield (‘Archæologia,’ vol.44), only in churches
  erected subsequent to Justin II.Sergius at Bosra the side apses have been added afterwards.—ED.]Footnote 230:

  cylindrical drum inserted with windows pierced in them to give more

  There are numerous examples of this class of structure in North Syria,
  but whether they are memorials or tombs is not known.See ‘Reisen
  Kleinasien und Nord Syria’ by Karl Humann and Otto Puchstein.Footnote 233:

  [This rule cannot be made a hard and fast one.Procopius states that
  in the central dome of the Church of the Apostles, Constantinople,
  “the circular building standing above the arches is pierced with
  windows, and the spherical dome which over-arches it seems to be
  suspended in the air.” In the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople
  the walls of the octagon, which are pierced with windows, are carried
  up to the vault, and in the church of Sta.Sophia at Thessalonica the
  windows are pierced in an upright dome cylindrical internally.In all
  these cases, however, there is a marked distinction between these
  examples and those of the lofty cylindrical drums which were employed
  in the Neo-Byzantine churches.Fergusson’s rule, therefore, with
  these exceptions, may be taken as absolute.—ED.]Footnote 234:

  Even if it should be asserted that this is no proof that the
  inhabitants of these countries were Buddhists in those days, it seems
  tolerably certain that they were tree-worshippers, which is very
  nearly the same thing.Procopius tells us that “even in his day these
  barbarians worshipped forests and groves, and in their barbarous
  simplicity placed the trees among their gods.” (‘De Bello Gotico,’

  The particulars and illustrations of this church are taken from a
  paper by Heinrich Keissenberger, in the ‘Jahrbuch der K. K. Commission
  für Enthaltung der Baudenkmale,’ 1860.A model of it, full size, was
  exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.Footnote 257:

  [It has been assumed that the Roman basilicas were taken possession of
  by the early Christians for their own religious services, but as Mr.G. G. Scott points out in his ‘Essay on the History of English Church
  Architecture,’ “there is no well-authenticated instance of the
  conversion of any Pagan basilica into a Christian church, whilst there
  are abundant examples of Pagan temples converted into Christian
  sanctuaries” (see Texier and Pullan’s ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ pp.Scott observes, “on the face of it
  improbable, if we reflect that the conversion of the government to
  Christianity had no tendency to render the existing basilicas less
  necessary for legal business, after the peace of the church, than they
  had been before that event.Christianity, unfortunately, could not
  abolish the litigious instincts of our nature, and after fifteen
  centuries of the gospel the legal profession still flourishes.” The
  buildings which were rendered useless by the official recognition of
  the new faith were not the basilicas but the temples, the fact being
  that the class of building known as a basilica (a term never used by
  either the writers or architects of Byzantine times), with its wide
  central nave and aisles with galleries over them lighted by clerestory
  or side windows, and covered with a timber roof, constituted the
  simplest and most economical building of large size which could be
  constructed to hold a vast assembly of worshippers; especially as the
  only features which can be looked upon as having any architectural
  pretensions, viz., the columns and their capitals, could be taken
  wholesale from temples and other Roman buildings.The semicircular
  apse, which alone in the Roman basilica served as a court of law,
  became the tribune for the bishop and presbyters.Scott is even inclined to assign an earlier and more independent
  origin for the basilican form.According to his theory the germ of the
  Christian basilica was a simple oblong aisleless room divided by a
  cross arch, beyond which lay an altar detached from the wall.This
  germ was developed by the addition of side aisles, and sometimes an
  aisle returned across the entrance, and over these upper aisles were
  next constructed and transepts added, together with the oratories or
  chapels in various parts of the building.Butler, in his work on
  ‘The Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt,’ accepts this theory, as the
  churches of Egypt are rich in evidence that favours it.At the same
  time, the first great basilica erected by Constantine, viz., the
  Vatican (St.Peter’s), and the Lateran, (St.John Lateran), are of too
  great importance to warrant the suggestion that their origin should be
  sought for in the very small though possibly earlier examples in Egypt
  or the East.—ED.]Footnote 258:

  This probably refers to its foundation, for M. Cattaneo, in his work
  ‘L’architecture en Italie, 1890,’ judging by its ornamental detail,
  places the church in the second half of the seventh century.Footnote 259:

  ‘Antiquités,’ vol.Footnote 260:

  _Eodem_, vol.Alfred J. Butler’s work, already referred to, has thrown
  considerable light on the subject, though, as he was unable to visit
  any of the Coptic churches up the Nile, we are still left in doubt as
  to the age of the convent near Siout and other buildings.From
  comparison of the plans and descriptions given in Denon, Curzon and
  Pococke of these buildings, with those in Cairo and Old Cairo, Mr.Butler ascribes them to the fourth century, that which in fact is
  claimed for them as having been founded by Sta.On this
  subject he says, p.365: “Were there no more of evidence besides to
  determine the truth of this tradition, the plan of the Haikal (the
  central of the three chapels in a Coptic church) would decide it
  beyond question.The persistence with which certain churches are
  ascribed to Sta.Helena by a people utterly ignorant of history and
  architecture is in itself remarkable, and it is still more remarkable
  to find that these churches are always marked by a particular form of
  Haikal.Indeed, so regular is the coincidence, that a deep apsidal
  haikal with recesses all round it and columns close against the wall
  may be almost infallibly dated from the age of Sta.Helena.”

Footnote 262:

  The older church has been so altered and ruined by the subsequent
  rebuildings that it is extremely difficult to make out its history.It
  seems, however, to have been built originally above the site of an old
  Mithraic temple, which has recently been cleared out, and probably
  before the time of Gregory the Great.It was apparently rebuilt, or
  nearly so, by Adrian I., 772, and burnt by Robert Guiscard, 1084.The
  upper church seems to have been erected by Paschal, 1099-1118.The
  question is, to what age do the frescoes found on the walls of the
  older church belong?Some of the heads and single figures may, I
  fancy, be anterior even to the time of Adrian; but the bulk of the
  paintings seem certainly to have been added between his age and 1084,
  and nearer the latter than the former date.If it had not been
  entirely ruined in 1084 Paschal would not have so completely
  obliterated it a century afterwards.A considerable quantity of the
  materials of the old church were used in the new, which tends further
  to confuse the chronology.Footnote 263:

  The dates here given generally refer to the building now existing or

  giving a full quotation from Eusebius of Constantine’s basilica at
  Jerusalem, in which he points out that the orientation of primitive
  times is the reverse of that which has become general in later times,
  continues his enquiry into the evidence afforded by the numerous early
  basilicas in Rome itself.Of about fifty churches of early date, in
  forty of them the sanctuary is placed at the western end, and of the
  remaining ten (one of which is the great church of St.Paolo fuori le
  Mura), there are only seven which appear to have retained their
  original form, and which have an eastward sanctuary.The exact orientation of the sanctuary in each case has been added to
  the list.—ED.]Footnote 266:

  and four other domes.Procopius speaks of the church being surrounded
  within by columns placed both above and below, probably referring to
  galleries similar to those in St.Mark’s the columns exist in one storey only, and the main wall is
  carried up at the back of the aisles to give increased size inside.Footnote 280:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The same polygonal form is found in the apses of St.Apollinare in Classe, St.Apollinare in Nuovo, St.Vitale, all in Ravenna, and St.Footnote 285:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the
  6th century church there are eight rows, so that the apse looks like a
  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  In this building they now show a sarcophagus of ancient date, said to

  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as
  the prototype of the most characteristic Lombard towers.—ED.]Footnote 305:

years past, my colleague in the commission of the Privy Seal, in old
acquaintance, very soberly and religiously inclined.Lord, what are we
without thy continual grace!Lord Falkland, grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, Secretary of State
to King Charles I., and slain in his service, died now of the smallpox.He was a pretty, brisk, understanding, industrious young gentleman; had
formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed; had also the good luck to
marry a very great fortune, besides being entitled to a vast sum, his
share of the Spanish wreck, taken up at the expense of divers
adventurers.From a Scotch Viscount he was made an English Baron,
designed Ambassador for Holland; had been Treasurer of the Navy, and
advancing extremely in the new Court.All now gone in a moment, and I
think the title is extinct.I know not whether the estate devolves to my
cousin Carew.It was at my Lord Falkland's, whose lady importuned us to
let our daughter be with her some time, so that that dear child took the
same infection, which cost her valuable life.Edwards, minister of Denton, in Sussex, a living in
my brother's gift, came to see him.Wotton, that extraordinary learned
young man, preached excellently.Duncomb, minister of Albury, preached at Wotton, a
very religious and exact discourse.The first great bank for a fund of money being now established by Act of
Parliament, was filled and completed to the sum of L120,000, and put
under the government of the most able and wealthy citizens of London.All who adventured any sum had four per cent., so long as it lay in the
bank, and had power either to take it out at pleasure, or transfer it.Glorious steady weather; corn and all fruits in extraordinary plenty

bombs, in revenge for the defeat at Brest.This manner of destructive
war was begun by the French, is exceedingly ruinous, especially falling
on the poorer people, and does not seem to tend to make a more speedy
end of the war; but rather to exasperate and incite to revenge.Many
executed at London for clipping money, now done to that intolerable
extent, that there was hardly any money that was worth above half the
nominal value.I went to visit my cousin, George Evelyn of Nutfield,
where I found a family of ten children, five sons and five
daughters--all beautiful women grown, and extremely well-fashioned.All
painted in one piece, very well, by Mr.Lutterell, in crayon on copper,
and seeming to be as finely painted as the best miniature.They are the
children of two extraordinary beautiful wives.Stormy and unseasonable wet weather this week.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th October, 1694.Paul's to see the choir, now finished
as to the stone work, and the scaffold struck both without and within,
in that part.Some exceptions might perhaps be taken as to the placing
columns on pilasters at the east tribunal.As to the rest it is a piece
of architecture without reproach.The pulling out the forms, like
drawers, from under the stalls, is ingenious.I went also to see the
building beginning near St.Giles's, where seven streets make a star
from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of a circular area; said to be
built by Mr.Neale, introducer of the late lotteries, in imitation of
those at Venice, now set up here, for himself twice, and now one for the
State.Visited the Bishop of Lincoln [Tenison] newly come
on the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who a few days before had
a paralytic stroke,--the same day and month that Archbishop Sancroft was
put out.A very sickly time, especially the smallpox, of which divers
considerable persons died.The State lottery[81] drawing, Mr.Cock, a
French refugee, and a President in the Parliament of Paris for the
Reformed, drew a lot of L1,000 per annum.[Footnote 81: State lotteries finally closed October 18, 1826.]I visited the Marquis of Normanby, and had much
discourse concerning King Charles II.Also concerning
the _quinquina_ which the physicians would not give to the King, at a
time when, in a dangerous ague, it was the only thing that could cure
him (out of envy because it had been brought into vogue by Mr.Tudor, an
apothecary), till Dr.Short, to whom the King sent to know his opinion
of it privately, he being reputed a <DW7> (but who was in truth a very
honest, good Christian), sent word to the King that it was the only
thing which could save his life, and then the King enjoined his
physicians to give it to him, which they did and he recovered.Being
asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr.Lower said it
would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last
confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.Exception was taken that
the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office
for the sick during his illness.I had news that my dear and worthy friend, Dr.Tenison, Bishop of Lincoln, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, for which
I thank God and rejoice, he being most worthy of it, for his learning,
piety, and prudence.He being my
proxy, gave my vote for Dr.The smallpox increased exceedingly, and was very
mortal.The Queen died of it on the 28th.The deaths by
smallpox increased to five hundred more than in the preceding week.The
King and Princess Anne reconciled, and she was invited to keep her Court
at Whitehall, having hitherto lived privately at Berkeley House; she was
desired to take into her family divers servants of the late Queen; to
maintain them the King has assigned her L5,000 a quarter.The frost and continual snow have now lasted five
weeks.Lord Spencer married the Duke of Newcastle's daughter,
and our neighbor, Mr.Hussey, married a daughter of my cousin, George
Evelyn, of Nutfield.The long frost intermitted, but not gone.Called to London by Lord Godolphin, one of the
Lords of the Treasury, offering me the treasurership of the hospital
designed to be built at Greenwich for worn-out seamen.The Marquis of Normanby told me King Charles had a
design to buy all King Street, and build it nobly, it being the street
leading to Westminster.This might have been done for the expense of the
Queen's funeral, which was L50,000, against her desire.Never was so universal a
mourning; all the Parliament men had cloaks given them, and four hundred
poor women; all the streets hung and the middle of the street boarded
and covered with black cloth.There were all the nobility, mayor,
aldermen, judges, etc.I supped at the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry's,
who related to me the pious behavior of the Queen in all her sickness,
which was admirable.She never inquired of what opinion persons were,
who were objects of charity; that, on opening a cabinet, a paper was
found wherein she had desired that her body might not be opened, or any
extraordinary expense at her funeral, whenever she should die.This
paper was not found in time to be observed.There were other excellent
things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were
very small, and everything in that exact method, as seldom is found in
any private person.In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for
taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo
the renowned Queen Elizabeth.I dined at the Earl of Sunderland's with Lord Spencer.My Lord showed me his library, now again improved by many books bought
at the sale of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent physician, which was
the very best collection, especially of mathematical books, that was I
believe in Europe, once designed for the King's Library at St.James's;
but the Queen dying, who was the great patroness of that design, it was
let fall, and the books were miserably dissipated.The new edition of Camden's "Britannia" was now published (by Bishop
Gibson), with great additions; those to Surrey were mine, so that I had
one presented to me.of some parts of the New
Testament in vulgar Latin, that had belonged to a monastery in the North
of Scotland, which he esteemed to be about eight hundred years old;
there were some considerable various readings observable, as in John i.,
and genealogy of St.Duncomb, parson of this parish,
preached, which he hardly comes to above once a year though but seven or
eight miles off; a florid discourse, read out of his notes.The Holy
Sacrament followed, which he administered with very little reverence,
leaving out many prayers and exhortations; nor was there any oblation.This ought to be reformed, but my good brother did not well consider
when he gave away this living and the next [Abinger].The latter end of the month sharp and severely cold, with
much snow and hard frost; no appearance of spring.Lucas preached in the afternoon at Wotton.[Sidenote: LONDON]

7th April, 1695.Lord Halifax died suddenly at London, the day his
daughter was married to the Earl of Nottingham's son at Burleigh.Lord
H. was a very rich man, very witty, and in his younger days somewhat
positive.After a most severe, cold, and snowy winter, without
almost any shower for many months, the wind continuing N. and E. and not
a leaf appearing; the weather and wind now changed, some showers fell,
and there was a remission of cold.The spring begins to appear, yet the trees hardly
leafed.Sir T. Cooke discovers what prodigious bribes have been given by
some of the East India Company out of the stock, which makes a great
clamor.Never were so many private bills passed for unsettling estates,
showing the wonderful prodigality and decay of families.I came to Deptford from Wotton, in order to the first
meeting of the Commissioners for endowing an hospital for seamen at
Greenwich; it was at the Guildhall, London.Present, the Archbishop of
Canterbury, Lord Keeper, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Godolphin, Duke of
Shrewsbury, Duke of Leeds, Earls of Dorset and Monmouth, Commissioners
of the Admiralty and Navy, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Christopher Wren, and
several more.Lowndes, Secretary to the
Lords of the Treasury, Surveyor-General.Second meeting of the Commissioners, and a committee
appointed to go to Greenwich to survey the place, I being one of them.We went to survey Greenwich, Sir Robert Clayton, Sir
Christopher Wren, Mr.Travers, the King's Surveyor, Captain Sanders, and
myself.We made report of the state of Greenwich house, and how
the standing part might be made serviceable at present for L6,000, and
what ground would be requisite for the whole design.My Lord Keeper
ordered me to prepare a book for subscriptions, and a preamble to it.Vanbrugh was made secretary to the
commission, by my nomination of him to the Lords, which was all done
that day.The commissioners met at Guildhall, when there were
scruples and contests of the Lord Mayor, who would not meet, not being
named as one of the quorum, so that a new commission was required,
though the Lord Keeper and the rest thought it too nice a punctilio.Met at Guildhall, but could do nothing for want of a
quorum.At Guildhall; account of subscriptions, about L7,000 or
L8,000.I dined at Lambeth, making my first visit to the
Archbishop, where there was much company, and great cheer.After prayers
in the evening, my Lord made me stay to show me his house, furniture,
and garden, which were all very fine, and far beyond the usual
Archbishops, not as affected by this, but being bought ready furnished
by his predecessor.We discoursed of several public matters,
particularly of the Princess of Denmark, who made so little figure.Met at Guildhall; not a full committee, so nothing
done.No sermon at church; but, after prayers, the names of
all the parishioners were read, in order to gathering the tax of 4s.for
marriages, burials, etc.A very imprudent tax, especially this reading
the names, so that most went out of the church.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

19th July, 1695.I dined at Sir Purbeck Temple's, near Croydon; his lady
is aunt to my son-in-law, Draper; the house exactly furnished.Went
thence with my son and daughter to Wotton.Duncomb,
parson of Albury, preached excellently.The weather now so cold, that greater frosts were not
always seen in the midst of winter; this succeeded much wet, and set
harvest extremely back.Offley preached at Abinger; too much
controversy on a point of no consequence, for the country people here.This was the first time I had heard him preach.Bombarding of Cadiz; a
cruel and brutish way of making war, first began by the French.The
season wet, great storms, unseasonable harvest weather.My good and
worthy friend, Captain Gifford, who that he might get some competence to
live decently, adventured all he had in a voyage of two years to the
East Indies, was, with another great ship, taken by some French
men-of-war, almost within sight of England, to the loss of near L70,000,
to my great sorrow, and pity of his wife, he being also a valiant and
industrious man.The losses of this sort to the nation have been
immense, and all through negligence, and little care to secure the same
near our own coasts; of infinitely more concern to the public than
spending their time in bombarding and ruining two or three paltry towns,
without any benefit, or weakening our enemies, who, though they began,
ought not to be imitated in an action totally averse to humanity, or
Christianity.Sir Purbeck Temple, uncle to my
son Draper, died suddenly.His lady being
own aunt to my son Draper, he hopes for a good fortune, there being no
heir.There had been a new meeting of the commissioners about Greenwich
hospital, on the new commission, where the Lord Mayor, etc.appeared,
but I was prevented by indisposition from attending.The weather very
sharp, winter approaching apace.The King went a progress into the
north, to show himself to the people against the elections, and was
everywhere complimented, except at Oxford, where it was not as he
expected, so that he hardly stopped an hour there, and having seen the
theater, did not receive the banquet proposed.Paul's school, who showed me many curious passages out of some
ancient Platonists' MSS.concerning the Trinity, which this great and
learned person would publish, with many other rare things, if he was
encouraged, and eased of the burden of teaching.The Archbishop and myself went to Hammersmith, to
visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a very mortifying
sight.He showed us his invention of writing, which was very ingenious;
also his wooden calendar, which instructed him all by feeling; and other
pretty and useful inventions of mills, pumps, etc., and the pump he had
erected that serves water to his garden, and to passengers, with an
inscription, and brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most
perfect and pure water.He had newly buried L200 worth of music books
six feet under ground, being, as he said, love songs and vanity.He
plays himself psalms and religious hymns on the theorbo.[Sidenote: LONDON]

10th November, 1695.Stanhope, Vicar of Lewisham, preached at
Whitehall.He is one of the most accomplished preachers I ever heard,
for matter, eloquence, action, voice, and I am told, of excellent
conversation.Famous fireworks and very chargeable, the King
being returned from his progress.He stayed seven or eight days at Lord
Sunderland's at Althorpe, where he was mightily entertained.These
fireworks were shown before Lord Romney, master of the ordnance, in St.James's great square, where the King stood.I spoke to the Archbishop of Canterbury to interest
himself for restoring a room belonging to St.James's library, where the
books want place.Williams continued in Boyle's
lectures another year.I dined at Lord Sunderland's, now the great favorite
and underhand politician, but not adventuring on any character, being
obnoxious to the people for having twice changed his religion.The Parliament wondrously intent on ways to reform
the coin; setting out a Proclamation prohibiting the currency of
half-crowns, etc., which made much confusion among the people.Hitherto mild, dark, misty, weather.Great confusion and distraction by reason of the
clipped money, and the difficulty found in reforming it.An extraordinary wet season, though temperate as to
cold.The "Royal Sovereign" man-of-war burned at Chatham.It was built
in 1637, and having given occasion to the levy of ship money was perhaps
the cause of all the after troubles to this day.An earthquake in
Dorsetshire by Portland, or rather a sinking of the ground suddenly for
a large space, near the quarries of stone, hindering the conveyance of
that material for the finishing St.There was now a conspiracy of about thirty
knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English <DW7>s,
and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the
first opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or
to the chapel; and upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to
Calais, an invasion was designed.In order to it there was a great army
in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection
here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them,
King James attending at Calais with the French army.It was discovered
by some of their own party.L1,000 reward was offered to whoever could
apprehend any of the thirty named.Most of those who were engaged in it,
were taken and secured.The Parliament, city, and all the nation,
congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that,
if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on
the <DW7>s and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing
up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown
should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the
Revolution.All <DW7>s, in the meantime, to be banished ten miles from
London.This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general
animosity against the French King and King James.The militia of the
nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and
all things put in a posture to encounter a descent.This was so timed by
the enemy, that while we were already much discontented by the greatness
of the taxes, and corruption of the money, etc., we had like to have had
very few men-of-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral
Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron,
with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel,
and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could
be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken.I look
on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of
God.Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design
of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many oL his
friends, and was likely to produce a more perfect establishment of King
William.The wind continuing N. and E. all this week, brought so
many of our men-of-war together that, though most of the French finding
their design detected and prevented, made a shift to get into Calais and
Dunkirk roads, we wanting fire-ships and bombs to disturb them; yet they
were so engaged among the sands and flats, that 'tis said they cut their
masts and flung their great guns overboard to lighten their vessels.French were to
have invaded at once England, Scotland, and Ireland.Divers of the conspirators tried and condemned.Vesuvius breaking out, terrified Naples.Three of the unhappy wretches,
whereof one was a priest, were executed[82] for intending to assassinate
the King; they acknowledged their intention, but acquitted King James of
inciting them to it, and died very penitent.Divers more in danger, and
some very considerable persons.[Footnote 82: Robert Charnock, Edward King, and Thomas Keys.][Sidenote: LONDON]

6th April, 1696.The quarters of Sir William Perkins and Sir John
Friend, lately executed on the plot, with Perkins's head, were set up at
Temple Bar, a dismal sight, which many pitied.I think there never was
such at Temple Bar till now, except once in the time of King Charles
II., namely, of Sir Thomas Armstrong.[83]

    [Footnote 83: He was concerned in the Rye-House plot, fled into
    Holland, was given up, and executed in his own country, 1684.Great offense taken at the three ministers who
absolved Sir William Perkins and Friend at Tyburn.One of them (Snatt)
was a son of my old schoolmaster.This produced much altercation as to
the canonicalness of the action.We had a meeting at Guildhall of the grand committee
about settling the draught of Greenwich hospital.I went to Eton, and dined with Dr.The schoolmaster assured me there had not been for twenty years
a more pregnant youth in that place than my grandson.I went to see the
King's House at Kensington.The
gallery furnished with the best pictures [from] all the houses, of
Titian, Raphael, Correggio, Holbein, Julio Romano, Bassan, Vandyke,
Tintoretto, and others; a great collection of porcelain; and a pretty
private library.His prayer before
the sermon was one of the most excellent compositions I ever heard.The Venetian Ambassador made a stately entry with
fifty footmen, many on horseback, four rich coaches, and a numerous
train of gallants.Oates
dedicated a most villainous, reviling book against King James, which he
presumed to present to King William, who could not but abhor it,
speaking so infamously and untruly of his late beloved Queen's own
father.I dined at Lambeth, being summoned to meet my co-trustees,
the Archbishop, Sir Henry Ashurst, and Mr.Serjeant Rotheram, to consult
about settling Mr.Boyle's lecture for a perpetuity; which we concluded
upon, by buying a rent charge of L50 per annum, with the stock in our
hands.I went to Lambeth, to meet at dinner the Countess of
Sunderland and divers ladies.We dined in the Archbishop's wife's
apartment with his Grace, and stayed late; yet I returned to Deptford at
night.I went to London to meet my son, newly come from
Ireland, indisposed.Money still continuing exceedingly scarce, so that
none was paid or received, but all was on trust, the mint not supplying
for common necessities.The Association with an oath required of all
lawyers and officers, on pain of _praemunire_, whereby men were obliged
to renounce King James as no rightful king, and to revenge King
William's death, if happening by assassination.This to be taken by all
the Counsel by a day limited, so that the Courts of Chancery and King's
Bench hardly heard any cause in Easter Term, so many crowded to take the
oath.This was censured as a very entangling contrivance of the
Parliament in expectation, that many in high office would lay down, and
others surrender.Many gentlemen taken up on suspicion of the late plot,
were now discharged out of prison.We settled divers offices, and other matters relating to
workmen, for the beginning of Greenwich hospital.[Sidenote: DEPTFORD]

1st June, 1696.I went to Deptford to dispose of our goods, in order to
letting the house for three years to Vice Admiral Benbow, with condition
to keep up the garden.A committee met at Whitehall about Greenwich Hospital,
at Sir Christopher Wren's, his Majesty's Surveyor-General.We made the
first agreement with divers workmen and for materials; and gave the
first order for proceeding on the foundation, and for weekly payments to
the workmen, and a general account to be monthly.Dined at Lord Pembroke's, Lord Privy Seal, a very
worthy gentleman.He showed me divers rare pictures of very many of the
old and best masters, especially one of M. Angelo of a man gathering
fruit to give to a woman, and a large book of the best drawings of the
old masters.Sir John Fenwick, one of the conspirators, was taken.Great
subscriptions in Scotland to their East India Company.Want of current
money to carry on the smallest concerns, even for daily provisions in
the markets.Guineas lowered to twenty-two shillings, and great sums
daily transported to Holland, where it yields more, with other treasure
sent to pay the armies, and nothing considerable coined of the new and
now only current stamp, cause such a scarcity that tumults are every day
feared, nobody paying or receiving money; so imprudent was the late
Parliament to condemn the old though clipped and corrupted, till they
had provided supplies.To this add the fraud of the bankers and
goldsmiths, who having gotten immense riches by extortion, keep up their
treasure in expectation of enhancing its value.Duncombe, not long since
a mean goldsmith, having made a purchase of the late Duke of
Buckingham's estate at nearly L90,000, and reputed to have nearly as
much in cash.Banks and lotteries every day set up.The famous trial between my Lord Bath and Lord Montague
for an estate of L11,000 a year, left by the Duke of Albemarle, wherein
on several trials had been spent,L20,000 between them.The Earl of Bath
was cast on evident forgery.I made my Lord Cheney a visit at Chelsea, and saw those
ingenious waterworks invented by Mr.Winstanley, wherein were some
things very surprising and extraordinary.An exceedingly rainy, cold, unseasonable summer, yet
the city was very healthy.A trial in the Common Pleas between the Lady Purbeck
Temple and Mr.Temple, a nephew of Sir Purbeck, concerning a deed set up
to take place of several wills.The
cause went on my lady's side.This concerning my son-in-law, Draper, I
stayed almost all day at Court.A great supper was given to the jury,
being persons of the best condition in Buckinghamshire.I went with a select committee of the Commissioners for
Greenwich Hospital, and with Sir Christopher Wren, where with him I laid
the first stone of the intended foundation, precisely at five o'clock in
the evening, after we had dined together.Flamstead, the King's
Astronomical Professor, observing the punctual time by instruments.Note that my Lord Godolphin was the first of the
subscribers who paid any money to this noble fabric.A northern wind altering the weather with a continual
and impetuous rain of three days and nights changed it into perfect
winter.So little money in the nation that Exchequer Tallies,
of which I had for L2,000 on the best fund in England, the Post Office,
nobody would take at 30 per cent discount.The Bank lending the L200,000 to pay the array in
Flanders, that had done nothing against the enemy, had so exhausted the
treasure of the nation, that one could not have borrowed money under 14
or 15 per cent on bills, or on Exchequer Tallies under 30 per cent.I went to Lambeth and dined with the
Archbishop, who had been at Court on the complaint against Dr.David's, who was suspended for simony.The
Archbishop told me how unsatisfied he was with the Canon law, and how
exceedingly unreasonable all their pleadings appeared to him.Fine seasonable weather, and a great harvest after a
cold, wet summer.I went to congratulate the marriage of a daughter
of Mr.Boscawen to the son of Sir Philip Meadows; she is niece to my
Lord Godolphin, married at Lambeth by the Archbishop, 30th of August.After above six months' stay in London about Greenwich Hospital, I
returned to Wotton.Unseasonable stormy weather, and an ill seedtime.Lord Godolphin retired from the Treasury, who was the
first Commissioner and most skillful manager of all.The first frost began fiercely, but lasted not long.15th-23d November, 1696.Very stormy weather, rain, and inundations.The severe frost and weather relented, but again
froze with snow.Sir John
Fenwick was beheaded.Soldiers in the
armies and garrison towns frozen to death on their posts.I came to Wotton after three months' absence.Very bright weather, but with sharp east wind.My son
came from London in his melancholy indisposition.Duncombe, the rector, came and preached after
an absence of two years, though only living seven or eight miles off [at
Ashted].So great were the storms all this week, that near a
thousand people were lost going into the Texel.[Sidenote: LONDON]

16th November, 1697.The King's entry very pompous; but is nothing
approaching that of King Charles II.Thanksgiving Day for the Peace, the King and a great
Court at Whitehall.The Bishop of Salisbury preached, or rather made a
florid panegyric, on 2 Chron.The evening concluded with
fireworks and illuminations of great expense.Paul's had had service
performed in it since it was burned in 1666.I went to Kensington with the Sheriff, Knights, and
chief gentlemen of Surrey, to present their address to the King.The
Duke of Norfolk promised to introduce it, but came so late, that it was
presented before be came.This insignificant ceremony was brought in in
Cromwell's time, and has ever since continued with offers of life and
fortune to whoever happened to have the power.I dined at Sir Richard
Onslow's, who treated almost all the gentlemen of Surrey.When we had
half dined, the Duke of Norfolk came in to make his excuse.At the Temple Church; it was very long before the
service began, staying for the Comptroller of the Inner Temple, where
was to be kept a riotous and reveling Christmas, according to custom.Bentley, about the Library at
St.A great Christmas kept at Wotton, open house, much company.I
presented my book of Medals, etc., to divers noblemen, before I exposed
it to sale.Fulham, who lately married my niece, preached
against atheism, a very eloquent discourse, somewhat improper for most
of the audience at [Wotton], but fitted for some other place, and very
apposite to the profane temper of the age.[Sidenote: LONDON]

5th January, 1698.Whitehall burned, nothing but walls and ruins left.The imprisonment of the great banker, Duncombe:
censured by Parliament; acquitted by the Lords; sent again to the Tower
by the Commons.The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the
building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court
and palace, newly furnished for him by the King.[84]

    [Footnote 84: While the Czar was in his house.Evelyn's servant
    writes to him: "There is a house full of people, and right nasty.The Czar lies next your library, and dines in the parlor next your
    study.He dines at ten o'clock and at six at night; is very seldom
    at home a whole day; very often in the King's yard, or by water,
    dressed in several dresses.The King is expected here this day; the
    best parlor is pretty clean for him to be entertained in.The King
    pays for all he has."]The Czar went from my house to return home.An
exceedingly sharp and cold season.An extraordinary great snow and frost, nipping the corn
and other fruits.Corn at nine shillings a bushel [L18 a load].Pepys's, where I heard the rare voice of
Mr.Pule, who was lately come from Italy, reputed the most excellent
singer we had ever had.White, late Bishop of Norwich, who had been ejected
for not complying with Government, was buried in St.Gregory's
churchyard, or vault, at St.His hearse was accompanied by two
non-juror bishops, Dr.Lloyd, with forty other
non-juror clergymen, who would not stay the Office of the burial,
because the Dean of St.Paul's had appointed a conforming minister to
read the Office; at which all much wondered, there being nothing in that
Office which mentioned the present King.Godolphin
with the Earl of Marlborough's daughter.To Deptford, to see how miserably the Czar had left my
house, after three months making it his Court.I got Sir Christopher
Wren, the King's surveyor, and Mr.London, his gardener, to go and
estimate the repairs, for which they allowed L150 in their report to the
Lords of the Treasury.I then went to see the foundation of the Hall and
Chapel at Greenwich Hospital.I dined with Pepys, where was Captain Dampier,[85] who
had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted Prince Job,
and printed a relation of his very strange adventure, and his
observations.He was now going abroad again by the King's encouragement,
who furnished a ship of 290 tons.He seemed a more modest man than one
would imagine by the relation of the crew he had assorted with.He
brought a map of his observations of the course of the winds in the
South Sea, and assured us that the maps hitherto extant were all false
as to the Pacific Sea, which he makes on the south of the line, that on
the north end running by the coast of Peru being extremely tempestuous.[Footnote 85: The celebrated navigator, born in 1652, the time of
    whose death is uncertain.His "Voyage Round the World" has gone
    through many editions, and the substance of it has been transferred
    to many collections of voyages.]Foy came to me to use my interest with Lord
Sunderland for his being made Professor of Physic at Oxford, in the
King's gift.I went also to the Archbishop in his behalf.Being one of the Council of the Royal Society, I was
named to be of the committee to wait on our new President, the Lord
Chancellor, our Secretary, Dr.Sloane, and Sir R. Southwell, last
Vice-President, carrying our book of statutes; the office of the
President being read, his Lordship subscribed his name, and took the
oaths according to our statutes as a Corporation for the improvement of
natural knowledge.Then his Lordship made a short compliment concerning
the honor the Society had done him, and how ready he would be to promote
so noble a design, and come himself among us, as often as the attendance
on the public would permit; and so we took our leave.She was daughter to Sir
John Evelyn, of Wilts, my father's nephew; she was widow to William
Pierrepoint, brother to the Marquis of Dorchester, and mother to Evelyn
Pierrepoint, Earl of Kingston; a most excellent and prudent lady.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The House of Commons persist in refusing more than 7,000 men to be a
standing army, and no strangers to be in the number.Our county member, Sir R. Onslow, opposed it also; which
might reconcile him to the people, who began to suspect him.Mander, the
Master of Baliol College, where he was entered a fellow-commoner.A most furious wind, such as has not happened for
many years, doing great damage to houses and trees, by the fall of which
several persons were killed.The old East India Company lost their business against
the new Company, by ten votes in Parliament, so many of their friends
being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.The persecuted Vaudois, who were banished out of Savoy, were received by
the German Protestant Princes.My only remaining son died after a tedious languishing
sickness, contracted in Ireland, and increased here, to my exceeding
grief and affliction; leaving me one grandson, now at Oxford, whom I
pray God to prosper and be the support of the Wotton family.He was aged
forty-four years and about three months.He had been six years one of
the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland, with great ability and
reputation.After an extraordinary storm, there came up the Thames
a whale which was fifty-six feet long.Such, and a larger of the spout
kind, was killed there forty years ago (June 1658).My deceased son was buried in the vault at Wotton,
according to his desire.The Duke of Devon lost L1,900 at a horse race at Newmarket.The King preferring his young favorite Earl of Albemarle to be first
Commander of his Guard, the Duke of Ormond laid down his commission.This of the Dutch Lord passing over his head, was exceedingly resented
by everybody.Lord Spencer purchased an incomparable library[86] of...
wherein, among other rare books, were several that were printed at the
first invention of that wonderful art, as particularly "Tully's Offices,
etc."There was a Homer and a Suidas in a very good Greek character and
good paper, almost as ancient.This gentleman is a very fine scholar,
whom from a child I have known.[Footnote 86: The foundation of the noble library now at Blenheim.]I dined with the Archbishop; but my business was to
get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop of Worcester's
library, and build a place for his own library at St.James's, in the
Park, the present one being too small.At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be of
the committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to
purchase the Bishop of Worcester's library (Dr.The Court party have little influence in this Session.The Duke of Ormond restored to his commission.All
Lotteries, till now cheating the people, to be no longer permitted than
to Christmas, except that for the benefit of Greenwich Hospital.Bridgman, chairman of the committee for that charitable work, died; a
great loss to it.He was Clerk of the Council, a very industrious,
useful man.John Moore,[87] Bishop of Norwich,
one of the best and most ample collection of all sorts of good books in
England, and he, one of the most learned men.[Footnote 87: Afterward Bishop of Ely.He died 31st of July, 1714.King George I. purchased this library after the Bishop's death, for
    L6,000, and presented it to the University of Cambridge, where it
    now is.]After a long drought, we had a refreshing shower.The
day before, there was a dreadful fire at Rotherhithe, near the Thames
side, which burned divers ships, and consumed nearly three hundred
houses.Now died the famous Duchess of Mazarin; she had been the richest
lady in Europe.She was niece of Cardinal Mazarin, and was married to
the richest subject in Europe, as is said.She was born at Rome,
educated in France, and was an extraordinary beauty and wit but
dissolute and impatient of matrimonial restraint, so as to be abandoned
by her husband, and banished, when she came into England for shelter,
lived on a pension given her here, and is reported to have hastened her
death by intemperate drinking strong spirits.She has written her own
story and adventures, and so has her other extravagant sister, wife to
the noble family of Colonna.[Sidenote: LONDON]

15th June, 1699.This week died Conyers Seymour, son of Sir Edward
Seymour, killed in a duel caused by a slight affront in St.James's
Park, given him by one who was envious of his gallantries; for he was a
vain, foppish young man, who made a great _eclat_ about town by his
splendid equipage and boundless expense.He was about twenty-three years
old; his brother, now at Oxford, inherited an estate of L7,000 a year,
which had fallen to him not two years before.My cousin, George Evelyn, of Nutfield, died suddenly.The heat has been so great, almost all this month, that
I do not remember to have felt much greater in Italy, and this after a
winter the wettest, though not the coldest, that I remember for fifty
years last past.Finding my occasions called me so often to London, I
took the remainder of the lease my son had in a house in Dover Street,
to which I now removed, not taking my goods from Wotton.Seasonable showers, after a continuance of excessive
drought and heat.At Deptford, they had
been building a pretty new church.David's [Watson]
deprived for simony.[88] The city of Moscow burnt by the throwing of
squibs.[Footnote 88: _Ante_, p.There was in this week an eclipse of the sun, at
which many were frightened by the predictions of the astrologers.I
remember fifty years ago that many were so terrified by Lilly, that they
dared not go out of their houses.A strange earthquake at New Batavia,
in the East Indies.My worthy brother died at Wotton, in the 83d year of
his age, of perfect memory and understanding.He was religious, sober,
and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the
county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house
the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free
entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was
never free.There were sometimes twenty persons more than his family,
and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by
this he gained the universal love of the county.He was born at Wotton,
went from the free school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford,
thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but
without intention to study the law as a profession.He married the
daughter of Colwall, of a worthy and ancient family in Leicestershire,
by whom he had one son; she dying in 1643, left George her son an
infant, who being educated liberally, after traveling abroad, returned
and married one Mrs.Gore, by whom he had several children, but only
three daughters survived.He was a young man of good understanding, but,
over-indulging his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary
to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.My brother afterward married a noble and honorable lady, relict of Sir
John Cotton, she being an Offley, a worthy and ancient Staffordshire
family, by whom he had several children of both sexes.This lady died,
leaving only two daughters and a son.The younger daughter died before
marriage; the other afterward married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and
learned gentleman (son of Sir ---- Wych), who had been Ambassador at
Constantinople, and was afterward made one of the Lords Justices of
Ireland.Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of
---- Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honorable family, but left a widow
without any child living; he died about 1691, and his wife not many
years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.His
sister, Wych, had a portion of L6,000, to which was added L300 more; the
three other daughters, with what I added, had about L5,000 each.My
brother died on the 5th of October, in a good old age and great
reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix,
leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, etc.She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than
as a private gentleman.There were, as I computed, above 2,000 persons
at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last
honors.I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and
family.After an unusual warm and pleasant season, we were
surprised with a very sharp frost.I presented my "_Acetaria_,"
dedicated to my Lord Chancellor, who returned me thanks in an
extraordinarily civil letter.There happened this week so thick a mist and fog,
that people lost their way in the streets, it being so intense that no
light of candles, or torches, yielded any (or but very little)
direction.Robberies were committed between
the very lights which were fixed between London and Kensington on both
sides, and while coaches and travelers were passing.It began about four
in the afternoon, and was quite gone by eight, without any wind to
disperse it.At the Thames, they beat drums to direct the watermen to
make the shore.At our chapel in the evening there was a sermon
preached by young Mr.Horneck, chaplain to Lord Guilford, whose lady's
funeral had been celebrated magnificently the Thursday before.A
panegyric was now pronounced, describing the extraordinary piety and
excellently employed life of this amiable young lady.She died in
childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who
ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life,
exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his
life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the
mode of this dissolute age.Her devotion, early piety, charity,
fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying,
recollections in her own handwriting of what she heard and read, and her
conversation were most exemplary.Blackwell's election to be the next
year's Boyles Lecturer.Such horrible robberies and murders were committed, as had not been
known in this nation; atheism, profaneness, blasphemy, among all sorts,
portended some judgment if not amended; on which a society was set on
foot, who obliged themselves to endeavor the reforming of it, in London
and other places, and began to punish offenders and put the laws in more
strict execution; which God Almighty prosper!A gentle, calm, dry,
temperate weather all this season of the year, but now came sharp, hard
frost, and mist, but calm.Calm, bright, and warm as in the middle of April.So
continued on 21st of January.[Sidenote: LONDON]

The Parliament reverses the prodigious donations of the Irish
forfeitures, which were intended to be set apart for discharging the
vast national debt.They called some great persons in the highest
offices in question for setting the Great Seal to the pardon of an
arch-pirate,[89] who had turned pirate again, and brought prizes into
the West Indies, suspected to be connived at on sharing the prey; but
the prevailing part in the House called Courtiers, out-voted the
complaints, not by being more in number, but by the country party being
negligent in attendance.[Footnote 89: Captain Kidd; he was hanged about two years afterward
    with some of his accomplices.This was one of the charges brought by
    the Commons against Lord Somers.]14th January, 1699-1700.Stringfellow, who had been made the first preacher at our chapel by
the Bishop of Lincoln [Dr.Tenison, now Archbishop], while he held St.Martin's by dispensation, and put in one Mr.Sandys, much against the
inclination of those who frequented the chapel.The Scotch book about
Darien was burned by the hangman by vote of Parliament.[90]

    [Footnote 90: The volume alluded to was "An Enquiry into the Causes
    of the Miscarriage of the Scots Colony at Darien: Or an Answer to a
    Libel," entitled "A Defense of the Scots abdicating Darien."See
    Votes of the House of Commons, 15th January, 1699-1700.]Died the Duke of Beaufort, a person of great honor,
prudence, and estate.I went to Wotton, the first time after my brother's
funeral, to furnish the house with necessaries, Lady Wych and my nephew
Glanville, the executors having sold and disposed of what goods were
there of my brother's.The weather was now altering into sharp and hard
frost.[Sidenote: LONDON]

One Stephens, who preached before the House of Commons on King Charles's
Martyrdom, told them that the observation of that day was not intended
out of any detestation of his murder, but to be a lesson to other Kings
and Rulers, how they ought to behave themselves toward their subjects,
lest they should come to the same end.This was so resented that, though
it was usual to desire these anniversary sermons to be printed, they
refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no one should preach
before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.The Parliament voted against the Scots settling in
Darien as being prejudicial to our trade with Spain.They also voted
that the exorbitant number of attorneys be lessened (now indeed
swarming, and evidently causing lawsuits and disturbance, eating out the
estates of the people, provoking them to go to law).Mild and calm season, with gentle frost, and little
mizzling rain.Martin's frequently preached at Trinity
chapel in the afternoon.The season was like April for warmth and
mildness.--11th.On Wednesday, was a sermon at our chapel, to be
continued during Lent.I was at the funeral of my Lady Temple, who was buried
at Islington, brought from Addiscombe, near Croydon.She left my
son-in-law Draper (her nephew) the mansion house of Addiscombe, very
nobly and completely furnished, with the estate about it, with plate and
jewels, to the value in all of about L20,000.She was a very prudent
lady, gave many great legacies, with L500 to the poor of Islington,
where her husband, Sir Purbeck Temple, was buried, both dying without
issue.The season warm, gentle, and exceedingly pleasant.Divers persons of quality entered into the Society for Reformation[91]
of Manners; and some lectures were set up, particularly in the city of
London.The most eminent of the clergy preached at Bow Church, after
reading a declaration set forth by the King to suppress the growing
wickedness; this began already to take some effect as to common
swearing, and oaths in the mouths of people of all ranks.[Footnote 91: _Ante_, p.Burnet preached to-day before the Lord Mayor and a
very great congregation, on Proverbs xxvii.5, 6, "Open rebuke is better
than secret love; the wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of
an enemy."He made a very pathetic discourse concerning the necessity
and advantage of friendly correction.The Duke of Norfolk now succeeded in obtaining a divorce
from his wife by the Parliament for adultery with Sir John Germaine, a
Dutch gamester, of mean extraction, who had got much by gaming; the Duke
had leave to marry again, so that if he should have children, the
Dukedom will go from the late Lord Thomas's children, <DW7>s indeed,
but very hopeful and virtuous gentlemen, as was their father.The now
Duke their uncle is a Protestant.The Parliament nominated fourteen persons to go into Ireland as
commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, toward payment
of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great
measure given to some of his favorites of both sexes, Dutch and others
of little merit, and very unseasonably.That this might be done without
suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member
of either House should be in the commission.The great contest between
the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and
rejecting bills tacked to the money bill, carried for the Commons.However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King
Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass
rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance.This was
carried but by one voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the
Court, save one; so that near sixty bills passed, to the great triumph
of the Commons and Country party, but high regret of the Court, and
those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland.Pity it is,
that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this
nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are
satisfied with nothing; and, while there is no perfection on this side
heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too
far.Among the rest, there passed a law as to <DW7>s' estates, that if
one turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass
to his next Protestant heir.This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only
the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the
indiscreet insolence of the <DW7>s here, going in triumphant and public
processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers
places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their
party.This week there was a great change of State officers.The Duke of Shrewsbury resigned his Lord Chamberlainship to the Earl of
Jersey, the Duke's indisposition requiring his retreat.Vernon,
Secretary of State, was put out.The Seal was taken from the Lord
Chancellor Somers, though he had been acquitted by a great majority of
votes for what was charged against him in the House of Commons.This
being in term time, put some stop to business, many eminent lawyers
refusing to accept the office, considering the uncertainty of things in
this fluctuating conjuncture.It is certain that this Chancellor was a
most excellent lawyer, very learned in all polite literature, a superior
pen, master of a handsome style, and of easy conversation; but he is
said to make too much haste to be rich, as his predecessor, and most in
place in this age did, to a more prodigious excess than was ever known.But the Commons had now so mortified the Court party, and property and
liberty were so much invaded in all the neighboring kingdoms, that their
jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which
protected the people from tyranny.A most glorious spring, with hope of abundance of fruit of all kinds,
and a propitious year.The great trial between Sir Walter Clarges and Mr.Sherwin concerning the legitimacy of the late Duke of Albemarle, on
which depended an estate of L1,500 a year; the verdict was given for Sir
Walter, 19th.Serjeant Wright at last accepted the Great Seal.[Sidenote: WOTTON]

24th May, 1700.I went from Dover street to Wotton, for the rest of the
summer, and removed thither the rest of my goods from Sayes Court.A sweet season, with a mixture of refreshing showers.In the afternoon, our clergyman had a catechism,
which was continued for some time.I was visited with illness, but it pleased God that I
recovered, for which praise be ascribed to him by me, and that he has
again so graciously advertised me of my duty to prepare for my latter
end, which at my great age, cannot be far off.The Duke of Gloucester, son of the Princess Anne of Denmark, died of the
smallpox.I went to Harden, which was originally a barren warren
bought by Sir Robert Clayton, who built there a pretty house, and made
such alteration by planting not only an infinite store of the best
fruit; but so changed the natural situation of the hill, valleys, and
solitary mountains about it, that it rather represented some foreign
country, which would produce spontaneously pines, firs, cypress, yew,
holly, and juniper; they were come to their perfect growth, with walks,
mazes, etc., among them, and were preserved with the utmost care, so
that I who had seen it some years before in its naked and barren
condition, was in admiration of it.The land was bought of Sir John
Evelyn, of Godstone, and was thus improved for pleasure and retirement
by the vast charge and industry of this opulent citizen.He and his lady
received us with great civility.The tombs in the church at Croydon of
Archbishops Grindal, Whitgift, and other Archbishops, are fine and
venerable; but none comparable to that of the late Archbishop Sheldon,
which, being all of white marble, and of a stately ordinance and
carvings, far surpassed the rest, and I judge could not cost less than
L700 or L800.I went to Beddington, the ancient seat of the
Carews, in my remembrance a noble old structure, capacious, and in form
of the buildings of the age of Henry VIII.and Queen Elizabeth, and
proper for the old English hospitality, but now decaying with the house
itself, heretofore adorned with ample gardens, and the first orange
trees[92] that had been seen in England, planted in the open ground, and
secured in winter only by a tabernacle of boards and stoves removable in
summer, that, standing 120 years, large and goodly trees, and laden with
fruit, were now in decay, as well as the grotto, fountains, cabinets,
and other curiosities in the house and abroad, it being now fallen to a
child under age, and only kept by a servant or two from utter
dilapidation.The estate and park about it also in decay.[Footnote 92: Oranges were eaten in this kingdom much earlier than
    the time of King James I.]Pepys at Clapham, where he has
a very noble and wonderfully well-furnished house, especially with
Indian and Chinese curiosities.The offices and gardens well
accommodated for pleasure and retirement.My birthday now completed the 80th year of my age.I
with my soul render thanks to God, who, of his infinite mercy, not only
brought me out of many troubles, but this year restored me to health,
after an ague and other infirmities of so great an age; my sight,
hearing, and other senses and faculties tolerable, which I implore him
to continue, with the pardon of my sins past, and grace to acknowledge
by my improvement of his goodness the ensuing year, if it be his
pleasure to protract my life, that I may be the better prepared for my
last day, through the infinite merits of my blessed Savior, the Lord
Jesus, Amen!Came the news of my dear grandson (the only male of
my family now remaining) being fallen ill of the smallpox at Oxford,
which after the dire effects of it in my family exceedingly afflicted
me; but so it pleased my most merciful God that being let blood at his
first complaint, and by the extraordinary care of Dr.Mander (Head of
the college and now Vice Chancellor), who caused him to be brought and
lodged in his own bed and bedchamber, with the advice of his physician
and care of his tutor, there were all fair hopes of his recovery, to our
infinite comfort.We had a letter every day either from the Vice
Chancellor himself, or his tutor.Assurance of his recovery by a letter from himself.[Sidenote: LONDON]

There was a change of great officers at Court.Lord Godolphin returned
to his former station of first Commissioner of the Treasury; Sir Charles
Hedges, Secretary of State.At the Royal Society, Lord Somers, the late
Chancellor, was continued President.Great alterations of officers at Court, and
elsewhere,--Lord Chief Justice Treby died; he was a learned man in his
profession, of which we have now few, never fewer; the Chancery
requiring so little skill in deep law-learning, if the practicer can
talk eloquently in that Court; so that probably few care to study the
law to any purpose.Lord Marlborough Master of the Ordnance, in place of
Lord Romney made Groom of the Stole.The Earl of Rochester goes Lord
Lieutenant to Ireland.I finished the sale of North Stoake in Sussex to
Robert Michell, Esq., appointed by my brother to be sold for payment of
portions to my nieces, and other incumbrances on the estate.An exceeding deep snow, and melted away as suddenly.Severe frost, and such a tempest as threw down many
chimneys, and did great spoil at sea, and blew down above twenty trees
of mine at Wotton.Harley, an able
gentleman, chosen.Our countryman, Sir Richard Onslow, had a party for
him.By an order of the House of Commons, I laid before
the Speaker the state of what had been received and paid toward the
building of Greenwich Hospital.Wye, Rector of Wotton, died, a very worthy good man.Bohun, a learned person and excellent preacher, who had been my
son's tutor, and lived long in my family.I let Sayes Court to Lord Carmarthen, son to the Duke
of Leeds.I went to the funeral of my sister Draper, who was
buried at Edmonton in great state.Davenant displeased the clergy
now met in Convocation by a passage in his book, p.A Dutch boy of about eight or nine years old was carried
about by his parents to show, who had about the iris of one eye the
letters of _Deus meus_, and of the other _Elohim_, in the Hebrew
character.How this was done by artifice none could imagine; his parents
affirming that he was so born.It did not prejudice his sight, and he
seemed to be a lively playing boy.Everybody went to see him; physicians
and philosophers examined it with great accuracy; some considered it as
artificial, others as almost supernatural.The Duke of Norfolk died of an apoplexy, and Mr.Thomas
Howard of complicated disease since his being cut for the stone; he was
one of the Tellers of the Exchequer.Some Kentish men, delivering a petition to the House of
Commons, were imprisoned.[93]

    [Footnote 93: Justinian Champneys, Thomas Culpepper, William
    Culpepper, William Hamilton, and David Polhill, gentlemen of
    considerable property and family in the county.There is a very good
    print of them in five ovals on one plate, engraved by R. White, in
    1701.They desired the Parliament to mind the public more, and their
    private heats less.They were confined till the prorogation, and
    were much visited.A great dearth, no considerable rain having fallen for some months.Very plentiful showers, the wind coming west and south.The Bishops and Convocation at difference concerning the right of

20th June, 1701.The Commons demanded a conference with the Lords on the
trial of Lord Somers, which the Lords refused, and proceeding on the
trial, the Commons would not attend, and he was acquitted.I went to congratulate the arrival of that worthy and
excellent person my Lord Galway, newly come out of Ireland, where he had
behaved himself so honestly, and to the exceeding satisfaction of the
people: but he was removed thence for being a Frenchman, though they had
not a more worthy, valiant, discreet, and trusty person in the two
kingdoms, on whom they could have relied for his conduct and fitness.He
was one who had deeply suffered, as well as the Marquis, his father, for
being Protestants.My Lord Treasurer made my grandson one of the Commissioners
of the prizes, salary L500 per annum.My grandson went to Sir Simon Harcourt, the
Solicitor-General, to Windsor, to wait on my Lord Treasurer.There had
been for some time a proposal of marrying my grandson to a daughter of
Mrs.Boscawen, sister of my Lord Treasurer, which was now far advanced.I subscribed toward rebuilding Oakwood Chapel, now,
after 200 years, almost fallen down.The weather changed from heat not much less than in Italy
or Spain for some few days, to wet, dripping, and cold, with
intermissions of fair.I went to Kensington, and saw the house,
plantations, and gardens, the work of Mr.Wise, who was there to receive
me.The death of King James, happening on the 15th of this month, N. S.,
after two or three days' indisposition, put an end to that unhappy
Prince's troubles, after a short and unprosperous reign, indiscreetly
attempting to bring in Popery, and make himself absolute, in imitation
of the French, hurried on by the impatience of the Jesuits; which the
nation would not endure.Died the Earl of Bath, whose contest with Lord Montague about the Duke
of Albemarle's estate, claiming under a will supposed to have been
forged, is said to have been worth L10,000 to the lawyers.His eldest
son shot himself a few days after his father's death; for what cause is
not clear.He was a most hopeful young man, and had behaved so bravely
against the Turks at the siege of Vienna, that the Emperor made him a
Count of the Empire.It was falsely reported that Sir Edward Seymour was
dead, a great man; he had often been Speaker, Treasurer of the Navy, and
in many other lucrative offices.He was of a hasty spirit, not at all
sincere, but head of the party at any time prevailing in Parliament.I kept my first courts in Surrey, which took up
the whole week.Hervey, a Counsellor, Justice of
Peace, and Member of Parliament, and my neighbor.I gave him six
guineas, which was a guinea a day, and to Mr.Martin, his clerk, three
guineas.I was this day 81 complete, in tolerable health,
considering my great age.I gave my vote and
interest to Sir R. Onslow and Mr.[Sidenote: LONDON]

21st January, 1701-02.At the Royal Society there was read and approved
the delineation and description of my Tables of Veins and Arteries, by
Mr.Cooper, the chirurgeon, in order to their being engraved.The King had a fall from his horse, and broke his
collar bone, and having been much indisposed before, and aguish, with a
long cough and other weakness, died this Sunday morning, about four
o'clock.I carried my accounts of Greenwich Hospital to the Committee.My brother-in-law, Glanville, departed this life this
morning after a long languishing illness, leaving a son by my sister,
and two granddaughters.Our relation and friendship had been long and
great.He died in the 84th year of his
age, and willed his body to be wrapped in lead and carried down to
Greenwich, put on board a ship, and buried in the sea, between Dover and
Calais, about the Goodwin sands; which was done on the Tuesday, or
Wednesday after.This occasioned much discourse, he having no relation
at all to the sea.He was a gentleman of an ancient family in
Devonshire, and married my sister Jane.By his prudent parsimony he much
improved his fortune.He had a place in the Alienation Office, and might
have been an extraordinary man, had he cultivated his parts.My steward at Wotton gave a very honest account of what he had laid out
on repairs, amounting to L1,900.The report of the committee sent to examine the state of
Greenwich hospital was delivered to the House of Commons, much to their
satisfaction.Being elected a member of the Society lately incorporated for the
propagation of the Gospel in foreign parts, I subscribed L10 per annum
toward the carrying it on.We agreed that every missioner, besides the
L20 to set him forth, should have L50 per annum out of the stock of the
Corporation, till his settlement was worth to him L100 per annum.We
sent a young divine to New York.I dined at the Archbishop's with the newly made Bishop
of Carlisle, Dr.Nicolson, my worthy and learned correspondent.I went to Wotton with my family for the rest of the
summer, and my son-in-law, Draper, with his family, came to stay with
us, his house at Addiscombe being new-building, so that my family was
above thirty.Most of the new Parliament were chosen of Church of
England principles, against the peevish party.The Queen was
magnificently entertained at Oxford and all the towns she passed through
on her way to Bath.Arrived now to the 82d year of my age, having read
over all that passed since this day twelvemonth in these notes, I render
solemn thanks to the Lord, imploring the pardon of my past sins, and the
assistance of his grace; making new resolutions, and imploring that he
will continue his assistance, and prepare me for my blessed Savior's
coming, that I may obtain a comfortable departure, after so long a term
as has been hitherto indulged me.I find by many infirmities this year
(especially nephritic pains) that I much decline; and yet of his
infinite mercy retain my intellect and senses in great measure above
most of my age.I have this year repaired much of the mansion house and
several tenants' houses, and paid some of my debts and engagements.My
wife, children, and family in health: for all which I most sincerely
beseech Almighty God to accept of these my acknowledgments, and that if
it be his holy will to continue me yet longer, it may be to the praise
of his infinite grace, and salvation of my soul.My kinsman, John Evelyn, of Nutfield, a young and
very hopeful gentleman, and Member of Parliament, after having come to
Wotton to see me, about fifteen days past, went to London and there died
of the smallpox.He left a brother, a commander in the army in Holland,
to inherit a fair estate.Our affairs in so prosperous a condition both by sea and land, that
there has not been so great an union in Parliament, Court, and people,
in memory of man, which God in mercy make us thankful for, and continue!The Bishop of Exeter preached before the Queen and both Houses of
Parliament at St.Paul's; they were wonderfully huzzaed in their
passage, and splendidly entertained in the city.The expectation now is, what treasure will be found on
breaking bulk of the galleon brought from Vigo by Sir George Rooke,
which being made up in an extraordinary manner in the hold, was not
begun to be opened till the fifth of this month, before two of the Privy
Council, two of the chief magistrates of the city, and the Lord
Treasurer.After the excess of honor conferred by the Queen on the Earl of
Marlborough, by making him a Knight of the Garter and a Duke, for the
success of but one campaign, that he should desire L5,000 a year to be
settled on him by Parliament out of the Post Office, was thought a bold
and unadvised request, as he had, besides his own considerable estate,
above L30,000 a year in places and employments, with L50,000 at
interest.He had married one daughter to the son of my Lord Treasurer
Godolphin, another to the Earl of Sunderland, and a third to the Earl of
Bridgewater.He is a very handsome person, well-spoken and affable, and
supports his want of acquired knowledge by keeping good company.News of Vice-Admiral Benbow's conflict with the French
fleet in the West Indies, in which he gallantly behaved himself, and was
wounded, and would have had extraordinary success, had not four of his
men-of-war stood spectators without coming to his assistance; for this,
two of their commanders were tried by a Council of War, and
executed;[94] a third was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, loss of
pay, and incapacity to serve in future.[Footnote 94: The Captains Kirby and Wade, having been tried and
    condemned to die by a court-martial held on them in the West Indies,
    were sent home in the "Bristol;" and, on its arrival at Portsmouth
    were both shot on board, not being suffered to land on English
    ground.]Oglethorpe (son of the late Sir Theo.fought on occasion of some words which passed at a committee of the
House.Oglethorpe was disarmed.The Bill against occasional
conformity was lost by one vote.Corn and provisions so cheap that the
farmers are unable to pay their rents.[Sidenote: LONDON]

February, 1703.A famous cause at the King's Bench between Mr.Fenwick
and his wife, which went for him with a great estate.The Duke of
Marlborough lost his only son at Cambridge by the smallpox.A great
earthquake at Rome, etc.A famous young woman, an Italian, was hired by
our comedians to sing on the stage, during so many plays, for which they
gave her L500; which part by her voice alone at the end of three scenes
she performed with such modesty and grace, and above all with such
skill, that there was never any who did anything comparable with their
voices.She was to go home to the Court of the King of Prussia, and I
believe carried with her out of this vain nation above L1,000, everybody
coveting to hear her at their private houses.Samuel Pepys, a very worthy,
industrious and curious person, none in England exceeding him in
knowledge of the navy, in which he had passed through all the most
considerable offices, Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty,
all which he performed with great integrity.went
out of England, he laid down his office, and would serve no more; but
withdrawing himself from all public affairs, he lived at Clapham with
his partner, Mr.Hewer, formerly his clerk, in a very noble house and
sweet place, where he enjoyed the fruit of his labors in great
prosperity.He was universally beloved, hospitable, generous, learned in
many things, skilled in music, a very great cherisher of learned men of
whom he had the conversation.His library and collection of other
curiosities were of the most considerable, the models of ships
especially.Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he
found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of
the Navy, or _Navalia_, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what
will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr.Pepys had educated in all sorts of
useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned
with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir.Pepys had
been for near forty years so much my particular friend, that Mr.Jackson
sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be one to hold up the pall at
his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing
him this last office.Rains have been great and continual, and now, near
midsummer, cold and wet.I went to Addiscombe, sixteen miles from Wotton, to
see my son-in-law's new house, the outside, to the coving, being such
excellent brickwork, based with Portland stone, with the pilasters,
windows, and within, that I pronounced it in all the points of good and
solid architecture to be one of the very best gentlemen's houses in
Surrey, when finished.I returned to Wotton in the evening, though
weary.The last week in this month an uncommon long-continued
rain, and the Sunday following, thunder and lightning.The new Commission for Greenwich hospital was sealed
and opened, at which my son-in-law, Draper, was present, to whom I
resigned my office of Treasurer.From August 1696, there had been
expended in building L89,364 14s.This day, being eighty-three years of age, upon
examining what concerned me, more particularly the past year, with the
great mercies of God preserving me, and in the same measure making my
infirmities tolerable, I gave God most hearty and humble thanks,
beseeching him to confirm to me the pardon of my sins past, and to
prepare me for a better life by the virtue of his grace and mercy, for
the sake of my blessed Savior.The wet and uncomfortable weather staying us from
church this morning, our Doctor officiated in my family; at which were
present above twenty domestics.55, 56, of the vanity of this world and uncertainty of life, and
the inexpressible happiness and satisfaction of a holy life, with
pertinent inferences to prepare us for death and a future state.I gave
him thanks, and told him I took it kindly as my funeral sermon.[Sidenote: LONDON]

26-7th November, 1703.The effects of the hurricane and tempest of
wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London,
were very dismal.As to my
own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and
valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning
the garden mount, the growing along the park meadow, the damage to my
own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be
paralleled, with anything happening in our age.I am not able to
describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.I removed to Dover Street, where I found all well;
but houses, trees, garden, etc., at Sayes Court, suffered very much.I made up my accounts, paid wages, gave rewards and
New Year's gifts, according to custom.The King of Spain[95] landing at Portsmouth, came to
Windsor, where he was magnificently entertained by the Queen, and
behaved himself so nobly, that everybody was taken with his graceful
deportment.After two days, having presented the great ladies, and
others, with valuable jewels, he went back to Portsmouth, and
immediately embarked for Spain.[Footnote 95: Charles III., afterward Emperor of Germany, by the
    title of Charles VI.]The Lord Treasurer gave my grandson the office of
Treasurer of the Stamp Duties, with a salary of L300 a year.The fast on the Martyrdom of King Charles I. was
observed with more than usual solemnity.Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford, now
died,[96] I think the oldest acquaintance now left me in the world.He
was eighty-six years of age, stark blind, deaf, and memory lost, after
having been a person of admirable parts and learning.This is a serious
alarm to me.He built a very handsome
chapel to the college, and his own tomb.He gave a legacy of money, and
a third part of his library, to his nephew, Dr.Bohun, who went hence to
his funeral.[Footnote 96: There is a very good Life of him, with his portrait
    prefixed, by Thomas Warton, Fellow of Trinity College, and Poetry
    Professor at Oxford.][Sidenote: LONDON]

7th September, 1704.This day was celebrated the thanksgiving for the
late great victory,[97] with the utmost pomp and splendor by the Queen,
Court, great Officers, Lords Mayor, Sheriffs, Companies, etc.The
streets were scaffolded from Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor presented
her Majesty with a sword, which she returned.Every company was ranged
under its banners, the city militia without the rails, which were all
hung with cloth suitable to the color of the banner.The Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, and Aldermen were in their scarlet robes, with caparisoned
horses; the Knight Marshal on horseback; the Foot-Guards; the Queen in a
rich coach with eight horses, none with her but the Duchess of
Marlborough in a very plain garment, the Queen full of jewels.Music and
trumpets at every city company.The great officers of the Crown,
Nobility, and Bishops, all in coaches with six horses, besides
innumerable servants, went to St.After
this, the Queen went back in the same order to St.The city
companies feasted all the Nobility and Bishops, and illuminated at
night.Music for the church and anthems composed by the best masters.The day before was wet and stormy, but this was one of the most serene
and calm days that had been all the year.[Footnote 97: Over the French and Bavarians, at Blenheim, 13th
    August, 1704.]Being my birthday and the 84th year of my life,
after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I
set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine
my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging his
infinite mercies to me and mine, begging his blessing, and imploring his
protection for the year following.Lord Clarendon presented me with the three volumes of
his father's "History of the Rebellion."My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr.Clarke's
continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for
his excellent performance of this year.I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the
victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand
with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to
do, without any alteration of his good-nature.He had a most rich George
in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very
plain.I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have
forgotten me.Agues and smallpox much in
every place.Great loss by fire,
burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at
Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the
carelessness of a servant.A little before, the same happened at Lord
Pembroke's, at Wilton.The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of
Algernon Percy, Admiral of the fleet to King Charles I., died in the 83d
year of her age.She was sister to the Earl of Suffolk, and left a great
estate, her jointure to descend to the Duke of Somerset.On the death of the Emperor, there was no mourning worn at Court,
because there was none at the Imperial Court on the death of King
William.I went to see Sir John Chardin, at Turnham Green, the
gardens being very fine, and exceedingly well planted with fruit.Most extravagant expense to debauch and corrupt votes
for Parliament members.I sent my grandson with his party of my
freeholders to vote for Mr.I dined at Lambeth with the Archbishop of Dublin,
Dr.King, a sharp and ready man in politics, as well as very learned.We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir,
which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by one who
went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came along among the
adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the doctor
had written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations.He
is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St.John's College,
Oxford, in which city he practiced physic, but has now altogether given
it over, and lives retired, being very old and infirm, yet continuing
chemistry.I went to Greenwich hospital, where they now began to take in wounded
and worn-out seamen, who are exceedingly well provided for.The
buildings now going on are very magnificent.[Sidenote: LONDON]

October, 1705.Observing how uncertain
great officers are of continuing long in their places, he would not
accept it, unless L2,000 a year were given him in reversion when he was
put out, in consideration of his loss of practice.His predecessors, how
little time soever they had the Seal, usually got L100,000 and made
themselves Barons.Lord Abington, Lieutenant
of the Tower, displaced, and General Churchill, brother to the Duke of
Marlborough, put in.An indication of great unsteadiness somewhere, but
thus the crafty Whig party (as called) begin to change the face of the
Court, in opposition to the High Churchmen, which was another
distinction of a party from the Low Churchmen.There had never been so great an assembly of members
on the first day of sitting, being more than 450.The votes both of the
old, as well as the new, fell to those called Low Churchmen, contrary to
all expectation.I am this day arrived to the 85th year of my age.Lord teach me so to number my days to come, that I may apply them to
wisdom!Making up my accounts for the past year, paid
bills, wages, and New Year's gifts, according to custom.Though much
indisposed and in so advanced a stage, I went to our chapel [in London]
to give God public thanks, beseeching Almighty God to assist me and my
family the ensuing year, if he should yet continue my pilgrimage here,
and bring me at last to a better life with him in his heavenly kingdom.Divers of our friends and relations dined with us this day.My indisposition increasing, I was exceedingly ill
this whole week.Notes of the sermons at the chapel in the morning and
afternoon, written with his own hand, conclude this Diary.[98]

and pious lies, lead their flock into the baleful habit of believing
things the most absurd and destitute of proof.The day after Miss V--'s funeral, everybody in the parish was talking of
the woeful cries which had been heard the night before near her grave.The inhabitants of the place, imbued with fantastic ideas that their
rector had kept alive, were dupes of the artifice employed by some of
their own number.They became convinced that there is no safety outside
of the church, of which they formed a part.Seized with horror they
determined never to pass a night near the grave of the cursed one, as
they already called the young Protestant.V-- by the instinctive
effect of prejudices inculcated when she was a Catholic, was at first a
prey to deadly anxiety; but recalling the holy life of her daughter,
she no longer doubted of her being among the number of the elect.She
guessed at the cause of the noise which was heard near the grave of her
child.In order to assure herself of the justness of her suspicions,
she besought the two neighbors of whom I have already spoken, to conceal
themselves there the following night.These persons were glad of an
occasion to test the accuracy of what a curate of their acquaintance had
told them; who had asserted that a spirit free from the body could yet
manifest itself substantially to the living, as speaking without tongue,
touching without hands.They discovered the man who was paid to play the ghost; they seized him,
and in order to punish him, tied him to a tree, at the foot of which
Miss V-- was buried.The poor creature the next morning no longer acted
the soul in torment, but shouted like a person who very much wanted his
breakfast.At noon one of his friends passed by who, hearing him implore
assistance, approached and set him free.Overwhelmed with questions and
derision, the false ghost confessed he had acted thus only to obtain
the reward which had been promised him.You may easily guess that
the ridicule and reprobation turned upon those who had made him their
instrument.I will not finish this narrative without telling the reader that the
curate of the place appeared much incensed at what his parishioners
had done.I am glad to be able to suppose that he condemns rather
than encourages such conduct.A Protestant friend of mine who does not
entertain the same respect for the Roman clergy that I do, advances the
opinion that the displeasure of the curate was not on account of the
culpable attempt of some of his flock but on account of its failure.However, I must add, on my reputation as a faithful narrator, that
nothing has yet happened to confirm his assertion.ERASTE D'ORSONNENS.CRUELTY OF ROMANISTS.To show that the Romish priests have in all ages, and do still, inflict
upon their victims cruelties quite as severe as anything described in
the foregoing pages, and that such cruelties are sanctioned by their
code of laws, we have only to turn to the authentic history of the past
and present transactions of the high functionaries of Rome.About the year 1356, Nicholas Eymeric, inquisitor-general of Arragon,
collected from the civil and canon laws all that related to the
punishment of heretics, and formed the "Directory of Inquisitors," the
first and indeed the fundamental code, which has been followed ever
since, without any essential variation."It exhibits the practice and
theory of the Inquisition at the time of its sanction by the approbation
of Gregory 13th, in 1587, which theory, under some necessary variations
of practice, still remains unchanged."From this "Directory," transcribed by the Rev.Rule of London, in
1852, we extract a few sentences in relation to torture."Torture is inflicted on one who confesses the principal fact, but
varies as to circumstances.Also on one who is reputed to be a heretic,
but against whom there is only one witness of the fact.In this case
common rumor is one indication of guilt, and the direct evidence is
another, making altogether but semi-plenar proof.Also, when there is no witness, but vehement suspicion.Also when there is no common report of heresy, but only one witness
who has heard or seen something in him contrary to the faith.Any two
indications of heresy will justify the use of torture.If you sentence
to torture, give him a written notice in the form prescribed; but other
means be tried first.Nor is this an infallible means for bringing out
the truth.Weak-hearted men, impatient at the first pain, will confess
crimes they never committed, and criminate others at the same time.Bold
and strong ones will bear the most severe torments.Those who have been
on the rack before bear it with more courage, for they know how to adapt
their limbs to it, and they resist powerfully.Others, by enchantments,
seem to be insensible, and would rather die than confess.These wretches
user for incantations, certain passages from the Psalms of David, or
other parts of Scripture, which they write on virgin parchment in an
extravagant way, mixing them with names of unknown angels, with circles
and strange letters, which they wear upon their person.'I know not,'
says Pena, 'how this witchcraft can be remedied, but it will be well to
strip the criminals naked, and search them narrowly, before laying them
upon the rack.'While the tormentor is getting ready, let the inquisitor
and other grave men make fresh attempts to obtain a confession of the
truth.Let the tormentors TERRIFY HIM BY ALL MEANS, TO FRIGHTEN HIM INTO
CONFESSION.And after he is stripped, let the inquisitor take him aside,
and make a last effort.When this has failed, let him be put to the
question by torture, beginning with interrogation on lesser points,
and advancing to greater.If he stands out, let them show him other
instruments of torture, and threaten that he shall suffer them also.If
he will not confess; the torture may be continued on the second or third
day; but as it is not to be repeated, those successive applications must
be called CONTINUATION.And if, after all, he does not confess, he may
be set at liberty."Rules are laid down for the punishment of those who do confess.commanded the secular judges to put heretics to torture; but that
gave occasion to scandalous publicity, and now inquisitors are empowered
to do it, and, in case of irregularity (THAT IS, IF THE PERSON DIES IN
THEIR HANDS), TO ABSOLVE EACH OTHER.And although nobles were exempt
from torture, and in some kingdoms, as Arragon, it was not used in civil
tribunals, the inquisitors were nevertheless authorized to torture,
without restriction, persons of all classes.And here we digress from Eymeric and Pena, in order to describe, from
additional authority, of what this torture consisted, and probably,
still consists, in Italy.Limborch collects this information from Juan
de Rojas, inquisitor at Valencia."There were five degrees of torment as some counted (Eymeric included),
or according to others, three.First, there was terror, including
the threatenings of the inquisitor, leading to the place of torture,
stripping, and binding; the stripping of their clothing, both men and
women, with the substitution of a single tight garment, to cover part
of the person--being an outrage of every feeling of decency--and the
binding, often as distressing as the torture itself.Secondly came the
stretching on the rack, and questions attendant.Thirdly a more severe
shock, by the tension and sodden relaxation of the cord, which is
sometimes given once, but often twice, thrice, or yet more frequently.""Isaac Orobio, a Jewish physician, related to Limborch the manner in
which he had himself been tortured, when thrown into the inquisition at
Seville, on the delation of a Moorish servant, whom he had punished for
theft, and of another person similarly offended."After having been in the prison of the inquisition for full three
years, examined a few times, but constantly refusing to confess the
things laid to his charge, he was at length brought out of the cell,
and led through tortuous passages to the place of torment.He found himself in a subterranean chamber, rather spacious,
arched over, and hung with black cloth.The whole conclave was lighted
by candles in sconces on the walls.At one end there was a separate
chamber, wherein were an inquisitor and his notary seated at a table.The place, gloomy, intent, and everywhere terrible, seemed to be the
very home of death.Hither he was brought, and the inquisitor again
exhorted him to tell the truth before the torture should begin.On his
answering that he had already told the truth, the inquisitor gravely
protested that he was bringing himself to the torture by his own
obstinacy; and that if he should suffer loss of blood, or even expire,
during the question, the holy office would be blameless.Having thus
spoken, the inquisitor left him in the hands of the tormentors, who
stripped him, and compressed his body so tightly in a pair of linen
drawers, that he could no longer draw breath, and must have died, had
they not suddenly relaxed the pressure; but with recovered breathing
came pain unutterably exquisite.The anguish being past, they repeated a
monition to confess the truth, before the torture, as they said, should
begin; and the same was afterwards repeated at each interval."As Orobio persisted in denial, they bound his thumbs so tightly with
small cords that the blood burst from under the nails, and they were
swelled excessively.Then they made him stand against the wall on
a small stool, passed cords around various parts of his body, but
principally around the arms and legs, and carried them over iron
pulleys in the ceiling.The tormentor then pulled the cords with all his
strength, applying his feet to the wall, and giving the weight of his
body to increase the purchase.With these ligatures his arms and legs,
fingers and toes, were so wrung and swollen that he felt as if fire were
devouring them.In the midst of this torment the man kicked down the
stool which had supported his feet, so that he hung upon the cords
with his whole weight, which suddenly increased their tension, and
gave indescribable aggravation to his pain.An instrument resembling a small ladder, consisting of two
parallel pieces of wood, and five transverse pieces, with the anterior
edges sharpened, was placed before him, so that when the tormentor
struck it heavily, he received the stroke five times multiplied on each
shin bone, producing pain that was absolutely intolerable, and under
which he fainted.But no sooner was he revived than they inflicted a new
torture.The tormentor tied other cords around his wrists, and having
his own shoulders covered with leather, that they might not be chafed,
passed round them the rope which was to draw the cords, set his feet
against the wall, threw himself back with all his force, and the cords
cut through to the bones.This he did thrice, each time changing the
position of the cords, leaving a small distance between the successive
wounds; but it happened that in pulling the second time they slipped
into the first wounds, and caused such a gush of blood that Orobio
seemed to be bleeding to death."A physician and surgeon, who were in waiting as usual, to give their
opinion as to the safety or danger of continuing those operations,
that the inquisitors might not commit an irregularity by murdering the
patient, were called in.Being friends of the sufferer, they gave their
opinion that he had strength enough remaining to bear more.By this
means they saved him from a SUSPENSION of the torture, which would have
been followed by a repetition, on his recovery, under the pretext of
CONTINUATION.The cords were therefore pulled a third time, and this
ended the torture.He was dressed in his own clothes, carried back to
prison, and, after about seventy days, when the wounds were healed,
condemned as one SUSPECTED of Judaism.They could not say CONVICTED,
because he had not confessed; but they sentenced him to wear the
sambenito [Footnote: This sambenito (Suco bendito or blessed sack,) is
a garment (or kind of scapulary according to some writers,) worn by
penitents of the least criminal class in the procession of an Auto de
Fe, (a solemn ceremony held by the Inquisition for the punishment of
heretics,) but sometimes worn as a punishment at other times, that the
condemned one might be marked by his neighbors, and ever bear a signal
that would affright and scare by the greatness of the punishment and
disgrace; a plan, salutary it may be, but very grievous to the offender.It was made of yellow cloth, with a St.Andrew's cross upon it, of
red.A rope was sometimes put around the neck as an additional mark of
infamy."Those who were condemned to be burnt were distinguished by a habit of
the same form, called Zamarra, but instead of the red cross were
painted flames and devils, and sometimes an ugly portrait of the heretic
himself,--a head, with flames under it.Those who had been sentenced to
the stake, but indulged with commutation of the penalty, had inverted
flames painted on the livery, and this was called fuego revuelto,
"inverted fire.""Upon the head of the condemned was also placed a conical paper cap,
about three feet high, slightly resembling a mitre, called corona or
crown.This was painted with flames and devils in like manner with the
dress.]or penitential habit for two years, and then be banished for
life from Seville."INQUISITION OF GOA--IMPRISONMENT OF M. DELLON, 1673."M. Dellon a French traveller, spending some time at Damaun, on the
north-western coast of Hindostan, incurred the jealousy of the governor
and a black priest, in regard to a lady, as he is pleased to call
her, whom they both admired.He had expressed himself rather freely
concerning some of the grosser superstitions of Romanism, and thus
afforded the priest, who was also secretary of the Inquisition, an
occasion of proceeding against him as a heretic.The priest and the
governor united in a representation to the chief inquisitor at Goa,
which procured an order for his arrest.Like all other persons whom it
pleased the inquisitors or their servants to arrest, in any part of the
Portuguese dominions beyond the Cape of Good Hope, he was thrown into
prison with a promiscuous crowd of delinquents, the place and treatment
being of the worst kind, even according to the colonial barbarism of
the seventeenth century.To describe his sufferings there, is not to our
purpose, inasmuch as all prisoners fared alike, many of them perishing
from starvation and disease.Many offenders against the Inquisition
were there at the same time,--some accused of Judaism, others, of
Paganism--in which sorcery and witchcraft were included--and others of
immorality.In a field so wide and so fruitful, the "scrutators" of the
faith could not fail to gather abundantly.After an incarceration of at
least four months, he and his fellow-sufferers were shipped off for
the ecclesiastical metropolis of India, all of them being in irons.The
vessel put into Bacaim, and the prisoners were transferred, for some
days, to the prison of that town, where a large number of persons were
kept in custody, under charge of the commissary of the holy office,
until a vessel should arrive to carry them to Goa."In due time they were again at sea, and a fair wind wafted their
fleet into that port after a voyage of seven days.Until they could
be deposited in the cells of the Inquisition with the accustomed
formalities, the Archbishop of Goa threw open HIS prison for their
reception, which prison, being ecclesiastical, may be deemed worthy of
description."The most filthy," says Dellon, "the most dark, and the most horrible
that I ever saw; and I doubt whether a more shocking and horrible prison
can be found anywhere.It is a kind of cave wherein there is no day seen
but by a very little hole; the most subtle rays of the sun cannot enter
into it, and there is never any true light in it.* * *

"On the 16th of January 1674, at eight o'clock in the morning, an
officer came with orders to take the prisoners to "the holy house."With
considerable difficulty M. Dellon dragged his iron-loaded limbs thither.They helped him to ascend the stairs at the great entrance, and in the
hall, smiths were waiting to take off the irons from all the prisoners.One by one, they were summoned to audience.Dellon, who was called the
first, crossed the hall, passed through an ante-chamber, and entered
a room, called by the Portuguese "board of the holy office," where the
grand inquisitor of the Indies sat at one end of a very large table, on
an elevated floor in the middle of the chamber.He was a secular priest
about forty years of age, in full vigor--a man who could do his work
with energy.At one end of the room was a large crucifix, reaching from
the floor almost to the ceiling, and near it, sat a notary on a folding
stool.At the opposite end, and near the inquisitor, Dellon was placed,
and, hoping to soften his judge, fell on his knees before him.But the
inquisitor commanded him to rise, asked whether he knew the reason of
his arrest, and advised him to declare it at large, as that was the only
way to obtain a speedy release.Dellon caught at the hope of release,
began to tell his tale, mixed with tears and protestations, again
fell at the feet of Don Francisco Delgado Ematos, the inquisitor, and
implored his favorable attention.Don Francisco told him, very coolly,
that he had other business on hand, and, nothing moved, rang a silver
bell.The alcayde entered, led the prisoner out into a gallery, opened,
and searched his trunk, stripped him of every valuable, wrote an
inventory, assured him that all should be safely kept, and then led him
to a cell about ten feet square, and left him there, shut up in utter
solitude.In the evening they brought him his first meal, which he ate
heartily, and slept a little during the night following.Next morning he
learnt that he could have no part of his property, not even a breviary
was, in that place, allowed to a priest, for they had no form of
religion there, and for that reason he could not have a book.His hair
was cropped close; and therefore "he did not need a comb.""Thus began his acquaintance with the holy house, which he describes
as "great and magnificent," on one side of the great space before the
church of St Catharine.There were three gates in front; and, it was
by the central, or largest, that the prisoners entered, and mounted a
stately flight of steps, leading into the great hall.The side gates
provided entrance to spacious ranges of apartments, belonging to the
inquisitors.Behind the principal building, was another, very spacious,
two stories high, and consisting of double rows of cells, opening into
galleries that ran from end to end.The cells on the ground-floor were
very small, without any aperture from without for light or air.Those of
the upper story were vaulted, white-washed, had a small strongly grated
window, without glass, and higher than the tallest man could reach.Towards the gallery every cell was shut with two doors, one on the
inside, the other one outside of the wall.The inner door folded, was
grated at the bottom, opened towards the top for the admission of food
and was made fast with very strong bolts.The outer door was not so
thick, had no window, but was left open from six o'clock every morning
until eleven--a necessary arrangement in that climate, unless it were
intended to destroy life by suffocation."To each prisoner was given as earthen pot with water wherewith to wash,
another full of water to drink, with a cup; a broom, a mat whereon
to lie, and a large basin with a cover, changed every fourth day.The
prisoners had three meals a day; and their health so far as food could
contribute to it in such a place, was cared for in the provision of
a wholesome, but spare diet.Physicians were at hand to render all
necessary assistance to the sick, as were confessors, ready to wait
upon the dying; but they gave no viaticum, performed no unction, said
no mass.The place was under an impenetrable interdict.If any died,
and that many did die is beyond question, his death was unknown to all
without; he was buried within the walls without any sacred ceremony;
and if, after death, he was found to have died in heresy, his bones were
taken up at the next Auto, to be burned.Unless there happened to be
an unusual number of prisoners, each one was alone in his own cell.He
might not speak, nor groan, nor sob aloud, nor sigh.[Footnote: Limborch
relates that on one occasion, a poor prisoner was heard to cough; the
jailer of the Inquisition instantly repaired to him, and warned him to
forbear, as the slightest noise was not tolerated in that house.The
poor man replied that it was not in his power to forbear; a second time
they admonished him to desist; and when again, unable to do otherwise,
he repeated the offence, they stripped him naked, and cruelly beat him.This increased his cough, for which they beat him so often, that at last
he died through pain and anguish of the stripes he had received.]His
breathing might be audible when the guard listened at the grating, but
nothing more.Four guards were stationed in each long gallery, open,
indeed, at each end, but awfully silent, as if it were the passage of
a catacomb.If, however, he wanted anything, he might tap at the inner
door, when a jailer would come to hear the request, and would report to
the alcayde, but was not permitted to answer.If one of the victims, in
despair, or pain, or delirium, attempted to pronounce a prayer, even to
God, or dared to utter a cry, the jailers would run to the cell, rush
in, and beat him cruelly, for terror to the rest.Once in two months the
inquisitor, with a secretary and an interpreter, visited the prisons,
and asked each prisoner if he wanted anything, if his meat was regularly
brought, and if he had any complaint against the jailers.His want after
all lay at the mercy of the merciless.His complaint, if uttered, would
bring down vengeance, rather than gain redress.But in this visitation
the holy office professed mercy with much formality, and the
inquisitorial secretary collected notes which aided in the crimination,
or in the murder of their victims."The officers of Goa were;--the inquisidor mor or grand inquisitor, who
was always a secular priest; the second inquisitor, Dominican friar;
several deputies, who came, when called for, to assist the inquisitors
at trials, but never entered without such a summons; qualifiers,
as usual, to examine books and writings, but never to witness an
examination of the living, or be present at any act of the kind; a
fiscal; a procurator; advocates, so called, for the accused; notaries
and familiars.The authority of this tribunal was absolute in Goa.There does not appear to have been anything peculiar in the manner of
examining and torturing at Goa where the practice coincided with that of
Portugal and Spain."The personal narrative of Dellon affords a distinct exemplification of
the sufferings of the prisoners.He had been told that, when he desired
an audience, he had only to call a jailer, and ask it, when it would be
allowed him.But, notwithstanding many tears and entreaties, he could
not obtain one until fifteen days had passed away.Then came the alcayde
and one of his guards.This alcayde walked first out of the cell; Dellon
uncovered and shorn, and with legs and feet bare, followed him; the
guard walked behind.The alcayde just entered the place of audience,
made a profound reverence, stepped back and allowed his charge to enter.The door closed, and Dellon remained alone with the inquisitor and
secretary.He knelt; but Don Fernando sternly bade him to sit on a
bench, placed there for the use of the culprits.Near him, on a table,
lay a missal, on which they made him lay his hand, and swear to keep
secrecy, and tell them the truth.They asked if he knew the cause of his
imprisonment, and whether he was resolved to confess it.He told
them all he could recollect of unguarded sayings at Damaun, either in
argument or conversation, without ever, that he knew, contradicting,
directly or indirectly, any article of faith.He had, at some time
dropped an offensive word concerning the Inquisition, but so light a
word, that it did not occur to his remembrance.Don Fernando told him he
had done well in ACCUSING HIMSELF so willingly, and exhorted him in the
name of Jesus Christ, to complete his self accusation fully, to the end
that he might experience the goodness and mercy which were used in
that tribunal towards those who showed true repentance by a sincere
and UNFORCED confession.The secretary read aloud the confession and
exhortation, Dellon signed it, Don Fernando rang a silver bell, the
alcayde walked in, and, in a few moments, the disappointed victim was
again in his dungeon."At the end of another fortnight, and without having asked for it, he
was again taken to audience.After a repetition of the former questions,
he was asked his name, surname, baptism, confirmation, place of abode,
in what parish?They made him kneel,
and make the sign of the cross, repeat the Pater Noster, Hail Mary,
creed, commandments of God, commandments of the church, and Salve
Begins.He did it all very cleverly, and even to their satisfaction;
but the grand inquisitor exhorted him, by the tender mercies of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to confess without delay, and sent him to the cell again.They required him to do what was impossible--to
confess more, after he had acknowledged ALL.In despair, he tried to
starve himself to death; 'but they compelled him to take food.'Day and
night he wept, and at length betook himself to prayer, imploring pity
of the 'blessed Virgin,' whom he imagined to be, of all beings, the most
merciful, and the most ready to give him help."At the end of a month, he succeeded in obtaining another audience, and
added to his former confessions what he had remembered, for the first
time, touching the Inquisition.But they told him that that was not what
they wanted, and sent him back again.In a frenzy
of despair he determined to commit suicide, if possible.Feigning
sickness, be obtained a physician who treated him for a fever, and
ordered him to be bled.Never calmed by any treatment of the physician,
blood-letting was repeated often, and each time he untied the bandage,
when left alone, hoping to die from loss of blood, but death fled from
him.A humane Franciscan came to confess him, and, hearing his tale of
misery, gave him kind words, asked permission to divulge his attempt
at self-destruction to the inquisitor, procured him a mitigation of
solitude by the presence of a fellow-prisoner, a <DW64>, accused of
magic; but, after five months, the <DW64> was removed, and his mind,
broken with suffering, could no longer bear up under the aggravated
load.By an effort of desperate ingenuity he almost succeeded in
committing suicide, and a jailer found him weltering in his blood and
insensible.Having restored him by cordials, and bound up his wounds,
they carried him into the presence of the inquisitor once more; where he
lay on the floor, being unable to sit, heard bitter reproaches, had his
limbs confined in irons, and was thus carried back to a punishment that
seemed more terrible than death.In fetters he became so furious, that
they found it necessary to take them off, and, from that time, his
examinations assumed another character, as he defended his positions
with citations from the Council of Trent, and with some passages of
scripture, which he explained in the most Romish sense, discovering
a depth of ignorance in Don Fernando that was truly surprising.That
'grand Inquisitor,' had never heard the passage which Dellon quoted to
prove the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, 'Except a man be born
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'Neither did he know anything of that famous passage in the twenty-fifth
session of the Council of Trent, which declares that images are only to
be reverenced on account of the persons whom they represent.He
called for a Bible, and for the acts of the council, and was evidently
surprised when he found them where Dellon told him they might be seen."The time for a general auto drew near.During the months of November
and December, 1675, he heard every morning the cries of persons under
torture, and afterwards saw many of them, both men and women, lame and
distorted by the rack.On Sunday January 11th, 1676, he was surprised
by the jailer refusing to receive his linen to be washed--Sunday being
washing-day in the 'holy house.'While perplexing himself to think
what that could mean, the cathedral bells rang for vespers, and then,
contrary to custom, rang again for matins.He could only account for
that second novelty by supposing that an auto would be celebrated the
next day.They brought him supper, which he refused, and, contrary to
their wont at all other times, they did not insist on his taking it, but
carried it away.Assured that those were all portents of the horrible
catastrophe, and reflecting on often-repeated threats in the audience
chamber that he should be burnt, he gave himself up to death, and
overwhelmed with sorrow, fell asleep a little before midnight."Scarcely had he fallen asleep when the alcayde and guards entered the
cell, with great noise, bringing a lamp, for the first time since his
imprisonment that they had allowed a lamp to shine there.The alcayde,
laying down a suit of clothes, bade him put them on, and be ready to go
out when he came again.At two o'clock in the morning they returned, and
he issued from the cell, clad in a black vest and trowsers, striped with
white, and his feet bare.About two hundred prisoners, of whom he
was one, were made to sit on the floor, along the sides of a spacious
gallery, all in the same black livery, and just visible by the
gleaming of a few lamps.A large company of women were also ranged in a
neighboring gallery in like manner.But they were all motionless, and
no one knew his doom.Every eye was fixed, and each one seemed benumbed
with misery."A third company Dellon perceived in a room not far distant, but they
were walking about, and some appeared to have long habits.Those were
persons condemned to be delivered to the secular arm, and the long
habits distinguished confessors busily collecting confessions in order
to commute that penalty for some other scarcely less dreadful.At four
o'clock, servants of the house came, with guards, and gave bread and
figs to those who would accept the refreshment.One of the guards gave
Dellon some hope of life by advising him to take what was offered,
which he had refused to do.'Take your bread,' said the man, 'and if you
cannot eat it now, put it in your pocket; you will be certainly hungry
before you return.'This gave hope, that he should not end the day at
the stake, but come back to undergo penance."A little before sunrise, the great bell of the cathedral tolled, and
its sound soon aroused the city of Goa.The people ran into the streets,
lining the chief thoroughfares, and crowding every place whence a view
could be had of the procession.Day broke, and Dellon saw the faces
of his fellow-prisoners, most of whom were Indians.He could only
distinguish, by their complexion, about twelve Europeans.Every
countenance exhibited shame, fear, grief, or an appalling blackness of
apathy, AS IF DIRE SUFFERING IN THE LIGHTLESS DUNGEONS UNDERNEATH HAD
BEREFT THEM OF INTELLECT.The company soon began to move, but slowly,
as one by one the alcayde led them towards the door of the great hall,
where the grand inquisitor sat, and his secretary called the name of
each as he came, and the name of a sponsor, who also presented himself
from among a crowd of the bettermost inhabitants of Goa, assembled there
for that service.'The general of the Portuguese ships in the Indies'
had the honor of placing himself beside our Frenchman.As soon as the
procession was formed, it marched off in the usual order."First, the Dominicans, honored with everlasting precedence on all such
occasions, led the way.Singing-boys also preceded, chanting a litany.The banner of the Inquisition was intrusted to their hands.After the
banner walked the penitents--a penitent and a sponsor, two and two.A
cross bearer brought up the train, carrying a crucifix aloft, turned
towards them, in token of pity; and, on looking along the line, you
might have seen another priest going before the penitents with a
crucifix turned backwards, inviting their devotions.They to whom the
Inquisition no longer afforded mercy, walked behind the penitents, and
could only see an averted crucifix.These were condemned to be burnt
alive at the stake!On this occasion there were but two of this class,
but sometimes a large number were sentenced to this horrible death, and
presented to the spectator a most pitiable spectacle.Many of them
bore upon their persons the marks of starvation, torture, terror, and
heart-rending grief.Some faces were bathed in tears, while others
came forth with a smile of conquest on the countenance and words of
triumphant faith bursting from the lips.These, however, were known as
dogmatizers, and were generally gagged, the month being filled with a
piece of wood kept in by a strong leather band fastened behind the head,
and the arms tied together behind the back.Two armed familiars walked
or rode beside each of these, and two ecclesiastics, or some other
clerks or regulars, also attended.After these, the images of heretics
who had escaped were carried aloft, to be thrown into the flames; and
porters came last, tagging under the weight of boxes containing the
disinterred bodies on which the execution of the church had fallen, and
which were also to be burnt."Poor Dellon went barefoot, like the rest, through the streets of Goa,
rough with little flint stones scattered about, and sorely were his feet
wounded during an hour's march up and down the principal streets.Weary,
covered with shame and confusion, the long train of culprits entered
the church of St.Francis, where preparation was made for the auto, the
climate of India not permitting a celebration of that solemnity
under the burning sky.They sat with their sponsors, in the galleries
prepared, sambenitos, grey zamarras with painted flames and devils,
corozas, tapers, and all the other paraphernalia of an auto, made up a
woeful spectacle.The inquisitor and other personages having taken their
seats of state, the provincial of the Augustinians mounted the pulpit
and delivered the sermon.Dellon preserved but one note of it.The
preacher compared the Inquisition to Noah's ark, which received all
sorts of beasts WILD, but sent them out TAME.The appearance of hundreds
who had been inmates of that ark certainly justified the figure."After the sermon, two readers went up, one after the other, into the
same pulpit, and, between them, they read the processes and pronounced
the sentences, the person standing before them, with the alcayde, and
holding a lighted taper in his hand.Dellon, in turn, heard the cause
of his long-suffering.He had maintained the invalidity of baptismus
flaminis, or desire to be baptised, when there is no one to administer
the rite of baptism by water.He had said that images ought not to be
adored, and that an ivory crucifix was a piece of ivory.He had spoken
contemptuously of the Inquisition.And, above all, he had an ill
intention.His punishment was to be confiscation of his property,
banishment from India, and five years' service in the galleys in
Portugal, with penance, as the inquisitors might enjoin.As all the
prisoners were excommunicate, the inquisitor, after the sentence had
been pronounced, put on his alb and stole, walked into the middle of the
church, and absolved them all at once.Dellon's sponsor, who would not
even answer him before, when he spoke, now embraced him, called him
brother, and gave him a pinch of snuff, in token of reconciliation."But there were two persons, a man and a woman, for whom the church had
no more that they could do; and these, with four dead bodies, and the
effigies of the dead, were taken to be burnt on the Campo Santo Lazaro,
on the river side, the place appointed for that purpose, that the
viceroy might see justice done on the heretics, as he surveyed the
execution from his palace-windows."The remainder of Dellon's history adds nothing to what we have already
heard of the Inquisition.He was taken to Lisbon, and, after working in
a gang of convicts for some time, was released on the intercession of
some friends in France with the Portuguese government.With regard to
his despair, and attempts to commit suicide, when in the holy house,
we may observe that, as he states, suicide was very frequent there.The contrast of his disconsolate impatience with the resignation and
constancy of Christian confessors in similar circumstances, is obvious.As a striking illustration of the difference between those who suffer
without a consciousness of divine favor, and those who rejoice with joy
unspeakable and full of glory, we would refer the reader to that noble
band of martyrs who suffered death at the stake, at the Auto held in
Seville, on Sunday, September 24, 1559.At that time twenty-one
were burnt, followed by one effigy, and eighteen penitents, who were
released."One of the former was Don Juan Gonzales, Presbyter of Seville, an
eminent preacher.With admirable constancy he refused to make any
declaration, in spite of the severe torture, saying that he had not
followed any erroneous opinions, but that he had drawn his faith from
the holy Scriptures; and for this faith he pleaded to his tormentors in
the words of inspiration.He maintained that he was not a heretic, but
a Christian, and absolutely refused to divulge anything that would bring
his brethren into trouble.Two sisters of his were also brought out to
this Auto, and displayed equal faith.They would confess Christ, they
said, and suffer with their brother, whom they revered as a wise and
holy man.They were all tied to stakes on the quemadero, a piece of
pavement, without the walls of the city, devoted to the single use of
burning human victims.Sandra went to the bathroom.Sometimes this quemadero [Footnote: Llorente, the
historian of the Spanish Inquisition, says, "So many persons were to be
put to death by fire, the governor of Seville caused a permanent raised
platform of masonry to be constructed outside the city, which has
lasted to our time (until the French revolution) retaining its name of
Quemadero, or burning-place, and at the four corners four large hollow
stalutes of limestone, within which they used to place the impenitent
alive, that they might die by slow fires."]was a raised platform of
stone, adorned with pillows or surrounded with statues, to distinguish
and beautify the spot.Just as the fire was lit, the gag, which had
hitherto silenced Don Juan, was removed, and as the flames burst from
the fagots, he said to his sisters, 'Let us sing, Deus laudem meam ne
tacueris.'And they sang together, while burning, 'Hold not thy peace,
O God of my praise; for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the
deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a
lying tongue.'Thus they died in the faith of Christ, and of his holy
gospel."INQUISITION OF GOA, CONCLUDED.The Inquisition of Goa continued its Autos for a century after the
affair of Dellon.Claudius Buchanan visited
that city, and had been unexpectedly invited by Joseph a Doloribus,
second and most active inquisitor, to lodge with him during his
visit.Buchanan found himself, heretic,
schismatic, and rebel as he was, politely entertained by so dread a
personage.Regarding his English visitor merely as a literary man, or
professing to do so, Friar Joseph, himself well educated, seemed to
enjoy his company, and was unreservedly communicative on every subject
not pertaining to his own vocation.When that subject was first
introduced by an apparently incidental question, he did not hesitate
to return the desired information, telling Dr.Buchanan that the
establishment was nearly as extensive as in former times.In the library
of the chief inquisitor he saw a register containing the names of all
the officers, who still were numerous.On the second evening after his arrival, the doctor was surprised to see
his host come from his apartment, clothed in black robes from head to
foot, instead of white, the usual color of his order (Augustinian).He
said that he was going to sit on the tribunal of the holy office, and it
transpired that, so far from his "august office" not occupying much of
his time, he had to sit there three or four days every week.After his
return, in the evening, the doctor put Dellon's book into his hand,
asking him if he had ever seen it.He had never seen it before, and,
after reading aloud and slowly, "Relation de l'Inquisition de Goa,"
began to peruse it with eagerness.Buchanan employed himself in writing, Friar Joseph devoured
page after page; but as the narrative proceeded, betrayed evident
symptoms of uneasiness.He then turned to the middle, looked at the end,
skimmed over the table of contents, fixed on its principal passages,
and at one place exclaimed, in his broad Italian accent, "Mendacium!The doctor requested him to mark the passages that were
untrue, proposed to discuss them afterwards, and said he had other books
on the subject.The mention of other books startled him; he looked up
anxiously at some books on the table, and then gave himself up to the
perusal of Dellon's "Relation," until bedtime.Even then, he asked
permission to take it to his chamber.The doctor had fallen asleep under the roof of the inquisitor's convent,
confident, under God, in the protection at that time guaranteed to
a British subject, his servants sleeping in the gallery outside
the chamber-door.About midnight, he was waked by loud shrieks and
expressions of terror from some one in the gallery.In the first moment
of surprise, he concluded it must be the alguazils of the holy office
seizing his servants to carry them to the Inquisition.But, on going
out, he saw the servants standing at the door, and the person who
had caused the alarm, a boy of about fourteen, at a little distance,
surrounded by some of the priests, who had come out of their cells on
hearing the noise.The boy said he had seen a spectre; and it was a
considerable time before the agitations of his body and voice
subsided.Next morning at breakfast, the inquisitor apologized for
the disturbance, and said the boy's alarm proceeded from a phantasma
animi,--phantom of the imagination.Phantoms might well haunt such a place.As to
Dellon's book, the inquisitor acknowledged that the descriptions
were just; but complained that he had misjudged the motives of the
inquisitors, and written uncharitably of Holy Church.Their conversation
grew earnest, and the inquisitor was anxious to impress his visitor with
the idea that the Inquisition had undergone a change in some respects,
and that its terrors were mitigated.Buchanan plainly
requested to see the Inquisition, that he might judge for himself as to
the humanity shown to the inmates,--according to the inquisitor,--and
gave, as a reason why he should be satisfied, his interest in the
affairs of India, on which he had written, and his purpose to write on
them again, in which case he could scarcely be silent concerning the
Inquisition.The countenance of his host fell; but, after some further
observations, he reluctantly promised to comply.Next morning, after
breakfast, Joseph a Doloribus went to dress for the holy office, and
soon returned in his black robes.He said he would go half an hour
before the usual time, for the purpose of showing him the Inquisition.The doctor fancied he looked more severe than usual, and that his
attendants were not as civil as before.But the truth was, that the
midnight scene still haunted him.They had proceeded in their palanquins
to the holy house, distant about a quarter of a mile from the convent,
and the inquisitor said as they were ascending the steps of the great
entrance, that he hoped the doctor would be satisfied with a transient
view of the Inquisition, and would retire when he should desire him to
do so.The doctor followed with tolerable confidence, towards the
great hall aforementioned, where they were met by several well-dressed
persons, familiars, as it afterwards appeared, who bowed very low to the
inquisitor, and looked with surprise at the stranger.Buchanan paced
the hall slowly, and in thoughtful silence; the inquisitor thoughtful
too, silent and embarrassed.A multitude of victims seemed to haunt the
place, and the doctor could not refrain from breaking silence."Would
not the Holy Church wish, in her mercy, to have those souls back again,
that she might allow them a little further probation?"The inquisitor
answered nothing, but beckoned him to go with him to a door at one end
of the hall.By that door he conducted him to some small rooms, and
thence, to the spacious apartments of the chief inquisitor.Having
surveyed those, he brought him back again to the great hall, and seemed
anxious that the troublesome visitor should depart; but only the very
words of Dr.B. can adequately describe the close of this extraordinary
interview.""Now, father," said I, "lead me to the dungeons below: I want to see the
captives.""No," said he, "that cannot be."I now began to suspect that
it had been in the mind of the inquisitor, from the beginning, to show
me only a certain part of the Inquisition, in the hope of satisfying
my inquiries in a general way.I urged him with earnestness; but he
steadily resisted, and seemed offended, or, rather, agitated, by my
importunity.I intimated to him plainly, that the only way to do justice
to his own assertion and arguments regarding the present state of the
Inquisition, was to show me the prisons and the captives.I should
then describe only what I saw; but now the subject was left in awful
obscurity."Lead me down," said I, "to the inner building, and let me
pass through the two hundred dungeons, ten feet square, described by
your former captives.Let me count the number of your present captives,
and converse with them.I WANT, TO SEE IF THERE BE ANY SUBJECTS OF THE
BRITISH GOVERNMENT, TO WHOM WE OWE PROTECTION.I want to ask how long
they have been there, how long it is since they have seen the light
of the sun, and whether they ever expect to see it again.Show me the
chamber of torture, and declare what modes of execution or punishment
are now practiced inside the walls of the Inquisition, in lieu of the
public Auto de Fe.If, after all that has passed, father, you resist
this reasonable request, I should be justified in believing that you are
afraid of exposing the real state of the Inquisition in India."To these observations the inquisitor made no reply; but seemed impatient
that I should withdraw."My good father," said I; "I am about to take
my leave of you, and to thank you for your hospitable attentions; and I
wish to preserve on my mind a favorable sentiment of your kindness and
candor.You cannot, you say, show me the captives and the dungeons; be
pleased, then, merely to answer this question, for I shall believe
your word: how many prisoners are there now below in the cells of the
Inquisition?"He replied, "That is a question which I cannot answer."On his pronouncing these words, I retired hastily towards the door, and
wished him farewell.We shook hands with as much cordiality as we could,
at the moment, assume; and both of us, I believe, were sorry that our
parting took place with a clouded countenance.Buchanan, feeling as if he could
not refrain from endeavoring to get another and perhaps a nearer view,
returned to avail himself of the pretext afforded by a promise from
the chief inquisitor, of a letter to one of the British residents at
Travancore, in answer to one which he had brought him from that officer.The inquisitors he expected to find within, in the "board of the holy
office."The door-keepers surveyed him doubtfully, but allowed him to
pass.He entered the great hall, went up directly to the lofty crucifix
described by Dellon, sat down on a form, wrote some notes, and then
desired an attendant to carry in his name to the inquisitor.As he was
walking across the hall, he saw a poor woman sitting by the wall.She
clasped her hands, and looked at him imploringly.The sight chilled
his spirits; and as he was asking the attendants the cause of her
apprehension,--for she was awaiting trial,--Joseph a Doloribus came, in
answer to his message, and was about to complain of the intrusion,
when he parried the complaint by asking for the letter from the chief
inquisitor.He promised to send it after him, and conducted him to the
door.As they passed the poor woman, the doctor pointed to her, and said
with emphasis, "Behold, father, another victim of the Holy Inquisition."The other answered nothing; they bowed, and separated without a word.Buchanan published his "Christian Researches in Asia," in the
year 1812, the Inquisition still existed at Goa; but the establishment
of constitutional government in Portugal, put an end to it throughout
the whole Portuguese dominions.APPENDIX V.

INQUISITION AT MACERATA, ITALY.I never pretended that it was for the sake of religion alone, that I
left Italy, On the contrary, I have often declared, that, had I never
belonged to the Inquisition, I should have gone on, as most Roman
Catholics do, without ever questioning the truth of the religion I was
brought up in, or thinking of any other.But the unheard of cruelties
of that hellish tribunal shocked me beyond all expression, and rendered
me,--as I was obliged, by my office of Counsellor, to be accessary to
them,--one of the most unhappy men upon earth.I therefore began
to think of resigning my office; but as I had on several occasions,
betrayed some weakness as they termed it, that is, some compassion and
humanity, and had upon that account been reprimanded by the Inquisitor,
I was well apprized that my resignation would be ascribed by him to
my disapproving the proceedings of the holy tribunal.And indeed, to
nothing else could it be ascribed, as a place at that board was a
sure way to preferment, and attended with great privileges, and a
considerable salary.Being, therefore, sensible how dangerous a thing it
would be to give the least ground for any suspicions of that nature,
and no longer able to bear the sight of the many barbarities practised
almost daily within those walls, nor the reproaches of my conscience for
being accessary to them, I determined, after many restless nights, and
much deliberation, to withdraw at the same time from the Inquisition,
and from Italy.In this mind, and in the most unhappy and tormenting
situation that can possibly be imagined, I continued near a
twelve-month, not able to prevail on myself to execute the resolution
I had taken on account of the many dangers which I foresaw would
inevitably attend it, and the dreadful consequences of my failing in
the attempt.But, being in the mean time ordered by the Inquisitor, to
apprehend a person with whom I had lived in the greatest intimacy and
friendship, the part I was obliged to act on that occasion, left so deep
an impression on my mind as soon prevailed over all my fears, and made
me determine to put into execution, at all events, and without delay,
the design I had formed.Of that transaction I shall give a particular
account, as it will show in a very strong light the nature and
proceedings of that horrid court.The person whom the Inquisitor appointed me to apprehend was Count
Vicenzo della Torre, descended from an illustrious family in Germany,
and possessed of a very considerable estate in the territory of
Macerata.He was one of my very particular friends, and had lately
married the daughter of Signior Constantini, of Fermo, a lady no less
famous for her good sense than her beauty.With her family too, I had
contracted an intimate acquaintance, while Professor of Rhetoric in
Fermo, and had often attended the Count during his courtship, from
Macerata to Fermo, but fifteen miles distant.I therefore lived with
both in the greatest friendship and intimacy; and the Count was the
only person that lived with me, after I was made Counsellor of the
Inquisition, upon the same free footing as he had done till that time.My other friends had grown shy of me, and gave me plainly to understand
that they no longer cared for my company.As this unhappy young gentleman was one day walking with another, he met
two Capuchin friars, and turning to his companion, when they had passed,
"what fools," said he, "are these, to think they shall gain heaven by
wearing sackcloth and going barefoot!Fools indeed, if they think so,
or that there is any merit in tormenting one's self; they might as well
live as we do, and they would get to heaven quite as soon."Who informed
against him, whether the friars, his companion, or somebody else, I
know not; for the inquisitors never tell the names of informers to the
Counsellors, nor the names of the witnesses, lest they should except
against them.It is to be observed, that all who hear any proposition
that appears to them repugnant to, or inconsistent with the doctrines of
holy mother church, are bound to reveal it to the Inquisitor, and also
to discover the person by whom it was uttered; and, in this affair no
regard is to be had to any ties, however sacred.The brother being bound
to accuse the brother, the father the son, the son the father, the wife
her husband, and the husband his wife; and all bound on pain of eternal
damnation, and of being treated as accomplices if they do not denounce
in a certain time; and no confessor can absolve a person who has heard
anything said in jest or in earnest, against the belief or practice
of the church, till that person has informed the Inquisitor of it, and
given him all the intelligence he can concerning the person by whom it
was spoken.Whoever it was that informed against my unhappy friend, whether the
friars, his companion, or somebody else who might have overheard him,
the Inquisitor acquainted the board one night, (for to be less observed,
they commonly meet, out of Rome, in the night) that the above mentioned
propositions had been advanced, and advanced gravely, at the sight of
two poor Capuchins; that the evidence was unexceptionable; and that
they were therefore met to determine the quality of the proposition, and
proceed against the delinquent.There are in each Inquisition twelve Counsellors, viz: four Divines,
four Canonists, and four Civilians.It is chiefly the province of the
divines to determine the quality of the proposition, whether it is
heretical, or only savors of heresy; whether it is blasphemous and
injurious to God and His saints or only erroneous, rash, schismatical,
or offensive to pious ears.The part of the proposition, "Fools!if
they think there is any merit in tormenting one's self," was judged and
declared heretical, as openly contradicting the doctrine and practice of
holy mother church recommending austerities as highly meritorious.The
Inquisitor observed, on this occasion, that by the proposition, "Fools
indeed" &c., were taxing with folly, not only the holy fathers, who had
all to a man practised great austerities, but St.Paul himself as the
Inquisitor understood it, adding that the practice of whipping one's
self, so much recommended by all the founders of religious orders, was
borrowed of the great apostle of the gentiles.The proposition being declared heretical, it was unanimously agreed by
the board that the person who had uttered it should be apprehended, and
proceeded against agreeably to the laws of the Inquisition.And now the
person was named; for, till it is determined whether the accused person
should or should not be apprehended, his name is kept concealed from
the counsellors, lest they should be biased, says the directory, in
his favor, or against him.For, in many instances, they keep up an
appearance of justice and equity, at the same time that, in truth, they
act in direct opposition to all the known laws of justice and equity.No words can express the concern and astonishment it gave me to hear,
on such an occasion, the name of a friend for whom I had the greatest
esteem and regard.The Inquisitor was apprised of it; and to give me an
opportunity of practising what he had so often recommended to me, viz.conquering nature with the assistance of grace, he appointed me to
apprehend the criminal, as he styled him, and to lodge him safe, before
daylight, in the prison of the holy inquisition.I offered to excuse
myself, but with the greatest submission, from being in any way
concerned in the execution of that order; an order, I said, which I
entirely approved of, but only wished it might be put in execution by
some other person; for your lordship knows, I said, the connection.But
the Inquisitor shocked at the word, said with a stern look and angry
tone of voice, "What!There is your guard," (pointing to the Sbirri or bailiffs in waiting)
"let the criminal be secured in St.Luke's cell," (one of the worst,)
"before three in the morning."He then withdrew, and as he passed me
said, "Thus, nature is conquered."I had betrayed some weakness or sense
of humanity, not long before, in fainting away while I attended the
torture of one who was racked with the utmost barbarity, and I had on
that occasion been reprimanded by the Inquisitor for suffering nature
to get the better of grace; it being an inexcusable weakness, as he
observed, to be in any degree affected with the suffering of the body,
however great, when afflicted, as they ever are in the Holy Inquisition,
for the good of the soul.And it was, I presume, to make trial of the
effect of that reprimand, that the execution of this cruel order was
committed to me.As I could by no possible means decline it, I summoned
all my resolution, after passing an hour by myself, I may say in the
agonies of death, and set out a little after two in the morning for my
unhappy friend's house, attended by a notary of the Inquisition, and six
armed Sbirri.We arrived at the house by different ways and knocking
at the door, a maid-servant looked out of the window, and asked who
knocked."The Holy Inquisition," was the answer, and at the same time
she was ordered to awake nobody, but to come down directly and open the
door, on pain of excommunication.At these words, the servant hastened
down, half naked as she was, and having with much ado, in her great
fright, opened the door, she conducted us as she was ordered to her
master's chamber.She often looked very earnestly at me, as she knew me,
and showed a great desire to speak with me; but of her I durst take no
kind of notice.I entered the bed-chamber with the notary, followed by
the Sbirri, when the lady awakening at the noise, and seeing the bed
surrounded by armed men, screamed out aloud and continued screaming as
out of her senses, till one of the Sbirri, provoked at the noise gave
her a blow on the forehead that made the blood flow, and she swooned
away.I rebuked the fellow severely, and ordered him to be whipped as
soon as I returned to the Inquisition.In the mean time, the husband awakening, and seeing me with my
attendants, cried out, in the utmost surprise, "MR.He said no
more, nor could I for some time utter a single word; and it was with
much ado that, in the end I so far mastered my grief as to be able
to let my unfortunate friend know that he was a prisoner of the Holy
Inquisition."Alas I what have I
done?He said many affecting things;
but as I knew it was not in my power to befriend him, I had not the
courage to look him in the face, but turning my back to him, withdrew,
while he dressed, to a corner of the room, to give vent to my grief.The
notary stood by, quite unaffected.Indeed, to be void of all humanity,
to be able to behold one's fellow-creatures groaning under the most
exquisite torments cruelty can invent, without being in the least
affected with their sufferings, is one of the chief qualifications of
an inquisitor, and what all who belong to the Inquisition must strive to
attain to.It often happens, at that infernal tribunal, that while the
unhappy, and probably innocent, person is crying out in their presence
on the rack, and begging by all that is sacred for one moment's relief,
in a manner one would think no human heart could withstand, it often
happens, I say, that the inquisitor and the rest of his infamous crew,
quite unaffected with his complaints, and deaf to his groans, to his
tears and entreaties, are entertaining one another with the news of the
town; nay, sometimes they even insult, with unheard of barbarity, the
unhappy wretches in the height of their torment.He was no sooner dressed than I
ordered the Bargello, or head of the Sbirri, to tie his hands with
a cord behind his back, as is practised on such occasions without
distinction of persons; no more regard being paid to men of the first
rank, when charged with heresy, than to the meanest offender.Heresy
dissolves all friendship; so that I durst no longer look upon the man
with whom I had lived in the greatest friendship and intimacy as my
friend, or show him, on that account, the least regard or indulgence.As we left the chamber, the countess, who had been conveyed out of the
room, met us, and screaming out in the most pitiful manner upon seeing
her husband with his hands tied behind his back like a thief or robber,
flew to embrace him, and hanging on his neck, begged, with a flood of
tears, we would be so merciful as to put an end to her life, that she
might have the satisfaction--the only satisfaction she wished for in
this world, of dying in the bosom of the man from whom she had vowed
never to part.The count, overwhelmed with grief, did not utter a single
word.I could not find it in my heart, nor was I in a condition to
interpose; and indeed a scene of greater distress was never beheld by
human eyes.However, I gave a signal to the notary to part them, which
he did accordingly, quite unconcerned; but the countess fell into a
swoon, and the count was meantime carried down stairs, and out of the
house, amid the loud lamentations and sighs of his servants, on all
sides, for he was a man remarkable for the sweetness of his temper, and
his kindness to all around him.Being arrived at the Inquisition, I consigned my prisoner into the
hands of a gaoler, a lay brother of St.Dominic, who shut him up in the
dungeon above-mentioned, and delivered the key to me.I lay that night
at the palace of the Inquisition, where every counsellor has a room, and
returned next morning the key to the inquisitor, telling him that his
order had been punctually complied with.The inquisitor had been already
informed of my conduct by the notary, and therefore, upon my delivering
the key to him, he said, "You have acted like one who is at least
desirous to overcome, with the assistance of grace, the inclinations of
nature;" that is, like one who is desirous, by the assistance of grace,
to metamorphose himself from a human creature into a brute or a devil.In the Inquisition, every prisoner is kept the first week of his
imprisonment in a dark narrow dungeon, so low that he cannot stand
upright in it, without seeing anybody but the gaoler, who brings him,
EVERY OTHER DAY, his portion of bread and water, the only food allowed
him.This is done, they say, to tame him, and render him, thus weakened,
more sensible of the torture, and less able to endure it.At the end of
the week, he is brought in the night before the board to be examined;
and on that occasion my poor friend appeared so altered, in a week's
time, that, had it not been for his dress, I should not have known him.And indeed no wonder; a change of condition so sudden and unexpected;
the unworthy and barbarous treatment he had already met with; the
apprehension of what he might and probably should suffer; and perhaps,
more than anything else, the distressed and forlorn condition of his
once happy wife, whom he tenderly loved, whose company he had enjoyed
only six months, could be attended with no other effect.Being asked, according to custom, whether he had any enemies, and
desired to name them, he answered, that he bore enmity to no man, and he
hoped no man bore enmity to him.For, as in the Inquisition the person
accused is not told of the charge brought against him, nor of the person
by whom it is brought, the inquisitor asks him if he has any enemies,
and desires him to name them.If he names the informer, all further
proceedings are stopped until the informer is examined anew; and if the
information is found to proceed from ill-will and no collateral proof
can be produced, the prisoner is discharged.Of this piece of justice
they frequently boast, at the same time that they admit, both as
informers and witnesses, persons of the most infamous characters,
and such as are excluded by all other courts.In the next place, the
prisoner is ordered to swear that he will declare the truth, and conceal
nothing from the holy tribunal, concerning himself or others, that he
knows and the holy tribunal desires to know.He is then interrogated for
what crime he has been apprehended and imprisoned by the Holy Court of
the Inquisition, of all courts the most equitable, the most cautious,
the most merciful.To that interrogatory the count answered, with a
faint and trembling voice, that he was not conscious to himself of any
crime, cognizable by the Holy Court, nor indeed by any other; that he
believed and ever had believed whatever holy mother church believed or
required him to believe.He had, it seems quite forgotten what he
had unthinkingly said at the sight of the two friars.The inquisitor,
therefore, finding that he did not remember or would not own his crime,
after many deceitful interrogatories, and promises which he never
intended to fulfil, ordered him back to his dungeon, and allowing him
another week, as is customary in such cases, to recollect himself, told
him that if he could not in that time prevail upon himself to declare
the truth, agreeably to his oath, means would be found of forcing it
from him; and he must expect no mercy.At the end of the week he was brought again before the infernal
tribunal; and being asked the same questions, returned the same answers,
adding, that if he had done or said anything amiss, unwittingly or
ignorantly, he was ready to own it, provided the least hint of it were
given him by any there present, which he entreated them most earnestly
to do.He often looked at me, and seemed to expect--which gave me such
concern as no words can express--that I should say something in his
favor.But I was not allowed to speak on this occasion, nor were any of
the counsellors; and had I been allowed to speak, I durst not have said
anything in his favor; the advocate appointed by the Inquisition, and
commonly styled, "The Devil's Advocate," being the only person that
is suffered to speak for the prisoner.The advocate belongs to the
Inquisition, receives a salary from the Inquisition, and is bound by an
oath to abandon the defence of the prisoner, if he undertakes it, or not
to undertake it, if he finds it cannot be defended agreeably to the laws
of the Holy Inquisition; go that the whole is mere sham and imposition.I have heard this advocate, on other occasions, allege something in
favor of the person accused; but on this occasion he declared that he
had nothing to offer in defence of the criminal.In the Inquisition, the person accused is always supposed guilty, unless
he has named the accuser among his enemies.And he is put to the torture
if he does not plead guilty, and own the crime that is laid to his
charge, without being so much as told what it is; whereas, in all other
courts, where tortures are used, the charge is declared to the party
accused before he is tortured; nor are they ever inflicted without
a credible evidence of his guilt.But in the Inquisition, a man is
frequently tortured upon the deposition of a person whose evidence would
be admitted in no other court, and in all cases without hearing the
charge.As my unfortunate friend continued to maintain his innocence,
not recollecting what he had said, he was, agreeably to the laws of
the Inquisition, put to the torture.He had scarcely borne it twenty
minutes, crying out the whole time, "Jesus Maria!"when his voice failed
him at once, and he fainted away.He was then supported, as he hung
by his arms, by two of the Sbirri, whose province it is to manage the
torture, till he returned to himself.He still continued to declare that
he could not recollect his having said or done anything contrary to the
Catholic faith, and earnestly begged they would let him know with what
he was charged, being ready to own it if it was true.The Inquisitor was then so gracious as to put him in mind of what he had
said on seeing the two Capuchins.The reason why they so long conceal
from the party accused the crime he is charged with, is, that if he
should be conscious to himself of his having ever said or done anything
contrary to the faith, which he is not charged with, he may discover
that too, imagining it to be the very crime he is accused of.After a
short pause, the poor gentleman owned that he had said something to that
purpose; but, as he had said it with no evil intention, he had never
more thought of it, from that time to the present.He added, but with a
voice so faint, as scarce could be heard, that for his rashness he was
willing to undergo what punishment soever the holy tribunal should,
think fit to impose on him; and he again fainted away.Being eased for
a while of his torment, and returned to himself, he was interrogated by
the promoter fiscal (whose business it is to accuse and to prosecute, as
neither the informer nor the witnesses, are ever to appear,) concerning
his intention.For in the Inquisition, it is not enough for the party
accused to confess the fact, he must declare whether his intention was
heretical or not; and many, to redeem themselves from the torments
they, can no longer endure, own their intention was heretical, though
it really was not.My poor friend often told us, he was ready to say
whatever he pleased, but as he never directly acknowledged his intention
to have been heretical, as is required by the rules of the court, he
was kept on the torture still, quite overcome with the violence of the
anguish, he was ready to expire.Being taken down, he was carried quite
senseless, back to his dungeon, and there, on the third day, death put
an end to his sufferings.The Inquisitor wrote a note to his widow, to
desire her to pray for the soul of her late husband, and warn her not
to complain of the holy Inquisition, as capable of any injustice or
cruelty.The estate was confiscated to the Inquisition, and a small
jointure allowed out of it to the widow.As they had only been
married six months, and some part of the fortune was not yet paid, the
inquisitor sent an order to the Constantini family, at Ferno, to pay the
holy office, and without delay, what they owed to the late Count Della
Torre.The effects of heretics are all ipso facto confiscated to the
Inquisition from the very day, not of their conviction, but of their
crime, so that all donations made after that time are void; and whatever
they may have given, is claimed by the Inquisition, into whatsoever
hands it may have passed; even the fortunes they have given to their
daughters in marriage, have been declared to belong to, and are claimed
by the Inquisition; nor can it be doubted, that the desire of those
confiscations is one great cause of the injustice and cruelty of that
court.The death of the unhappy Count Della Torre was soon publicly known; but
no man cared to speak of it, not even his nearest relations, nor so much
as to mention his name, lest anything should inadvertently escape them
that might be construed into a disapprobation of the proceedings of the
most holy tribunal; so great is the awe all men live in of that jealous
and merciless court.The deep impression that the death of my unhappy friend, the barbarous
and inhuman treatment he had met with, and the part I had been obliged
to act in so affecting a tragedy, made on my mind, got at once the
better of my fears, so that, forgetting in a manner the dangers I had
till then so much apprehended, I resolved, without further delay to put
in execution the design I had formed, of quitting the Inquisition, and
bidding forever adieu to Italy.To execute that design with some safety,
I proposed to beg leave to visit the Virgin of Loretto, but thirteen
miles distant, and to pass a week there; but in the mean time, to make
the best of my way out of the reach of the Inquisition.Having, therefore, after many conflicts with myself, asked leave to
visit the neighboring sanctuary, and obtained it, I set out on horseback
the very next morning, leaving, as I proposed to keep the horse, his
full value with the owner.I took the road to Loretto, but turned out
of it a short distance from Recanati, after a most violent struggle with
myself, the attempt appearing to me at that juncture, quite desperate
and impracticable; and the dreadful doom reserved for me should I
miscarry, presented itself to my mind in the strongest light.But the
reflection that I had it in my power to avoid being taken alive, and
a persuasion that a man in my situation might lawfully avoid it, when
every other means failed him, at the expense of his life, revived my
staggered resolution; and all my fears ceasing at once, I steered my
course, leaving Loretto behind me, to Rocca Contrada, to Fossonbrone, to
Calvi in the dukedom of Urbino, and from thence through the Romagna into
Bolognese, keeping the by-roads, and at a good distance from the cities
through which the high road passed.Thus I advanced very slowly, travelling in very bad roads, and often in
places where there was no road at all, to avoid, not only the cities,
and towns, but also the villages.In the mean time I seldom had any
other support but some coarse provisions, and a very small quantity
even, of them, that the poor shepherds, the countrymen or wood cleavers
I met in those unfrequented by-places, could spare me.My horse fared
not much better than myself; but, in choosing my sleeping-place I
consulted his convenience as much as my own, passing the night where I
found most shelter for myself, and most grass for him.In Italy there
are very few solitary farm-houses or cottages, the country people all
living together in villages; and I thought it far safer to lie where I
could be in any way sheltered, than to venture into any of them.Thus I
spent seventeen days before I got out of the ecclesiastical state; and
I very narrowly escaped being taken or murdered, on the very borders of
that state; it happened thus.I had passed two whole days without any kind of subsistence whatever,
meeting with no one in the by-roads that could supply me with any, and
fearing to come near any house, as I was not far from the borders of the
dominions of the Pope.I thought I should be able to hold out till I
got into the Modanese, where I believed I should be in less danger than
while I remained in the papal dominions.But finding myself, about noon
of the third day, extremely weak and ready to faint away, I came into
the high road that leads from Bologna to Florence, a few miles distant
from the former city, and alighted at a post house, that stood quite
by itself.Having asked the woman of the house whether she had any
victuals, and being told that she had, I went to open the door of the
only room in the house, (that being a place where gentlemen only stop
to change horses,) and saw to my great surprise, a placard pasted on it,
with a minute description of my whole person, sad a promise of a reward
of 900 crowns (about 200 pounds English money) for delivering me up
alive to the Inquisition, being a fugitive from that holy tribunal,
and of 600 crowns for my head.By the same placard, all persons were
forbidden, on pain of the greater excommunication, to receive or
harbor, entertain, conceal, or screen me, or to be in any way aiding, or
assisting me to make my escape.This greatly alarmed me, as the reader
may well imagine; but I was still more frightened, when entering the
room, I saw two fellows drinking there, who, fixing their eyes on me as
soon as I went in, continued looking at me very steadfastly.I strove,
by wiping my face and blowing my nose, and by looking out of the window,
to prevent their having a full view of my features.But, one of
them saying, "The gentleman seems afraid to be seen," I put up my
handkerchief, and turning to the fellow, said boldly, "What do you mean
you rascal?Look at me; am I afraid to be seen?"He said nothing, but
looking again steadfastly at me, and nodding his head, went out, and
his companion immediately followed him.I watched them, and seeing them,
with two or three more, in close conference, and no doubt consulting
whether they should apprehend me or not, I walked that moment into
the stable, mounted my horse unobserved by them, and while they were
deliberating in an orchard behind the house, rode off at full speed, and
in a few hours got into the Modanese, where I refreshed both with food
and rest, as I was there in no immediate danger, my horse and myself.I
was indeed surprised to find that those fellows did not pursue me, nor
can I in any other way account for it, but by supposing, what is not
improbable, that, as they were strangers as well as myself, and had all
the appearance of banditti or ruffians flying out of the dominions of
the Pope, the woman of the house did not care to trust them with her
horses.From the Modanese I continued my journey, more leisurely through
the Parmesan, the Milanese, and part of the Venetian territory, to
Chiavenna, subject to the Grisons, who abhor the very name of the
Inquisition, and are ever ready to receive and protect all who, flying
from it, take refuge, as many Italians do, in their dominions.Still
I carefully concealed who I was, and whence I came, for, though no
Inquisition prevails among the Swiss, yet the Pope's nuncio who resides
at Lucerne, (a popish canton through which I was to pass,) might have
persuaded the magistrate to stop me as an apostate and deserter from the
order.Having rested a few days at Chiavenna, I resumed my journey quite
refreshed, continuing it through the country of the Grisons, and the two
small cantons of Ury and Underwald, to the canton of Lucerne.There
I missed my way, as I was quite unacquainted with the country, and
discovering a city at a distance, was advancing to it, but slowly, as I
knew not where I was, when a countryman whom I met, informed me that the
city before me was Lucerne.Upon that intelligence, I turned out of the
road as soon as the countryman was out of sight, and that night I
passed with a good natured shepherd in his cottage, who supplied me with
sheep's milk, and my horse with plenty of grass.I set out early next
morning, making my way westward, as I knew that Berne lay west of
Lucerne.But, after a few miles, the country proved very mountainous,
and having travelled the whole day over mountains I was overtaken among
them by night.As I was looking out for a place where I might shelter
myself during the night, against the snow and rain, (for it both snowed
and rained,) I perceived a light at a distance, and making towards it,
I got into a kind of foot-path, but so narrow and rugged that I was
obliged to lead my horse, and feel my way with one foot, (having no
light to direct me,) before I durst move the other.Thus, with much
difficulty I reached the place where the light was, a poor little
cottage, and knocking at the door, was asked by a man within who I was,
and what I wanted?I answered that I was a stranger and had lost my way.exclaimed the man, "There is no way here to lose."I
then asked him what canton I was in?and upon his answering that I was
in the canton of Berne, I cried out transported with joy, "I thank God
that I am."The good man answered, "And so do I."I then told him who I
was, and that I was going to Berne but had quite lost myself by keeping
out of all the high roads, to avoid falling into the hands of those
who sought my destruction.He thereupon opened the door, received and
entertained me with all the hospitality his poverty would admit of;
regaled me with sour crout and some new laid eggs, the only provision
he had, and clean straw with a kind of rug for a bed, he having no other
for himself and wife.The good woman expressed as much good nature as
her husband, and said many kind things in the Swiss language, which
her husband interpreted to me in the Italian; for that language he well
understood, having learned it in his youth, while servant in a public
home on the borders of Italy, where both languages are spoken.I never
passed a more comfortable night; and no sooner did I begin to stir in
the morning, than the good man and his wife both came to know how
I rested; and, wishing they had been able to accommodate me better,
obliged me to breakfast on two eggs, which providence, they said, had
sent them for that purpose.I took leave of the wife, who seemed most
sincerely to wish me a good journey.As for the husband, he would by all
means attend me to the high road leading to Berne; which road he said
was but two miles distant from that place.But he insisted on my first
going back with him, to see the way I had come the night before; the
only way, he said, I could have possibly come from the neighboring
canton of Lucerne.I saw it, and shuddered at the danger I had escaped;
for I found I had walked and led my horse a good way along a very narrow
path on the brink of a very dangerous precipice.The man made so
many pertinent and pious remarks on the occasion, as both charmed and
surprised me.I no less admired his disinterestedness than his piety;
for, upon our parting, after he had attended me till I was out of all
danger of losing my way, I could by no means prevail upon him to accept
of any reward for his trouble.He had the satisfaction, he said, of
having relieved me in the greatest distress, which was in itself a
sufficient reward, and he wished for no other.Having at length got safe into French Flanders, I there repaired to the
college of the Scotch Jesuits at Douay, and discovering myself to the
rector, I acquainted him with the cause of my sudden departure from
Italy, and begged him to give notice of my arrival, as well as the
motives of my flight to Michael Angelo Tambuvini, general of the order,
and my very particular friend.The rector wrote as I desired him, to the general, and he, taking no
notice of my flight, in his answer, (for he could not disapprove, and
did not think it safe to approve of it,) ordered me to continue where I
was till further notice.I arrived at Douay early in May, and continued
there till the beginning of July, when the rector received a second
letter from the general, acquainting him that he had been commanded by
the congregation of the Inquisition, to order me, wherever I was, back
into Italy; to promise me, in their name, full pardon and forgiveness if
I obeyed, but if I did not obey, to treat me as an apostate.He added,
that the same order had been transmitted, soon after my flight, to
the nuncios at the different Roman Catholic courts; and he, therefore,
advised me to consult my own safety without further delay.Upon the receipt of the general's kind letter, the rector was of opinion
that I should repair by all means, and without loss of time, to England,
not only as the safest asylum I could fly to, in my present situation,
but as a place where I should soon recover my native language, and be
usefully employed, either there or in Scotland.The place being thus
agreed on, and it being at the same time settled between the rector and
me, that I should set out the very next morning, I solemnly promised, at
his request and desire, to take no kind of notice, after my arrival
in England, of his having been in any way privy to my flight, or the
general's letter to him.This promise I have faithfully and honorably
observed; and should have thought myself guilty of the blackest
ingratitude if I had not observed it, being sensible that, had it been
known at Rome, that, either the rector or general had been accessary to
my flight, THE INQUISITION WOULD HAVE RESENTED IT SEVERELY IN BOTH.For
although a Jesuit in France, in Flanders, or in Germany, is out of the
reach of the Inquisition, the general is not; and the high tribunal not
only have it in their power to punish the general himself, who resides
constantly at Rome, but may oblige him to inflict what punishment they
please on any of the order obnoxious to them.The rector went that very night out of town, and in his absence, but not
without his privity, I took one of the horses of the college, early
next morning, as if I were going for a change of air, being somewhat
indisposed, to pass a few days at Lisle; but steering a different
course, I reached Aire that night and Calais the next day.I was there
in no danger of being stopped and seized at the prosecution of the
Inquisition, a tribunal no less abhorred in France than in England.But being informed that the nuncios at the different courts had been
ordered, soon after my flight, to cause me to be apprehended in Roman
Catholic countries through which I must pass, as an apostate and
deserter from the order, I was under no small apprehension of being
discovered and apprehended as such even at Calais.No sooner, therefore,
did I alight at the Inn, than I went down to the quay, and there as I
was very little acquainted with the sea, and thought the passage much
shorter than it is, I endeavored to engage some fishermen to carry me
that very night, in one of their small vessels, over to England.This
alarmed the guards of the harbor, and I should have been certainly
apprehended as a person guilty, or suspected of some great crime,
fleeing from justice, had not Lord Baltimore, whom I had the good luck
to meet in the Inn, informed me of my danger, and pitying my condition,
attended me that moment, with all his company, to the port, and conveyed
me immediately on board his yacht.There I lay that night, leaving every
thing I had but the clothes on my back, in the Inn; and the next day his
Lordship set me ashore at Dover, from whence I came in the common stage
to London.In the year 1706, the Inquisition at Arragon was broken up by the French
troops, under the command of the Duke of Orleans.The Holy Inquisitors
were driven from their beautiful house, and in answer to their indignant
remonstrance were told that the king wanted the house to quarter his
troops in, and they were therefore compelled to leave it immediately.The doors of the prisons were then thrown open, and among the four
hundred prisoners who were set at liberty were sixty young women, very
beautiful in person, and clad in the richest attire.Anthony Gavin, formerly one of the Roman Catholic priests of Saragossa,
Spain, relates (in a book published by him after his conversion) that
when travelling in France he met one of those women in the inn at
Rotchfort; the son of the inn-keeper, formerly an officer in the French
army, having married her for her great beauty and superior intelligence.In accordance with his request, she freely related to him the incidents
of her prison life, from which we take the following extract:

"Early the next morning, Mary got up, and told me that nobody was up
yet in the house; and that she would show me the DRY PAN and the GRADUAL
FIRE, on condition that I should keep it a secret for her sake as well
as my own.This I promised, and she took me along with her, and showed
me a dark room with a thick iron door, and within it an oven and a large
brass pan upon it, with a cover of the same and a lock to it.The oven
was burning at the time, and I asked Mary for what purpose the pan was
there.Without giving me any answer, she took me by the hand and led
me to a large room, where she showed me a thick wheel, covered on both
sides with thick boards, and opening a little window in the center of
it, desired me to look with a candle on the inside of it, and I saw all
the circumference of the wheel set with SHARP RAZORS.After that she
showed me a PIT FULL OF SERPENTS AND TOADS.Then she said to me, 'Now,
my good mistress, I'll tell you the use of these things.The dry pan and
gradual fire are for those who oppose the holy father's will, and for
heretics.They are put naked and alive into the pan, and the cover of it
being locked up, the executioner begins to put in the oven a small fire,
and by degrees he augmenteth it, till the body is burned to ashes.The
second is designed for those who speak against the Pope and the holy
fathers.They are put within the wheel, and the door being locked, the
executioner turns the wheel till the person is dead.The third is for
those who contemn the images, and refuse to give the due respect and
veneration to ecclesiastical persons; for they are thrown alive into the
pit, and there they become the food of serpents and toads.'Then Mary
said to me that another day she would show me the torments for public
sinners and transgressors of the commandments of holy mother church;
but I, in deep amazement, desired her to show me no more places; for the
very thought of those three which I had seen, was enough to terrify me
to the heart.So we went to my room, and she charged me again to be very
obedient to all commands, for if I was not, I was sure to undergo the
torment of the dry pan."Llorente, the Spanish historian and secretary-general of the
Inquisition, relates the following incident: "A physician, Juan de
Salas, was accused of having used a profane expression, twelve months
before, in the heat of debate.He denied the accusation, and produced
several witnesses to prove his innocence.But Moriz, the inquisitor at
Valladolid, where the charge was laid, caused de Salas to be brought
into his presence in the torture-chamber, stripped to his shirt, and
laid on a LADDER or DONKEY, an instrument resembling a wooden trough,
just large enough to receive the body, with no bottom, but having a
bar or bars to placed that the body bent, by its own weight, into an
exquisitely painful position.His head was lower than his heels, and the
breathing, in consequence, became exceedingly difficult.The poor man,
so laid, was bound around the arms and legs with hempen cords, each of
them encircling the limb eleven times."During this part of the operation they admonished him to confess the
blasphemy; but he only answered that he had never spoken a sentence
of such a kind, and then, resigning himself to suffer, repeated the
Athanasian creed, and prayed to God and our Lady many times.Being
still bound, they raised his head, covered his face with a piece of fine
linen, and, forcing open the mouth, caused water to drip into it from an
earthen jar, slightly perforated at the bottom, producing in addition
to his sufferings from distension, a horrid sensation of choking.But
again, when they removed the jar for a moment, he declared that he had
never uttered such a sentence; and this he often repeated.They then
pulled the cords on his right leg, cutting into the flesh, replaced the
linen on his face, dropped the water as before, and tightened the cords
on his right leg the second time; but still he maintained that he
had never spoken such a thing; and in answer to the questions of his
tormentors, constantly reiterated that he HAD NEVER SPOKEN THOSE WORDS.Moriz then pronounced that the said torture should be regarded as
begun, but not finished; and De Salas was released, to live, if he could
survive, in the incessant apprehension that if he gave the slightest
umbrage to a familiar, he would be carried again into the same chamber,
and be RACKED IN EVERY LIMB."Llorente also relates, from the original records, another case quite as
cruel and unjust as the above."On the 8th day of December, 1528, one
Catalina, a woman of BAD CHARACTER, informed the inquisitors that,
EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE she had lived in the house with a Morisco named
Juan, by trade a coppersmith, and a native of Segovia; that she had
observed that neither he nor his children ate pork or drank wine, and
that, on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings they used to wash their
feet, which custom, as well as abstinence from pork and wine, was
peculiar to the Moors.The old man was at that time an inhabitant of
Benevente, and seventy-one years of age.But the inquisitors at once
summoned him into their presence, and questioned him at three several
interviews.All that he could tell was, that he received baptism when he
was forty-five years of age; that having never eaten pork or drunk wine,
he had no taste for them; and that, being coppersmiths, they found it
necessary to wash themselves thoroughly once a week.After some other
examinations, they sent him back to Benevente, with prohibition to go
beyond three leagues' distance from the town.Two years afterwards the
inquisitor determined that he should be threatened with torture, IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM TO CRIMINATE OTHERS.He was accordingly taken to Valladolid, and in a subterranean chamber,
called the 'chamber, or dungeon, of torment,' stripped naked, and bound
to the 'ladder.'This might well have extorted something like confession
from an old man of seventy-one; but he told them that whatever he might
say when under torture would be merely extorted by the extreme anguish,
and therefore unworthy of belief; that he would not, through fear of
pain, confess what had never taken place.They kept him in close prison
until the next Auto de Fe, when he walked among the penitents, with a
lighted candle in his hand, and, after seeing others burnt to death,
paid the holy office a fee of four ducats, and went home, not acquitted,
but released.He was not summoned again, as he died soon afterwards."It sometimes happened that an individual was arrested by mistake, and
a person who was entirely innocent was tortured instead of the real or
supposed criminal.Bower found related at length
in the "Annals of the Inquisition at Macerata.""An order was sent from the high tribunal at Rome to all the inquisitors
throughout Italy, enjoining them to apprehend a clergyman minutely
described in that order.One Answering the description in many
particulars being discovered in the diocese of Osimo, at a small
distance from Macerata, and subject to that Inquisition, he was there
decoyed into the holy office, and by an order from Rome SO RACKED AS TO
LOSE HIS SENSES.In the mean time, the true person being apprehended,
the unhappy wretch was dismissed, by a second order from Rome, but he
never recovered the use of his senses, NOR WAS ANY CARE TAKEN OF HIM BY
THE INQUISITION."It would be easy to fill a volume with such narratives as the above, but
we forbear.We are not writing a history of the Inquisition.We simply
wish to exhibit the true spirit by which the Romanists are actuated in
their dealings with those over whom they have power.We therefore, in
closing this chapter of horrors, beg leave to place before our readers
one of the FATHERLY BENEDICTIONS with which, His Holiness, the Pope,
dismisses his refractory subjects.Does it not show most convincingly
what he would do here in America, if he had, among us, the power he
formerly possessed in the old world, when the least inadvertent word
might perchance seal the doom of the culprit?A POPISH BULL OK CURSE."Pronounced on all who leave the Church of Rome.By the authority of God
Almighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin
Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all celestial virtues,
Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim,
and of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all the Apostles and
Evangelists, of the holy innocents, who in the sight of the holy Lamb
are found worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs and Holy
Confessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all the Saints, together
with the Holy Elect of God,--MAY HE BE DAMNED.We excommunicate and
anathematize him, from the threshold of the holy church of God Almighty.We sequester him, that he may be tormented, disposed, and be delivered
over with Datham and Abiram, and with those who say unto the Lord,
'Depart from us, we desire none of thy ways;' as a fire is quenched with
water, so let the light of him be put out forevermore, unless it shall
repent him, and make satisfaction."May the Father who creates man, curse him.May the Son, who suffered
for us, curse him!May the Holy Ghost who is poured out in baptism,
curse him!May the Holy Cross, which Christ for our salvation,
triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him!"May the Holy Mary, ever Virgin and Mother of God, curse him!May all
the Angels, Principalities, and Powers, and all heavenly Armies curse
him!May the glorious band of the Patriarchs and Prophets curse him!John the Precursor, and St John the Baptist, and St.Andrew and all other of Christ's Apostles together
curse him and may the rest of the Disciples and Evangelists who by their
preaching converted the universe, and the Holy and wonderful company
of Martyrs and Confessors, who by their works are found pleasing to God
Almighty; may the holy choir of the Holy Virgins, who for the honor of
God have despised the things of the world, damn him.May all the Saints
from the beginning of the world to everlasting ages, who are found to be
beloved of God, damn him!"May he be damned wherever he be, whether in the house or in the alley,
in the woods or in the water, or in the church!May he be cursed in
living or dying!"May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in being hungry, in being
thirsty, in fasting and sleeping, in slumbering, and in sitting, in
living, in working, in resting, and in blood letting!May he be cursed
in all the faculties of his body!"May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly.May he be cursed in his hair;
cursed be he in his brains, and his vertex, in his temples, in his
eyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
teeth, and grinders, in his lips, in his shoulders, in his arms, and in
his fingers."May he be damned in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart, and
purtenances, down to the very stomach!"May he be cursed in his reins and groins, in his thighs and his hips,
and in his knees, his legs and his feet, and his toe-nails!"May he be cursed in all his joints, and articulation of the members;
from the crown of the head to the soles of his feet, may there be no
soundness!"May the Son of the living God, with all the glory of his majesty, CURSE
HIM!And may Heaven, with all the powers that move therein, rise
up against him, and curse and damn him; unless he repent and make
satisfaction!Such was the CURSE pronounced on the Rev.Hogan, (a converted Roman
Catholic priest) a few years since, in Philadelphia.As a further proof of the cruel, persecuting spirit of Catholicism, let
us glance at a few extracts from their own publications."Children," they say, "are obliged to denounce their parents or
relations who are guilty of heresy; ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE
BURNT.They may refuse them all nourishment, and permit them to die
with hunger; or they may KILL THEM as enemies, who violate the rights of
humanity.--Escobar, Theolg."A man condemned by the Pope, may be killed wherever he is found.""Children may kill their parents, if they would turn their children
from the Popish faith.""If a judge decide contrary to law, the injured
person may defend himself by killing the judge."--Fangundez Precept
Decal, vol."To secretly kill your calumniator, to avoid scandal, is
justifiable.""You may kill before hand, any person who may put you to death,
not EXCEPTING THE JUDGE, AND WITNESSES, because it is
self-defence.""A priest may kill those who hinder him from taking possession of any
Ecclesiastical office.""You may charge your opponent with false crime to take away his credit,
as well as kill him."--Guimenius, prop, 8, p."Priests may kill the laity to preserve their goods.""You may kill any man to save a crown.""BY THE COMMAND OF GOD IT IS LAWFUL TO MURDER THE INNOCENT, TO ROB, AND
TO COMMIT ALL KIND OF WICKEDNESS, BECAUSE HE IS THE LORD OF LIFE
AND DEATH, AND ALL THINGS; AND THUS TO FULFILL HIS MANDATE IS OUR
DUTY."Again, in the Romish Creed found in the pocket of Priest Murphy, who was
killed in the battle of Arklow, 1798, we find the following articles."We acknowledge that the priests can make vice virtue, and virtue vice,
according to their pleasure."We are bound to believe that the holy massacre was lawful, and lawfully
put into execution, against Protestants, and likewise WE ARE TO CONTINUE
THE SAME, PROVIDED WITH SAFETY TO OUR LIVES!"We are bound not to keep our oaths with heretics, though bound by the
most sacred ties.We are bound not to believe their oaths; for their
principles are damnation.We are bound to drive heretics with fire,
sword, <DW19>, and confusion, out of the land; as our holy fathers say,
if their heresies prevail we will become their slaves.We are bound
to absolve without money or price, those who imbrue their hands in
the blood of a heretic!"Do not these extracts show very clearly that
Romanism can do things as bad as anything in the foregoing narrative?Whenever we refer to the relentless cruelties of the Romanists, we are
told, and that, too, by the influential, the intelligent, those who are
well-informed on other subjects, that "these horrid scenes transpired
only in the 'dark ages;'" that "the civilization and refinement of the
present age has so modified human society, so increased the milk of
human kindness, that even Rome would not dare, if indeed she had the
heart, to repeat the cruelties of by-gone days."For the honor of humanity we could hope that this opinion was correct;
but facts of recent date compel us to believe that it is as false as it
is ruinous to the best interests of our country and the souls of men.A few of these facts, gathered from unquestionable sources, and some of
them related by the actors and sufferers themselves, we place before the
reader.In November, 1854, Ubaldus Borzinski, a monk of the Brothers of Mercy,
addressed an earnest petition to the Pope, setting forth the shocking
immoralities practised in the convents of his order in Bohemia.He specifies nearly forty crimes, mostly perpetrated by priors and
subpriors, giving time, place, and other particulars, entreating the
Pope to interpose his power, and correct those horrible abuses.For sending this petition, he was thrown into a madhouse of the Brothers
of Mercy, at Prague, where he still languishes in dreary confinement,
though the only mark of insanity he ever showed was in imagining that
the Pope would interfere with the pleasures of the monks.This Ubaldus has a brother, like minded with himself, also a member of
the same misnamed order of monks, who has recently effected his escape
from durance vile.John Evangelist Borzinski was a physician in the convent of the Brothers
of Mercy at Prague.By the
study of the Psalms and Lessons from the New Testament, which make up
a considerable part of the Breviary used in cloisters, he was first
led into Protestant views.He had been for seventeen years resident in
different cloisters of his order, as sick-nurse, alms gatherer,
student, and physician, and knew the conventual life out and out.As he
testifies: "There was little of the fear of God, so far as I could
see, little of true piety; but abundance of hypocrisy, eye-service,
deception, abuse of the poor sick people in the hospitals, such love
and hatred as are common among the children of this world, and the most
shocking vices of every kind."He now felt disgust for the cloister life, and for the Romish religion,
and he sought, by the aid of divine grace, to attain to the new birth
through the Word of God.Speaking of his change of views to a Prussian
clergyman, he thus describes his conversion: "Look you, it was thus I
became a Protestant.I found a treasure in that dustheap, and went away
with it."He then thought
within himself, if these detached passages can give such light, what an
illumination he must receive if he could read and understand the whole
Bible.He did not, however, betray his dissatisfaction, but devoted himself
to his professional duties with greater diligence.He might still have
remained in the Order, his life hid with Christ in God, had not the
hierarchy, under pretence of making reforms and restoring the neglected
statutes of the Order, brought in such changes for the worse as led him
to resolve to leave the order, and the Romish church as well.Following
his convictions, and the advice of a faithful but very cautious
clergyman, he betook himself to the territories of Prussia, where, on
the 17th of January, 1855, he was received into the national church at
Petershain, by Dr.Nowotny, himself formerly a Bohemian priest.This was
not done till great efforts had been made to induce him to change his
purpose, and also to get his person into the power of his adversaries.As he had now left the church of Rome, become an openly acknowledged
member of another communion, he thought he might venture to return to
his own country.Taking leave of his Prussian friends, to whom he had
greatly endeared himself by his modesty and his lively faith, he went
back to Bohemia, with a heart full of peace and joy.He lived for some time amidst many perplexities, secluded in the house
of his parents at Prosnitz, till betrayed by some who dwelt in the same
habitation.On the 6th of March he was taken out of bed, at eight, by
the police, and conveyed first to the cloister in Prosnitz, where he
suffered much abuse, and from thence to the cloister in Prague.Here the
canon Dittrich, "Apostolical Convisitator of the Order of the Brothers
of Mercy," justified all the inhuman treatment he had suffered, and
threatened him with worse in case he refused to recant and repent.Dittrich not only deprived him of his medical books, but told him that
his going over to Protestantism was a greater crime than if he had
plundered the convent of two thousand florins.He was continually dinned
with the cry, "Retract, retract!"He was not allowed to see his brother,
confined in the same convent, nor other friends, and was so sequestered
in his cell as to make him feel that he was forgotten by all the world.He managed, through some monks who secretly sympathized with him, to get
a letter conveyed occasionally to Dr.These letters were filled
with painful details of the severities practised upon him.In one of
them he says, "My only converse is with God, and the gloomy walls around
me."He was transferred to a cell in the most unwholesome spot, and
infested with noisome smells not to be described.Close by him were
confined some poor maniacs, sunk below the irrational brutes.Under date of April 23d he writes: "Every hour, in this frightful
dungeon seems endless to me.For many weeks have I sat idle in this
durance, with no occupation but prayer and communion with God."His
appeals to civil authority and to the Primate of Hungary procured him no
redress, but only subjected him to additional annoyances and hardships.His aged father, a man of four-score years, wept to see him, though of
sound understanding, locked up among madmen; and when urged to make his
son recant, would have nothing to do with it, and returned the same
day to his sorrowful home.As he had been notified that he was to be
imprisoned for life, he prayed most earnestly to the Father of mercies
for deliverance; and he was heard, for his prayers and endeavors wrought
together.The sinking of his health increased his efforts to escape;
for, though he feared not to die, he could not bear the thought of dying
imprisoned in a mad-house, where he knew that his enemies would take
advantage of his mortal weakness to administer their sacraments to him,
and give out that he had returned to the bosom of the church, or at
least to shave his head, that he might be considered as an insane
person, and his renunciation of Romanism as the effect of derangement
of mind.Several plans of escape were projected, all beset with much
difficulty and danger.The one he decided upon proved to be successful.On Saturday, the 13th of October, at half-past nine in the evening, he
fastened a cord made of strips of linen to the grate of a window, which
grate did not extend to the top.Having climbed over this, he lowered
himself into a small court-yard.He had now left that part of the
establishment reserved for the insane, and was now in the cloistered
part where the brethren dwelt.He saw
at a distance a servant of the insane approaching with a light; and
with aching heart and trembling limbs, by a desperate effort, climbed
up again.He returned to his cell, concealing his cord, and laid himself
down to rest.On the following Monday, he renewed his efforts to escape.He lowered
himself, as before, into the little court-yard; but being weak in health
and much shaken in his nervous system by all he had suffered in body and
mind, he was seized with palpitation of the heart and trembled all over,
so that he could not walk a step.He laid down to rest and recover his
breath.He felt as if he could get no further."But," he says in his
affecting narrative, "My dear Saviour to whom I turned in this time of
need, helped me wonderfully.I felt now, more than ever in my life, His
gracious and comforting presence, and believed, in that dismal moment,
with my whole soul, His holy word;" "My grace is sufficient for thee;
for my strength is made perfect in weakness."Borzinski now arose, pulled off his boots, and though every step was
made with difficulty, he ascended the stairs leading to the first story.He went along the passage way until he came to a door leading into
corridors where the cloister brethren lodged.But the trembling fit came
over him again, with indescribable anguish, as he sought to open the
door with a key with which he had been furnished.He soon rallied again,
and, like a spectre, gliding by the doors of the brethren, who occupied
the second and third corridors, many of whom had lights still burning,
he came with his boots in one hand, and his bundle in the other, to
a fourth passage way, in which was an outside window he was trying to
reach.The cord was soon fastened to the window frame, yet still in
bitter apprehension; for this window was seldom opened, and opened
hard, and with some noise.It was also only two steps distant from the
apartment of the cloister physician, where there was a light, and it was
most likely that, on the first grating of the window, he would rush
out and apprehend the fugitive.However the window was opened without
raising any alarm, and now it was necessary to see that no one was
passing below; for though the spot is not very much frequented, yet
the streets cross there, and people approach it from four different
directions.During these critical moments, one person and another kept
passing, and poor Borzinski tarried shivering in the window for near a
quarter of an hour before he ventured to let himself down.While he
was waiting his opportunity he heard the clock strike the third quarter
after nine and knew that he had but fifteen minutes to reach the house
where he was to conceal himself, which would be closed at ten.When all
was still, he called most fervently on the Saviour, and grasping the
cord, slid down into the street.He could scarce believe his feet were
on the ground.Trembling now with joy and gratitude rather than fear, he
ran bareheaded to his place of refuge, where he received a glad welcome.Having changed his garb, and tarried till three o'clock in the morning,
he took leave of his friends and passing through the gloomy old capital
of Bohemia, he reached the Portzitscher Gate, in order to pass out
as early as possible.Just then a police corporal let in a wagon, and
Borzinski, passed out unchallenged.It is needless to follow him further
in his flight.We have given enough, of his history to prove that
conventual establishments are at this moment what they ever have
been--dangerous alike to liberty and life.AMERICAN AND FOREIGN
CHRISTIAN UNION.In place of labored arguments we give the following history of personal
suffering as strikingly illustrative of the spirit of Romanism at the
present day.APPENDIX VII

NARRATIVE OP SIGNORINA FLORIENCIA D' ROMANI, A NATIVE OF THE CITY OF
NAPLES.I was born in the year 1826, of noble and wealthy parents.Our mansion
contained a small chapel, with many images, sacred paintings, and a
neatly furnished mass altar.As he lived on the rents and income
of his estates, he had little to do, except to amuse himself with his
friends.My mother, who was of as mild and sweet disposition, loved my
father very dearly, but was very unhappy the most of the time because
my father spent so much of his time in drinking with his dissolute
companions, card playing, and in balls, parties, theatres, operas,
billiards, &c. Father did not intend to be unkind to my mother, for he
gave her many servants, and abundance of gold, horses, carriages and
grooms, and said frequently in my hearing, that his wife should be as
happy as a princess.Such was the state of society in Italy that men
thought their wives had no just reason to complain, so long as they were
furnished with plenty of food, raiment and shelter.One of my father's most intimate friends was the very Rev.Father
Salvator, a Priest of the order of St.Francis; he wore the habit of
the order, his head was about half shaved.The sleeves of his habit were
very large at the elbow; in these sleeves he had small pockets, in which
he usually carried his snuff box, handkerchief, and purse of gold.This
priest was merry, full of fun and frolic; he could dance, sing, play
cards, and tell admirably funny stories, such as would make even the
devils laugh in their chains.Such was the influence and power this Franciscan had over my father and
mother, that in our house, his word was law.He was our confessor, knew
the secrets and sins, and all the weak points of every mind in the whole
household.My own dear mother taught me to read before I was seven years
of age.As I was the only child, I was much petted and caressed, indeed,
such was my mother's affection for me that I was seldom a moment out of
her sight.There was a handsome mahogany confessional in our own chapel.When the priest wanted any member of the household to come to him to
confession, he wrote the name on a slate that hung outside the chapel
door, saying that he would hear confessions at such a time to-morrow.Thus, we would always have time for the full examination of our
consciences.Only one at a time was ever admitted into the chapel, for
confessional duty, and the priest always took care to lock the door
inside and place the key in his sleeve pocket.My mother and myself were
obliged to confess once a week; the household servants, generally once a
month.My father only once a year, during Lent, when all the inhabitants
of seven years, and upwards, are obliged to kneel down to the priests,
in the confessional, and receive the wafer God under the severest
penalties.Woe to the individual who resists the ecclesiastical mandate.When I was about fourteen years of age, I was sent to the Ursuline
Convent, to receive my education.My dear mother would have preferred
a governess or a competent teacher to teach me at home but her will was
but a mere straw in the hands of our confessor and priestly tyrant.It
was solely at the recommendation of the confessor, that I was imprisoned
four years in the Ursuline Convent.As my confessor was also the
confessor of the convent, he called himself my guardian and protector,
and recommended me to the special care of the Mother Abbess, and her
holy nuns, the teachers, who spent much of their time in the school
department.As my father paid a high price, quarterly, for my tuition
and board, I had a good room to myself, my living was of the best kind,
and I always had wine at dinner.The nuns, my teachers, took much more
pains to teach me the fear of the Pope, bishops and confessors, than
the fear of God, or the love of virtue.In fact, with the exception of a
little Latin and embroidery, which I learned in those four years, I came
out as ignorant as I was before, unless a little hypocrisy may be called
a useful accomplishment.For, of all human beings on earth, none can
teach hypocrisy so well as the Romish priests and nuns.In the school
department young ladies seldom have much to complain of, unless they are
charity scholars; in that case the poor girls have to put up with very
poor fare, and much hard work, hard usage and even heavy blows; how my
heart has ached for some of those unfortunate girls, who are treated
more like brutes, than human beings, because they are orphans, and poor.Yet they in justice are entitled to good treatment, for thousands of
scudi (dollars) are sent as donations to the convents for the support
of these orphans, every year, by benevolent individuals.So that as poor
and unfortunate as these girls are, they are a source of revenue to the
convents.For the first three years of my convent life, I passed the time in
the school department, without much anxiety of mind.I was gay and
thoughtless, my great trouble was to find something to amuse myself,
and kill time in some way.Though I treated all the school-mates with
kindness, and true Italian politeness, I became intimate with only one.She was a beautiful girl, from the dukedom of Tuscany.She made me her
confidant, and told me all her heart.Her parents were wealthy, and both
very strict members of the Romish Church.But she had an aunt in the
city of Geneva, who was a follower of John Calvin, or a member of the
Christian church of Switzerland.This aunt had been yearly a visitor at
her father's house.She being her father's only sister, an affectionate
intimacy was formed between the aunt and niece.The aunt, being a very
pious, amiable woman, felt it her duty to impress the mind of the niece,
with the superiority of the religion of the holy bible over popish
traditions; and the truth of the Scriptures soon found its way to the
heart of my young friend.But her confessor soon found out that some
change was going on in her mind, and told her father.There were
only two ways to save her soul from utter ruin; one was to give her
absolution and kill her before she got entirely out of the holy mother
church; the other, was to send her to the Ursuline convent at Naples,
where by the zeal and piety of those celebrated nuns, she might be
secured from further heresy.From this, the best friend of my school days, I learned more about God's
word, and virtue, and truth, and the value of the soul, than from all
other sources.There was a garden surrounded by a high wall, in which we
frequently walked, and whispered to each other, though we trembled all
the while for fear our confessor would by some means, find out that we
looked upon the Romish church as the Babylon destined to destruction,
plainly spoken of by St.My young friend stood in great fear of the priests; she trembled at the
very sight of one.Her aunt had read to her the history and sufferings of the persecuted
Protestants of Europe.She was a frail, and timid girl, yet such was the
depth of her piety and the fervor of her religious faith, that she often
declared to me that she would prefer death to the abandonment of those
heavenly principles she had embraced, which were the source of her
joy and hope.Her aunt gave her a pocket New Testament, in the Italian
language, which she prized above all the treasures of earth, and carried
with her carefully, wherever she went.I borrowed it and read it every
opportunity I had.I took much
pains to commit to memory all I could of the blessed book, for in
case of our separation, I knew not where I could obtain another.My
god-father who was a bishop, called to see me on my fifteenth birth day,
and presented me with a splendid gold watch and chain richly studded
with jewels, made in England, and valued at 200 scudi, saying that
he had it imported expressly for my use.I had also several diamond
articles of jewelry, presents I had received from my father from time to
time.I had also, in my purse, 100 scudi in gold, which I had saved from
my pin money.All the above property, I should have cheerfully given for
a copy of the Holy Bible, in my own beautiful Italian language.A few
months after I received the rich present from the Bishop, he called with
my father and my confessor to see me.My heart almost came into my mouth
when I saw them alight from my father's carriage, and enter the chapel
door of the convent.Very soon the lady porter came to me and said,
"Signorina, you are wanted in the parlor."As my Tuscan friend had taught me to pray, and ask the Lord Jesus for
grace and strength, I walked into my room, locked the door, and on my
knees, called upon the Lord to save me from becoming a nun--for I
knew then it was a determination on the part of the Abbess, bishop
and confessor, that I should take the veil.I was the only child, and
heiress of an immense fortune, of course, too good a prize to be lost.After a short and fervent prayer to my Lord and Saviour, I walked down
to see what was to be my doom.I kissed my father's cheek, and kissed
the hands of the Bishop and confessor--yet my very soul revolted
from the touch of these whited sepulchres.All received me with great
cordiality, yea, even more than usual affection.Soon after our meeting,
my father asked permission of the Bishop to speak to me privately and
taking me into a small room, said to me, "My dear daughter, you are not
aware of the great misfortune that has recently come upon your father.While I was excited with wine at the card-table last evening, betting
high and winning vast sums of money, I so far forgot myself and my duty
to the laws of the country, that I called for a toast, and induced
a number of my inebriated companions to drink the health of Italian
liberty, and we all drank and gave three cheers for liberty and a
liberal constitution.A Benedictine Friar being present, took all our
names to the Commissary General, and offered to be a witness against
us in the King's Court.As this is my first and only offence, the holy
Bishop your god-father offers on certain conditions, to visit Rome
immediately on my behalf, and secure the mediation of the holy Father
Pius IX.Your venerable god-father has great influence at Rome, being
a special favorite with his holiness, and his holiness can obtain any
favor he asks of King Ferdinand.So if you will only consent to take the
Black Veil, your father will be saved from the State prison."This was terrible news to my young and palpitating heart.It was the
first heavy blow that I had experienced in this vale of tears.I did not
speak for some minutes; I could not.My trembling bosom heaved like the
waves of the ocean before the blast.My veins were almost bursting; my
hands and feet became as cold as marble, and when I attempted to speak
my words seemed ready to choke me to death.I fell upon my knees and called upon God for mercy and help.My
father, thinking I had gone mad, was greatly alarmed.The Bishop
and confessor, who were anxiously waiting the result of my father's
proposition, hearing my father weep and sob aloud, came in to see what
the matter was.In the midst of my prayer, I fainted away, and became
entirely unconscious.When I came to myself, I found myself on the bed.As I opened my eyes, it all seemed like a dream.The abbess spoke to me
very kindly, and sprinkled my bed with holy water, and at the same time
laid a large bronze crucifix on my breast, saying that Satan must be
driven from my soul, for had it not been for the devil, I would have
leaped for joy, and not fainted when father mentioned the black veil."No," said the holy mother, "had it not been for the devil you would
rejoice to take the holy black veil blessed by the Holy Madonna and the
blessed saints Clara and Theresa.It is a holy privilege that very few
can enjoy on earth.Yea, my daughter, there can not be a greater sin
in the sight of the Madonna and the blessed saints, than to reject a
secluded life.Yea," said the crafty old nun, (who was thinking much
more about my gold, than my soul,) "I never knew a young lady who had
the offer of becoming a nun and rejected it, who ever came to a good
end.If they refuse, and marry, they generally die in child-bed with the
first child, or they will marry cruel husbands, who beat them and kill
them by inches.Therefore, dear daughter, let me most affectionately
warn you as you have had the honor of being selected by the holy Bishop
and our holy confessor to the high dignity and privilege of a professed
nun, of the order of St.Ursula, reject it not at your peril.Be
assured, heaven knows how to punish such rebellion."My head ached so violently at the time, and I was so feverish that I
begged the old woman to send for my mother, and to talk to me no more on
the subject of the black veil, but to drop it until some future time.In
my agony on account of the foul plot against my liberty, my virtue, and
my gold, I felt such a passion of rage come upon me, that had I absolute
power for the moment I would have cast every Abbess, Pope, Bishop and
Priest into the bottomless pit.May the Lord forgive me, but I would
have done it at that time with a good will.The greatest comfort I now
had was reading my Tuscan friend's New Testament, or hearing it read by
her when we had a chance to be by ourselves, which was not very often.In the evening of the same day of my illness, father and mother came to
see me, and Satan came also in the shape of the confessor; so that I
had not a moment alone with my dear parents.The confessor feared my
determined opposition to a convent's life, for he had previous to this,
several times in the confessional, dropped hints to me on the great
happiness, purity, serenity and joy of all holy nuns.But I always told
him I would not be a nun for the world.I should be so good, it would
kill me in a short time."No, no, father," said I, "I WILL NOT BE A
NUN."Father spoke to me again of his great misfortune--told me that his trial
would come on in a few days and that he was now at liberty on a
very heavy bail; that the Bishop was only waiting my answer to start
immediately for the holy city, and throw himself at the feet of the holy
Pope to procure father's unconditional pardon from the King.I said
"my dear father, how long will you be imprisoned if you do not get a
pardon?""From two to five years," he replied."My daughter, it is
my first offence, and I have witnesses to prove that the priest who
appeared against me, urged me to drink wine several times after I had
drank a large quantity, and was the direct cause of my saying what
I did."Now it all came to me, that the whole of it was a plot, a
Jesuitical trick, to get my father in the clutches of the law, and then
make a slave of me for life through my sympathy for my dear father.The vile priests knew that I loved my father most ardently; in fact, my
father and mother were the only two beings on earth that I did love.My
mother I loved most tenderly, but my affection for my father was of a
different kind.I loved him most violently, with all the ardor of my
soul.Mother seemed all the home to me; but father was to me all the
world beside.He would frequently
come home, and get me to go out into the garden and play with him,
just as though he was my brother.There we would swing, run, jump and
exercise in several healthy games, common in our climate.He never gave
me an unkind word or an unkind reproof.If I did say anything wrong, he
would take me to my mother and say, "Clara, here I bring you a prisoner,
let her be kept on bread and water till dinner time."Even when mother
had displeased him about some trifle, so that he had not a smile for
her, he always had a smile for his Flora.Even now, while I write, a
chill comes over my frame, while I think of that vile Popish plot.I
said to my father, "You shall not be imprisoned if I can prevent it; at
the same time I do not see any great gain, comfort or profit in having
your only daughter put in prison for life, without the hope of liberty
ever more, to save you from two years imprisonment."At these words, the eyes of the confessor flashed like lurid lightnings;
his very frame shook, as though he had the fever and ague.Truth seemed
so strange to the priest, that he found it hard of digestion.Father
and mother both wept, but made no reply.The idea of putting their only
child in a dungeon for life, though it might be done in the sacred name
of religion, did not seem to give them much comfort "Father," said I, "I
wish to see you at ten o'clock to-morrow morning, without fail--I wish
to see you alone; don't bring mother or any one else with you.You shall
not go to prison, all will yet be well."On account of this reasonable
request, to see my father alone, the confessor arose in a terrible rage
and left the apartment As quick as the mad priest left us to ourselves,
I told my father my plan, or what I would like to do with his
permission.My plan was, for my mother and myself to get into our
carriage and drive to the palace of King Ferdinand and make him
acquainted with all the truth; for I was aware from what I had heard,
that the King had heard only the priest's side of the story.My father
stood in such fear of the priests that he only consented to my plan with
great reluctance, saying that we ought first to make our plan known to
the confessor, lest he should be offended.To this my mother responded,
saying, "My daughter, it would be very wrong for us to go to the King,
or take any step without the advice of our spiritual guide."Here,
I felt it to be my duty to reveal to my deceived parents some of the
secrets of the confessional, though I might, in their estimation,
be guilty of an unpardonable sin by breaking the seal of iniquity.I
revealed to my parents the frequent efforts of the priest to obtain my
consent to take the veil, and that I had opposed from first to last,
every argument made use of to rob me of the society of my parents, of my
liberty, and of everything I held dear on earth.As to the happiness of
the nuns so much talked of by the priests, from what I had seen in their
daily walk and general deportment, I was fully convinced that there was
no reality in it; they were mere slaves to their superiors, and not half
so happy as the free slaves on a plantation who have a kind master.My
parents saw my determination to resist to the death every plan for my
imprisonment in the hateful nunnery.Therefore they promised that I
should have the opportunity to see the King on the morrow in company
with my mother.On the following day, at twelve o'clock, we left the convent in our
carriage for the palace.We were very politely received by the gentleman
usher, who conducted us to seats in the reception-room.After sending
our cards to the king, we waited nearly one hour before he made his
appearance.His majesty received us with much kindness, raised us
immediately from our knees, and demanded our business.I was greatly
embarrassed at first, but the frank and cordial manner of the sovereign
soon restored me to my equilibrium, and I spoke freely in behalf of my
dear father.The king heard me through very patiently, with apparent
interest, and said, "Signorina, I am inclined to believe you have spoken
the truth; and as your father has always been a good loyal subject, I
shall, for your sake, forgive him this offence; but let him beware that
henceforth, wine or no wine, he does not trespass against the laws
of the kingdom, for a second offence I will not pardon.Go in peace,
signoras, you have my royal word."We thanked his majesty, and returned to our home with the joyful
tidings.My father, who had been waiting the
result of our visit to the palace with great impatience, received us
with open arms, and pressed us to his heart again and again.I was so excited that, long before we got to him, I cried out, "All is
well, all is well, father.We drove
home, and father went immediately to spread the happy news amongst
his friends.All our faithful domestics, including my old affectionate
nurse, were so overjoyed at the news that they danced about like
maniacs.My father was always a very indulgent and liberal master,
furnished his servants with the best of Italian fare, plenty of
fresh beef, wine, and macaroni.We had scarcely got rested, when our
tormenter, the confessor, came into our room and said, "Signoras, what
is the meaning of all this fandango and folly amongst the servants?ARE
THE HERETICS ALL KILLED, that there should be such joy, or has the queen
been delivered of a son, an heir to the throne?"My dear mother was now as pale as death, and silent, for she saw that
the priest was awfully enraged; for, although he feigned to smile, his
smile was similar to that of the hyena when digging his prey out of
the grave.The priest's dark and villainous visage had the effect of
confirming in my mother's mind all the truth regarding the plot to
enslave me for life, and secure all my father's estate to the pockets
of the priests.The confessor was now terribly mad, for two obvious
reasons: one was because he was not received by us with our usual
cordiality and blind affection; the other, because, by the king's
pardon, I was not under the necessity to sacrifice my liberty and
happiness for life to save my father from prison; and what tormented him
the most was, that he believed that I, though young, could understand
and thwart his hellish plans.As my mother trembled and was silent,
fearing the priest was cursing her and her only daughter in his
heart,--for the priests tell such awful stories about the effects of a
priest's curse that the great mass of the Italian people fear it more
than the plague or any earthly misfortune.Peter is the doorkeeper of the great
city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, that he has the keys of the kingdom
of heaven, and has received strict orders not to admit any soul, under
any circumstances, who has been cursed by a holy priest, unless that
curse has been removed by the same priest in the tribunal of penance.I
was obliged to speak to his reverence, and I felt so free, so happy in
Christ as my only hope, that I opened my mind to the priest very freely,
and told him what I thought of him and his plot."Sir priest," said I,
"I shall never return to the convent to stay long.As soon as the time
for my education ends, I shall return to liberty and domestic life.I
am not made of the proper material to make a nun of.I love the social
domestic circle; I love my father and mother, and all our domestics,
even the dogs and the cats, pigeons, and canaries, the fish-ponds,
play-grounds, gardens, rivers, and landscapes, mountain and ocean,--all
the works of God I love.I shall live out of the convent to enjoy these
things; therefore, reverend sir, if you value my peace and good-will,
never speak to me or my parents on the subject of my becoming a nun in
any convent.I shall prefer death to the loss of my personal liberty."I was so decided, and had received such strength and grace from heaven,
that the priest was dumbfounded,--my smooth stone out of the sling
had hit him in the right place.After much effort to appear bland and
good-natured, he drew near my chair, seized my hand, and said, "My dear
daughter, you mistake me.I love you as a daughter, I wish only your
happiness.Your god-father, the holy Bishop, does not intend that you
shall remain a common nun more than a year.After the first year you
shall be raised to the highest dignity in the convent.You shall be the
Lady Superior, and all the nuns shall bow at your feet, and implicitly
obey your commands.Clara is now very old, and his lordship wishes
soon to fill her place.For that purpose he has selected his adopted
daughter.Your talents, education, wealth, and high position in society,
eminently fit you for one of the highest dignities on earth.""A thousand thanks for the kindness of my lord Bishop," said I; "but
your reverence has not altered my mind in the least.I can never bow
down to the feet of any Lady Superior, neither will I ever consent to
see a single human being degraded at my feet.The holy Bible says, 'Thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.'"exclaimed the priest, "Where did you see that dangerous
book?Know you not that his holiness the Pope has placed it in the
Index Expurgatorius, because it has been the means of the damnation of
millions of souls?Not because it is in itself a bad book, but because
it is a theological work, prepared only for the priests and ministers of
our holy religion.Therefore, it is always a very dangerous book in
the hands of women or laymen, who wrest the Scriptures to their own
destruction.""Well, reverend sir," I replied, "you seem determined to differ from the
Lord Jesus and his apostles.I read in the New Testament that we should
search the Scriptures because they testify of Christ.And one of the
apostles, I don't remember which, said, 'all scripture is given by the
inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine and for instruction
in righteousness.'Now, reverend sir, if the people have souls, as well
as the priests, why should they not read the word of God which speaks of
Christ and is profitable for instruction?"exclaimed the priest, "and you talk very
much like one."His countenance changed to a pale sickly hue, as he
said, "My daughter, where did you get that dangerous book?If you have,
it in your possession, give it to me, and I will bless you, and pray for
you to the blessed Madonna that she may save you from the infernal pit
of heresy.""I do not own the blessed book," said I, "but I wish I did.I would give
one hundred scudi in gold for a copy of the New Testament.I borrowed a
copy from a friend, and returned it to the owner again.But I understand
that there are copies to be had in London, and when I have a good
opportunity I shall send for a copy, if I can do it unbeknown to any
one.""I shall be in the tribunal of
penance at six o'clock P.M.You need
pardon immediately, and spiritual advice.Should you die as you now are
without absolution, you would be lost and damned forever.I tremble for
you, my dear daughter, seeing that the devil has got such a powerful
hold of you.It may even be absolutely necessary to kill the body to
save your soul; for should you relapse again into heresy after due
penance for this crime has been performed, it would be impossible to
renew you again to repentance, seeing you crucify the Lord and the
Madonna afresh, and put them to an open shame."Here my mother fainted and shook like an aspen leaf.But God gave me
strength, and I said in a moment that as his reverence thought my sins
so great, I would not go to any man, no, not even to the Pope; I
would go to God alone, and leave my cause in his hands, life or death."Therefore, reverend sir, I shall save you from all further trouble in
attending the confessional any more on my account.From henceforth no
earthly power shall drag me alive and with my consent to the tribunal of
penance."exclaimed the priest furiously, "are you mad?There are ten
thousand devils in you, and we must drive them out by some means."After
this discharge of priestly venom, the priest left in a rage giving the
door a terrible slam, which awoke my mother from her sorrowful trance.During the whole conversation, such was the electrical power of the
priest over my mother's weak and nervous system, that if she attempted
to say a word in my behalf, the keen, snakish black eye of the priest
would at once make her tremble and quail before him, and the half
uttered word would remain silent on her lips.The priest went at once
in search of my father.He came home boiling over with rage, saying he
wished I had never been born.The
cause of all this paternal fury upon my poor devoted head was the foul
misrepresentations of my father confessor, who was now in league with
the Bishop, both determined to shut me up in a prison convent, or end my
mortal career.My poor mother remained mute and heart-broken.My sweet mother; never
did she utter one word of unkindness to me; her very look to the last
was one of gentleness and love.But my father loved honor and reputation
amongst men above all other things.The idea of being the father of an
accursed heretic, tormented his pride, and he being suspected of heresy
himself caused him to be forsaken by many of his proud friends and
acquaintances.He was even insulted in the streets by the numerous
Lazaroni, with the epithet of Maldito Corrobonari, so that I lost my
father's love.And when the confessor told him there was no other way
to save me from hell than an entire life of penance in a convent, he
heartily and freely gave his consent.Mother, my own sweet mother, my
only remaining friend, turned as pale as death, but was enabled to say a
word in my behalf.I saw that my earthly doom was sealed; there was not a single voice in
all Naples to save me from imprisonment for life.Not a tongue in four
hundred thousand that would dare speak one word in my behalf.Father
commanded me to get ready to leave his house forever that very night,
saying the carriage and confessor would be on hand to take me away at
eight o'clock P.M., by moonlight.I got on my knees and begged my father
as a last request that he would allow me to remain three days with my
mother, but he refused.Said he, "That is now beyond my power.Not an
hour can you remain after eight o'clock."As I knew not when I should see my Tuscan friend again, I begged the
privilege of seeing her for a few moments.I was anxious to ask her
prayers and sympathy, and to put her on her guard, for should the
priests discover her New Testament, they would punish her as they did
me, or as they intended to do to me.But this favor was denied me, and I
could not write to her, for all letters of the scholars in the
convents, are opened under the pretence to prevent them from receiving
love-letters.The Romish church keeps all her dark plans a secret, but
never allows any secret to be kept from the priests.I went into my room to bid farewell to my home forever.I fell on my
knees and prayed to God for his dear Son's sake to help me, to give me
patience, and to keep me from the sin of suicide.The more I thought
of my utterly unprotected situation and of the savage disposition of my
foes, the priests, the more I thought of the propriety of taking my own
life, rather than live in a dungeon all my days.Such was the power of
superstition over our domestics that they looked upon me as one accursed
of the church, a Protestant heretic, and not one of them would take my
hand or bid me good bye.At tea-time I was not allowed to sit at table
with father, mother, and the confessor, as formerly.But I had my supper
sent up to my room.A short time after the bell rang for vespers, the carriage being ready,
my father and the confessor with myself and one small trunk got into the
best seats inside, and rode off at a rapid rate.I kept my veil over my
face, and said not a word neither did I shed a single tear; my sorrow,
and indignation was too deep for utterance or even for tears.The priest
and my father uttered not a word.Perhaps my father's conscience
made him ashamed of such vile work--that of laying violent hands on a
defenceless girl of eighteen years of age, for no crime whatever, only
the love of liberty and pure Bible religion.But if the priest was
silent, his vile countenance indicated a degree of hellish pleasure and
satisfaction.Never did piratical captain glory more in seeing a rich
prize along side with all hands killed and out of the way, than my
reverend confessor; yet a short time before he said he loved me as a
daughter.Yes, he did love me, as the wolf loves the lamb, as the cat
loves the mouse and as the boa constrictor the beautiful gazelle.To
my momentary satisfaction we entered the big gate of St.Ursula, for
although I knew I should suffer there perhaps even death, there was some
satisfaction in seeing a few faces that I had seen in my gay and happy
days, now alas!I was somewhat grieved by the cold
reception I received.But none
of these things moved me; I looked to God for strength, for I felt that
He alone could nerve me for the conflict.The hardest blow of all was,
my dear father left me at the mercy of the priest without one kind look
or word.He did not even shake hands with me, nor did he say farewell.Oh Popery, what a mysterious power is thine!Thou canst in a few hours
destroy powerful love which it took long years to cement in loving
hearts.When my father had left and I heard the porter lock the heavy
iron gate I felt an exquisite wretchedness come over me.I would have
given worlds for death at that moment.In a few moments the priest rung
a bell, and the old Jezebel the mother Abbess made her appearance."Take
this heretic, Holy Mother, and place her in confinement in the lower
regions; GIVE HER BREAD AND WATER ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, THE WATER
THAT YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR SACRED FEET IN, NO OTHER; give her straw
to sleep on, but no pillow.Take all her clothing away and give her a
coarse tunic; one single coarse garment to cover her nakedness, but no
shoes.She has grievously sinned against the holy mother church, and now
she mercifully imposes upon her years of severe penance, that her body
of sin may be destroyed and her soul saved after suffering one million
of years in holy purgatory.Our chief duty now, holy mother, in order
to save this lost soul from mortal sin will be to examine her carefully
every, day to ascertain if possible what she most dislikes, or what
is most revolting to her flesh, that whatever it may be, she, must be
compelled to perform it whatever it may cost.Let a holy wax candle burn
in her cell at night, until further orders.And let the Tuscan heretic
be treated in the same way.At
the word "Tuscan heretic," possessing the spirit of Christ that I knew
on earth.Yet how true it is that misery loves company; there was even
satisfaction in being near my unfortunate friend though our sufferings
might be unutterable.Still I was unhappy in the thought that she was
suffering on my account.Had I never said a word about borrowing a New
Testament, she would never have been suspected as being the direct
cause of my conversion to the truth, and of my renunciation of the vile
confessional.I was somewhat puzzled to know what kind of a place was meant by the
lower regions; I had never heard of these regions before.But soon two
women in black habits with their faces entirely covered excepting
two small holes for the eyes to peep through, came to me and without
speaking, made signs for me to follow them.I did so without resistance,
and soon found myself in an under-ground story of the infernal building."There is your cell," said the cowled inquisitors, "look all around, see
every thing, but speak not; no not for your life.The softest whisper
will immediately reach the ears of the Mother Abbess, and then you are
loaded with heavy chains until you die, for there must be no talking
or whispering in this holy retreat of penance.And," said my jailor
further, "take off your clothes, shoes and stockings, and put on this
holy coarse garment which will chafe thy flesh but will bless thy soul.Francis saved many souls by this holy garment."As resistance was worse than useless, I complied, and soon found my poor
feet aching with the cold on the bare stone floor.I was soon made to
feel the blessing of St.My sufferings were
indescribable.It seemed as though ten thousand bees had stung me in
every part.I laid on my
coarse straw and groaned and sighed for death to come and relieve me of
my anguish.As soon as the holy wax candle was left with me I took it
in my hand and went forth to survey my dungeon; but I did not enjoy
my ramble.In one of the cells, I found my Tuscan friend--that dear
Christian sister--in great agony, having had on the accursed garment for
several days.Her body was one entire blister, and very much inflamed.Her bones were racked with pain, as with the most excruciating
inflammatory rheumatism.We recognized each other; she pointed to heaven
as if to say 'trust in the Lord, my sister, our sufferings will soon
be over.'I kissed my hand to her and returned again to my cell.I
saw other victims half dead and emaciated that made my heart sick.I
refrained from speaking to any one for I feared my condition, wretched
as it was, might be rendered even worse, if possible by the fiends who
had entire power over me.said I to myself, "why was I born?O give my soul patience to suffer every pain."On the fourth day of my imprisonment the jailor brought me some water
and soap, a towel, brush and comb, and the same clothes I wore when I
entered the foul den.They told me to make haste and prepare myself to
appear before the holy Bishop.Hope revived in my soul, for I always
thought that my god-father had some regard for me, and had now come to
release me from the foul den I was in.Cold water seemed to afford much
relief to my tortured body.I made my toilet as quick as I could in such
a place.My feet were so numb and swollen that it was difficult for me
to get my shoes on.At last the Bishop arrived as I supposed, and I
was conducted--not into his presence as I expected, but into that of
my bitterest enemy, the confessor.At the very sight of the monster, I
trembled like a reed shaken by the wind.The priest walked to each of
the doors, locked them, put the keys into a small writing desk, locked
it, took out the key and placed it carefully in his sleeve pocket.This
he did to assure me that we were alone, that not one of the inmates
could by any means disturb for the present the holy meditations of the
priest.He bade me take a seat on the sofa by him.In kind soft words he
said to me, that if I was only docile and obedient, he would cause me
to be treated like a princess, and that in a short time I should have
my liberty if I preferred to return to the world.At the same time he
attempted to put his arm around my waist.While he was talking love to me, I was looking at two large alabaster
vases full of beautiful wax flowers; one of them was as much as I could
lift.Without one thought about consequences, I seized the nearest vase
and threw it with all the strength I had at the priest's head.He fell
like a log and uttered one or two groans.It
struck the priest on the right temple, close to the ear.For a moment I
listened to see if any one were coming.I then looked at the priest, and
saw the blood running out of his wound.I quaked with fear lest I had
killed the destroyer of my peace.I did not intend to kill him, I only
wished to stun him, that I might take the keys, open the door and run,
for the back door of the priest's room led right into a back path where
the gates were frequently opened daring the day time.This was about
twelve o'clock, and a most favorable moment for me to escape.In a
moment I had searched the sleeve pocket of the priest, found the key and
a heavy purse of gold which I secured in my dress pocket.I opened the
little writing desk and took out the key to the back door.I saw that
the priest was not dead, and I had not the least doubt from appearances,
but that he would soon come to.I trembled for fear he might wake before
I could get away.I thought of my dear Tuscan sister in her wretched
cell, but I could not get to her without being discovered.I opened the door with the greatest facility and gained
the opening into the back path.I locked the door after me, and brought
the key with me for a short distance, then placed all the keys tinder
a rock.I had no hat but only a black veil.I threw that over my head
after the fashion of Italy and gained the outer gate.There were masons
at work near the gate which was open and I passed through into the
street without being questioned by any one.As I had not a nun's dress on, no one supposed I belonged to the
Institution.I could speak a
few English words which I had learned from some English friends of my
father.Before I got to where the boats lay I saw a gentleman whom I
took to be an English or American gentleman.He had a pleasant face,
looked at me very kindly, saw my pale dejected face and at once felt a
deep sympathy for me.As I appeared to be in trouble and needed help,
he extended his hand to me and said in tolerable good Italian, "Como va'
le' signorina?"that is "How do you do young lady?""Me," said he, "Americano, Americano, capitano de
Bastimento.""Signor Capitano," said I,
"I wish to go on board your ship and see an American ship.""Well," said
he, "with a great deal of pleasure; my ship lies at anchor, my men are
waiting; you shall dine with me, Signorina."I praised God in my soul for this merciful providence of meeting a
friend, though a stranger, whose face seemed to me so honest and so
true.Any condition, even honest slavery, would have been preferred by
me at that time to a convent.The American ship was the most
beautiful thing I ever saw afloat; splendid and neat in all her cabin
arrangements.The mates were polite, and the sailors appeared neat and
happy.Even the black cook showed his beautiful white teeth, as though
he was glad to see one of the ladies of Italy.Little did
they know at that time what peril I was in should I be found out and
taken back to my dungeon again.I informed the captain of my situation,
of having just escaped from a convent into which I had been forced
against my will.I told him I would pay him my passage to America, if
he would hide me somewhere until the ship was well out to sea.He said
I had come just in time, for he was only waiting for a fair wind, and
hoped to be off that evening."I have," said he, "a large number of
bread-casks on board, and two are empty.I shall have you put into one
of these, in which I shall make augur-holes, so that you can have plenty
of fresh air.Down in the hold amongst the provisions you will be safe."I thanked my kind friend and requested him to buy me some needles, silk,
and cotton thread, and some stuff for a couple of dresses, and one-piece
of fine cotton, so that I might make myself comfortable during the
voyage.After I ate my dinner, the men called the captain and said there were
several boats full of soldiers coming to the ship, accompanied by the
priests."Lady," exclaimed the captain, "they are after you.There is
not a moment to be lost.Smith, tell
the men to be careful and not make known that there is a lady on board."I followed my friend quickly, and soon
found myself coiled in a large cask.The captain coopered the head,
which was missing, and made holes for me to get the air; but the
perspiration ran off my face in a stream.Lots of things were piled on
the cask, so that I had hard work to breathe; but such was my fear
of the priests that I would rather have perished in the cask than be
returned to die by inches.The captain had been gone but a short time when I heard steps on deck,
and much noise and confusion.As the hatches were open, I could hear
very distinctly.After the whole company were on deck, the captain
invited the priests and friars, about twenty in number, to walk down to
the cabin, and explain the cause of their visit.They talked through an
interpreter, and said that "a woman of bad character had robbed one of
the churches of a large amount of gold, had attempted to murder one
of the holy priests, but they were happy to say that the holy father,
though badly wounded, was in a fair way of recovery.This woman is
young, but very desperate, has awful raving fits, and has recently
escaped from a lunatic institution.When her fits of madness come on
they are obliged to put her into a straight jacket, for she is the most
dangerous person in Italy.A great reward is offered for her by her
father and the government--five thousand scudi.Is not this enough to
tempt one to help find her?She was seen coming towards the shipping,
and we want the privilege of searching your ship.""Gentlemen," said the captain, "I do not know that the Italian
authorities have any right to search an American ship, under the stars
and stripes of the United States, for we do not allow even the greatest
naval power on earth to do that thing.But if such a mad and dangerous
woman as you have described should by any means have smuggled herself
on board my ship, you are quite welcome to take her away as soon as
possible, for I should be afraid of my life if I was within one hundred
yards of such an unfortunate creature.If you can get her into your
lunatic asylum, the quicker the better; and the five thousand scudi will
come in good time, for I am thinking of building me a larger ship on my
return home.Now, gentlemen, come; I will assist you, for I should like
to see the gold in my pocket."The captain opened all his closets and
secret places, in the cabin and forecastle and in the hold; everything
was searched, all but the identical bread-cask in which I was snugly
coiled.After something like half an hour's search, the soldiers of King
Ferdinand and the priests of King Pope left the ship, satisfied that the
crazy nun was not on board; for, judging the captain by themselves, they
thought he certainly would have given up a mad woman for the sake of
five thousand scudi in gold, and for the safety of his own peace and
comfort.A few moments after the Pope's friends had left, the excellent
benevolent captain came down, and speedily and gently knocking off a
few hoops with a hammer, took the head out, and I was free once more
to breathe God's free air.I lifted my trembling heart in thanksgiving,
while tears of gratitude rolled down my cheeks.Yet, as we were still
within the reach of the guns of the papal forts, my heart was by no
means at rest.But the good captain assured me repeatedly that
all danger was past, for he had twenty-five men on board, all true
Protestants, and he declared that all the priests of Naples would walk
over their dead bodies before they should reach his vessel a second
time."And besides," said the captain, "there are two American
men-of-war in port, who will stand up for the rights of Americans.They
have not yet forgotten Captain Ingraham, of the United States ship
St.Louis, and his rescue from the Austrian <DW7>s of the Hungarian
patriot, Martin Kozsta."The captain wisely refused to purchase any
needles or thread for me on shore, or any articles of ladies' dress,
for fear of the Jesuitical spies, who might surmise something and cause
further trouble.But he kindly furnished me with some goods he had
purchased for his own wife, and there were needles and silk enough on
board, so that I soon cut and made a few articles that made me very
comfortable during our voyage of thirty-two days to London.Early the next morning we sailed out of the beautiful harbor of Naples,
with a fair wind.The beautiful ship seemed to fly over the blue sea.I staid on deck gazing at my native city as long as I could.I thought
then of my once happy home, of my poor, broken-hearted mother, of my
unhappy father.Although he had cast me off through the foul play of
Jesuitical intrigue, my love for my dear father remained the same."Farewell, my dear Italy," I said to myself."When, my poor native land,
wilt thou be happy?Never, never, so long as the Pope lives, and his
wicked, murderous priests, to curse thee by their power."After we got out into the open sea, the motion of the ship made me feel
very sick, and I was so starved out before I came on board, that what
good provisions I ate on board did not seem to agree with me.My stomach
was in a very bad state, for while I was in the lower regions of the
convent I ate only a small quantity of very stale hard bread once in
twenty-four hours, at the ringing of the vesper bells every evening, and
the water given me was that in which the holy Mother Abbess had washed
her sacred feet.But I must give the holy mother credit for one good
omission--she did not use any soap.The captain gave me a good state-room which I occupied with an English
lady passenger.This good lady was accustomed to the sea, therefore, she
did not suffer any inconvenience from sea-sickness; but I was very sick,
so that I kept my berth for five days.This good Protestant lady was
very kind and attentive during the whole passage, and kindly assisted me
in getting my garments made up on board.On our arrival in London, the
captain said that he would sail for America in two weeks time, and very
kindly offered me a free passage to his happy, native land; and I could
not persuade him to take any money for my passage from Naples, nor for
the clothing he had given me.My fellow passenger being wealthy, and well acquainted with people in
England, took me to her splendid home, a few miles from London.At her
residence I was introduced to a young French gentleman, a member of the
Evangelical protestant church in France, and a descendant of the pious
persecuted Huguenots.This gentleman speaks good English and Italian,
having enjoyed the privilege of a superior education.His fervent
prayers at the family altar morning and evening made a very deep
impression on my mind.He became deeply interested in my history, and
offered to take me to France, after I should become his lawful wife.Though I did not like the idea of choosing another popish country for my
residence, yet as my friend assured me that I should enjoy my protestant
religion unmolested, I gave him my hand and my heart.My lady fellow
passenger was my bridesmaid.We were married by a good protestant
minister.My husband is a wealthy merchant--gives me means and
opportunities for doing good.Our
home is one of piety and peace and happiness.The blessed Bible is read
by us every day.Morning and evening we sing God's praise, and call upon
the name of the Lord.Our prayer is that God may deliver beloved France
and Italy from the curse of popery.Another proof of the persecuting spirit of Rome is furnished by the
"Narrative of Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, but who now
'comes forth from Inquisitorial search and torture, and tells us what
he has seen, heard and felt.'"We can make but a few extracts from
this interesting little volume, published by the American and Foreign
Christian Union, who,--to use their own language--"send it forth as a
voice of instruction and warning to the American people.They are not to be set aside by an apology for the
dark ages, nor an appeal to the refinement of the nineteenth century.Here is Rome, not as she WAS in the midnight of the world, but as she
IS at the present moment.There is the same opposition to private
judgment--the same coercive measures--the same cruel persecution--the
same efforts to crush the civil and religious liberties of her own
subjects, for which she has ever been characterized."Ciocci, compelled at an early age to enter the Catholic College--forced,
notwithstanding his deep disgust and earnest remonstrance, to become a
monk--imprisoned--deceived--the victim of priestly artifice and fraud,
at length becomes a Christian.He is of course thrown into a deeper
dungeon; and more exquisite anguish inflicted upon him that he may be
constrained to return to the Romish faith.Of his imprisonment he says,
"We traversed long corridors till we arrived at the door of an apartment
which they requested me to enter, and they themselves retired.On
opening the door I found myself in a close dark room, barely large
enough for the little furniture it contained, which consisted of a small
hard bed, hard as the conscience of an inquisitor, a little table cut
all over, and a dirty ill-used chair.The window which was shut and
barred with iron resisted all my efforts to open it My heart sunk within
me, and I began to cogitate on the destiny in store for me."The Jesuit
Giuliani entering his room, he asked that the window might be opened
for the admission of light and air.Before the words were finished he
exclaimed in a voice of thunder, "How!wretched youth, thou complainest
of the dark, whilst thou art living in the clouds of error?Dost thou
desire the light of heaven, while thou rejectest the light of the
Catholic faith?"Ciocci saw that remonstrance was useless, but he reminded his jailer
that he had been sent there for three days, to receive instruction, not
to be treated as a criminal."For three days," he resumed, counterfeiting my tone of voice, "for
three days!The dainty youth will not forsooth,
be roughly treated; it remains to be seen whether he desires to be
courteously entertained.Fortunate is it for thee that thou art come to this place.THOU WILT
NEVER quit it excepting with the real fruits of repentance!Among these
silent shades canst thou meditate at thy leisure upon the deplorable
state into which thou hast fallen.Woe unto thee, if thou refusest to
listen to the voice of God, who conducts souls into solitude that he
may speak with them.""So saying," he continues, "he abruptly left me.I
remained alone drooping under the weight of a misfortune, which was the
more severe, because totally unexpected.I stood, I know not how long,
in the same position, but on recovering from this lethargy, my first
idea was of flight.Without giving a minute account of the manner
in which I passed my wearisome days and nights in this prison, let it
suffice to say that they were spent in listening to sermons preached to
me four times a day by the fathers Giuliani and Rossini, and in the most
gloomy reflections."In the mean time the miseries I endured were aggravated by the heat of
the season, the wretchedness of the chamber, scantiness of food, and the
rough severity of those by whom I was occasionally visited.Uncertainty
as to when this imprisonment would be at an end, almost drove me wild,
and the first words I addressed to those who approached me were, 'Have
the kindness to tell me when I shall be permitted to leave this place?'One replied, 'My son, think of hell.'I interrogated another; the answer
was, 'Think my son, how terrible is the death of the sinner!'I spoke
to a third, to a fourth, and one said to me, 'My son, what will be your
feeling, if, on the day of judgment you find yourself on the left hand
of God?'the other, 'Paradise, my son, Paradise!'No one gave me a
direct answer; their object appeared to be to mistify and confound me.After the first few days, I began to feel most severely the want of
a change of clothing.Accustomed to cleanliness, I found myself
constrained to wear soiled apparel.* * * For the want of a comb, my
hair became rough and entangled.After the fourth day my portion of food
was diminished; a sign, that they were pressing the siege, that it was
their intention to adopt both assault and blockade--to conquer me by
arms, or induce me to capitulate through hunger.I had been shut up in
this wretched place for thirteen days, when, one day, about noon, the
Father Mislei, the author of all my misery, entered my cell."At the sight of this man, resentment overcame every other
consideration, and I advanced towards him fully prepared to indulge my
feelings, when he, with his usual smile, expressed in bland words
his deep regret at having been the cause of my long detention in this
retreat.'Never could I have supposed,' said he, 'that my anxiety
for the salvation of your soul would have brought you into so much
tribulation.But rest assured the fault is not entirely mine.You have
yourself, in a great degree, by your useless obstinacy, been the cause
of your sufferings.Ah, well, we will yet remedy all.'Not feeling any
confidence in his assurance, I burst out into bitter invectives and
fierce words.He then renewed his protestations, and clothed them with
such a semblance of honesty and truth, that when he ended with this
tender conclusion, 'Be assured, my son, that I love you,' my anger
vanished.* * * I lost sight of the Jesuit, and thought I was addressing
a man, a being capable of sympathising in the distresses of others.'Ah,
well, father,' said I, 'I need some one on whom I can rely, some one
towards whom I can feel kindly; I will therefore place confidence in
your words.'"After some further conversation, Ciocci was asked if
he wished to leave that place.he replied, "what a
strange question!You might as well ask a condemned soul whether he
desires to escape from hell!"At these words the Jesuit started like a
goaded animal, and, forgetting his mission of deceiver, with, knit brows
and compressed lips, he allowed his ferocious soul for one moment
to appear; but, having grown old in deceit, he immediately had the
circumspection to give this movement of rage the appearance of religious
zeal, and exclaimed, "What comparisons are these?Are you not ashamed to
assume the language of the Atheist?By speaking in this way you clearly
manifest how little you deserve to leave this place.But since I have
told you that I love you, I will give you a proof of it by thinking no
more of those irreligious expressions; they shall be forgotten as though
they had never been spoken.Well, the Cardinal proposes to you an easy
way of returning to your monastery.""Here is
the way," said he, presenting me with a paper: "copy this with your
own hand; nothing more will be required of you.""I took the paper with
convulsive eagerness.It was a recantation of my faith, there condemned
as erroneous.* * * Upon reading this, I shuddered, and, starting to my
feet, in a solemn attitude and with a firm voice, exclaimed, 'Kill me,
if you please; my life is in your power; but never will I subscribe
to that iniquitous formulary.'The Jesuit, after laboring in vain
to persuade me to his wishes, went away in anger.I now momentarily
expected to be conducted to the torture.Whenever I was taken from my
room to the chapel, I feared lest some trap-door should open beneath
my feet, and therefore took great care to tread in the footsteps of the
Jesuit who preceded me.No one acquainted with the Inquisition will say
that my precaution was needless.My imagination was so filled with the
horrors of this place, that even in my short, interrupted, and feverish
dreams I beheld daggers and axes glittering around me; I heard the noise
of wheels, saw burning piles and heated irons, and woke in convulsive
terror, only to give myself up to gloomy reflections, inspired by the
reality of my situation, and the impressions left by these nocturnal
visions.What tears did I shed in those dreary moments!How innumerable
were the bitter wounds that lacerated my heart!My prayers seemed to me
unworthy to be received by a God of charity, because, notwithstanding
all my efforts to banish from my soul every feeling of resentment
towards my persecutors, hatred returned with redoubled power.I often
repeated the words of Christ, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what
they do;' but immediately a voice would answer, 'This prayer is not
intended for the Jesuits; they resemble not the crucifiers, who were
blind instruments of the rage of the Jews; while these men are fully
conscious of what they are doing; they are the modern Pharisees.'The
reading of the Bible would have afforded me great consolation, but this
was denied me."* * *

The fourteenth day of his imprisonment he was taken to the council
to hear his sentence, when he was again urged to sign the form of
recantation.The Father Rossini then spoke: "You are
decided; let it be, then, as you deserve.Rebellious son of the church,
in the fullness of the power which she has received from Christ, you
shall feel the holy rigor of her laws.She cannot permit tares to grow
with the good seed.She cannot suffer you to remain among her sons and
become the stumbling-block for the ruin of many.Abandon, therefore,
all hope of leaving this place, and of returning to dwell among the
faithful.KNOW, ALL IS FINISHED FOR YOU!"For the conclusion of this narrative we refer the reader to the volume
itself.If any more evidence were needed to show that the spirit of Romanism is
the same to-day that it has ever been, we find it in the account of
a legal prosecution against ten Christians at Beldac, in France,
for holding and attending a public worship not licensed by the civil
authority.They had made repeated, respectful, and earnest applications
to the prefect of the department of Hante-Vienne for the authorization
required by law, and which, in their case, ought to have been given.They persisted in rendering to God that worship
which his own command and their consciences required.For this they were
arraigned as above stated, on the 10th of August, 1855.On the 26th of
January, 1856, the case was decided by the "tribunal," and the three
pastors and one lady, a schoolmistress, were condemned to pay a fine
of one thousand francs each, and some of the others five-hundred francs
each, the whole amount, together with legal expenditures, exceeding the
sum of nine thousand francs.Meantime, the converts continue to hold their worship-meetings in the
woods, barns, and secret places, in order not to be surprised by the
police commissioner, and to avoid new official reports."Thus, you see," says V. De Pressense, in a letter to the 'American and
foreign Christian Union,' "that we are brought back to the religious
meetings of the desert, when the Protestants of the Cevennes evinced
such persevering fidelity.The only difference is, that these Christians
belonged only a short time ago to that church which is now instigating
persecutions against them."DESTRUCTION OF THE INQUISITION IN SPAIN.Lehmanowsky was attached to the part of Napoleon's army
which was stationed in Madrid.L., "I
used to speak freely among the people what I thought of the Priests
and Jesuits, and of the Inquisition.It had been decreed by the Emperor
Napoleon that the Inquisition and the Monasteries should be suppressed,
but the decree, he said, like some of the laws enacted in this country,
was not executed."Months had passed away, and the prisons of the Inquisition had not been
opened.One night, about ten or eleven o'clock, as he was walking one of
the streets of Madrid, two armed men sprang upon him from an alley, and
made a furious attack.He instantly drew his sword, put himself in a
posture of defence, and while struggling with them, he saw at a distance
the lights of the patrols,--French soldiers mounted, who carried
lanterns, and who rode through the streets of the city at all hours of
the night, to preserve order.He called to them in French, and as they
hastened to his assistance, the assailants took to their heels and
escaped; not, however, before he saw by their dress that they belonged
to the guards of the Inquisition.He went immediately to Marshal Soult, then Governor of Madrid, told him
what had taken place, and reminded him of the decree to suppress this
institution.Marshal Soult told him that he might go and suppress it The
Colonel said that his regiment (the 9th.of the Polish Lancers,) was not
sufficient for such a service, but if he would give him two additional
regiments, the 117th, and another which he named, he would undertake the
work.The 117th regiment was under the command of Col.De Lile, who
is now, like Col.L., a minister of the gospel, and pastor of an
evangelical church in Marseilles, France."The troops required were
granted, and I proceeded," said Col.L., "to the Inquisition which was
situated about five miles from the city.It was surrounded by a wall of
great strength, and defended by a company of soldiers.When we arrived
at the walls, I addressed one of the sentinels, and summoned the holy
fathers to surrender to the Imperial army, and open the gates of the
Inquisition.The sentinel who was standing on the wall, appeared to
enter into conversation with some one within, at the close of which he
presented his musket, and shot one of my men.This was the signal of
attack, and I ordered my troops to fire upon those who appeared on the
walls."It was soon obvious that it was an unequal warfare.The soldiers of the
holy office were partially protected by a breast-work upon the walls
which were covered with soldiers, while our troops were in the open
plain, and exposed to a destructive fire.We had no cannon, nor could
we scale the walls, and the gates successfully resisted all attempts at
forcing them.I could not retire and send for cannon to break through
the walls without giving them time to lay a train for blowing us up.I saw that it was necessary to change the mode of attack, and directed
some trees to be cut down and trimmed, to be used as battering rams.Two
of these were taken up by detachments of men, as numerous as could work
to advantage, and brought to bear upon the walls with all the power they
could exert, while the troops kept up a fire to protect them from the
fire poured upon them from the walls.Presently the walls began to
tremble, a breach was made, and the Imperial troops rushed into the
Inquisition.Here we met with an incident, which nothing but Jesuitical
effrontery is equal to.The Inquisitor General, followed by the father
confessors in their priestly robes, all came out of their rooms, as we
were making our way into the interior of the Inquisition, and with long
faces, and arms crossed over their breasts, their fingers resting on
their shoulders, as though they had been deaf to all the noise of
the attack and defence, and had just learned what was going on, they
addressed themselves in the language of rebuke to their own soldiers,
saying, "WHY DO YOU FIGHT OUR FRIENDS, THE FRENCH?"Their intention, no doubt, was to make us think that this defence was
wholly unauthorized by them, hoping, if they could make us believe
that they were friendly, they should have a better opportunity, in the
confusion of the moment, to escape.Their artifice was too shallow, and
did not succeed.I caused them to be placed under guard, and all
the soldiers of the Inquisition to be secured as prisoners.We then
proceeded to examine all the rooms of the stately edifice.We passed
through room after room; found all perfectly in order, richly furnished,
with altars and crucifixes, and wax candles in abundance, but we could
discover no evidences of iniquity being practiced there, nothing of
those peculiar features which we expected to find in an Inquisition.We found splendid paintings, and a rich and extensive library.Here was
beauty and splendor, and the most perfect order on which my eyes
had ever rested.The
ceilings and floors of wood were scoured and highly polished.The marble
floors were arranged with a strict regard to order.There was everything
to please the eye and gratify a cultivated taste; but where were those
horrid instruments of torture, of which we had been told, and where
those dungeons in which human beings were said to be buried alive?The holy father assured us that they had been
belied; that we had seen all; and I was prepared to give up the search,
convinced that this Inquisition was different from others of which I had
heard.De Idle was not so ready as myself to give up the search, and
said to me, "Colonel, you are commander to-day, and as you say, so it
must be; but if you will be advised by me, let this marble floor be
examined.Let water be brought and poured upon it, and we will watch
and see if there is any place through which it passes more freely than
others."I replied to him, "Do as you please, Colonel," and ordered
water to be brought accordingly.The slabs of marble were large and
beautifully polished.When the water had been poured over the floor,
much to the dissatisfaction of the inquisitors, a careful examination
was made of every seam in the floor, to see if the water passed through.De Lile exclaimed that he had found it.By the side of
one of these marble slabs the water passed through fast, as though
there was an opening beneath.All hands were now at work for further
discovery; the officers with their swords and the soldiers with their
bayonets, seeking to clear out the seam, and pry up the slab; others
with the butts of their muskets striking the slab with all their might
to break it, while the priests remonstrated against our desecrating
their holy and beautiful house.While thus engaged, a soldier, who was
striking with the butt of his musket, struck a spring, and the marble
slab flew up.Then the faces of the inquisitors grew pale as Belshazzar
when the hand writing appeared on the wall; they trembled all over;
beneath the marble slab, now partly up, there was a stair-case.I
stepped to the altar, and took from the candlestick one of the candles
four feet in length, which was burning that I might explore the room
below.As I was doing this, I was arrested by one of the inquisitors,
who laid his hand gently on my arm, and with a very demure and holy look
said "My son, you must not take those lights with your bloody hands they
are holy.""Well," said I, "I will take a holy thing to shed light
on iniquity; I will bear the responsibility."I took the candle, and
proceeded down the stair-case.As we reached the foot of the stairs
we entered a large room which was called the hall of judgment.In the
centre of it was a large block, and a chain fastened to it.On this they
were accustomed to place the accused, chained to his seat.On one side
of the room was an elevated seat called the Throne of Judgment.This,
the Inquisitor General occupied, and on either side were seats less
elevated, for the holy fathers when engaged in the solemn business of
the Holy Inquisition.From this room we proceeded to the right, and obtained access to small
cells extending the entire length of the edifice; and here such sights
were presented as we hoped never to see again.Three cells were places
of solitary confinement, where the wretched objects of inquisitorial
hate were confined year after year, till death released them from their
sufferings, and their bodies were suffered to remain until they were
entirely decayed, and the rooms had become fit for others to occupy.To prevent this being offensive to those who occupied the Inquisition,
there were flues or tubes extending to the open air, sufficiently
capacious to carry off the odor.In these cells we found the remains
of some who had paid the debt of nature: some of them had been dead
apparently but a short time, while of others nothing remained but their
bones, still chained to the floor of their dungeon.In others we found living sufferers of both sexes and of every age, from
three score years and ten down to fourteen or fifteen years--all naked
as they were born into the world!Here were old men
and aged women, who had been shut up for many years.Here, too, were the
middle aged, and the young man and the maiden of fourteen years old.The soldiers immediately went to work to release the captives from
their chains, and took from their knapsacks their overcoats and
other clothing, which they gave to cover their nakedness.They were
exceedingly anxious to bring them out to the light of day; but Col.L., aware of the danger, had food given them, and then brought them
gradually to the light, as they were able to bear it.L., to explore another room on the left.Here we found the instruments of torture, of every kind which the
ingenuity of men or devils could invent.L., here described four
of these horrid instruments.The first was a machine by which the victim
was confined, and then, beginning with the fingers, every joint in the
hands, arms and body, were broken or drawn one after another, until the
victim died.The second was a box, in which the head and neck of the
victim were so closely confined by a screw that he could not move in any
way.Over the box was a vessel, from which one drop of water a second,
fell upon the head of the victim;--every successive drop falling upon
precisely the same place on the head, suspended the circulation in a few
moments, and put the sufferer in the most excruciating agony.The third
was an infernal machine, laid horizontally, to which the victim was
bound; the machine then being placed between two beams, in which were
scores of knives so fixed that, by turning the machine with a crank, the
flesh of the sufferer was torn from his limbs, all in small pieces.The
fourth surpassed the others in fiendish ingenuity.Its exterior was
a beautiful woman, or large doll, richly dressed, with arms extended,
ready, to embrace its victim.Around her feet a semi-circle was drawn.The victim who passed over this fatal mark, touched a spring which
caused the diabolical engine to open; its arms clasped him, and a
thousand knives cut him into as many pieces in the deadly embrace.L., said that the sight of these engines of infernal cruelty kindled the
rage of the soldiers to fury.They declared that every inquisitor and
soldier of the inquisition should be put to the torture.They might have turned their
arms against him if he had attempted to arrest their work.The first they put to death in the machine for
breaking joints.The torture of the inquisitor put to death by the
dropping of water on his head was most excruciating.The poor man cried
out in agony to be taken from the fatal machine.The inquisitor general
was brought before the infernal engine called "The Virgin.""No" said they, "you have caused others to kiss her, and
now you must do it."They interlocked their bayonets so as to form large
forks, and with these pushed him over the deadly circle.The beautiful
image instantly prepared for the embrace, clasped him in its arms,
and he was cut into innumerable pieces.L. said, he witnessed the
torture of four of them--his heart sickened at the awful scene--and he
left the soldiers to wreak their vengeance on the last guilty inmate of
that prison-house of hell.In the mean time it was reported through Madrid that the prisons of the
Inquisition were broken open, and multitudes hastened to the fatal spot.And, Oh, what a meeting was there!About a
hundred who had been buried for many years were now restored to life.There were fathers who had found their long lost daughters; wives were
restored to their husbands, sisters to their brothers, parents to their
children; and there were some who could recognize no friend among the
multitude.The scene was such as no tongue can describe.L. caused the library, paintings,
furniture, etc., to be removed, and having sent to the city for a wagon
load of powder, he deposited a large quantity in the vaults beneath
the building, and placed a slow match in connection with it.All had
withdrawn to a distance, and in a few moments there was a most joyful
sight to thousands.The walls and turrets of the massive structure rose
majestically towards the heavens, impelled by the tremendous explosion,
and fell back to the earth an immense heap of ruins.Lehmanowsky of the destruction of the
inquisition in Spain.Was it then finally destroyed, never again to be
revived?Giacinto Achilli, D. D.
Surely, his statements in this respect can be relied upon, for he is
himself a convert from Romanism, and was formerly the "Head Professor of
Theology, and Vicar of the Master of the Sacred Apostolic Palace."He certainly had every opportunity to obtain correct information on the
subject, and in a book published by him in 1851, entitled "Dealings
with the Inquisition," we find, (page 71) the following startling
announcement."We are now in the middle of the nineteenth century, and
still the Inquisition is actually and potentially in existence.This
disgrace to humanity, whose entire history is a mass of atrocious
crimes, committed by the priests of the Church of Rome, in the name of
God and of His Christ, whose vicar and representative, the pope, the
head of the Inquisition, declares himself to be,--this abominable
institution is still in existence in Rome and in the Roman States."Again, (page 89) he says, "And this most infamous Inquisition, a hundred
times destroyed and as often renewed, still exists in Rome as in the
barbarous ages; the only difference being that the same iniquities are
at present practiced there with a little more secrecy and caution than
formerly, and this for the sake of prudence, that the Holy See may not
be subjected to the animadversions of the world at large."On page 82 of the same work we find the following language."I do not
propose to myself to speak of the Inquisition of times past, but of what
exists in Rome at the present moment; I shall therefore assert that the
laws of this institution being in no respect changed, neither can the
institution itself be said to have undergone any alteration.The present
race of priests who are now in power are too much afraid of the popular
indignation to let loose all their inquisitorial fury, which might even
occasion a revolt if they were not to restrain it; the whole world,
moreover, would cry out against them, a crusade would be raised against
the Inquisition, and, for a little temporary gratification, much power
would be endangered.This is the true reason why the severity of its
penalties is in some degree relaxed at the present time, but they still
remain unaltered in its code."Again on page 102, he says, "Are the torments which are employed at the
present day at the Inquisition all a fiction?It requires the impudence
of an inquisitor, or of the Archbishop of Westminister to deny their
existence.I have myself heard these evil-minded persons lament and
complain that their victims were treated with too much lenity.I inquired of the inquisitor of Spoleto.Thomas Aquinas says," answered he; "DEATH TO ALL THE
HERETICS.""Hand over, then, to one of these people, a person, however respectable;
give him up to one of the inquisitors, (he who quoted St.Thomas Aquinas
to me was made an Archbishop)--give up, I say, the present Archbishop of
Canterbury, an amiable and pious man, to one of these rabid inquisitors;
he must either deny his faith or be burned alive.Is not this the spirit that invariably actuates the
inquisitors?and not the inquisitors only, but all those who in any
way defile themselves with the inquisition, such as bishops and their
vicars, and all those who defend it, as the <DW7>s do.Wiseman, the Archbishop of Westminster according to the
pope's creation, the same who has had the assurance to censure me from
his pulpit, and to publish an infamous article in the Dublin Review, in
which he has raked together, as on a dunghill, every species of filth
from the sons of Ignatius Loyola; and there is no lie or calumny that he
has not made use of against me.Well, then, suppose I were to be handed
over to the tender mercy of Dr.Wiseman, and he had the full power to
dispose of me as he chose, without fear of losing his character in
the eyes of the nation to which, by parentage more than by merit, he
belongs, what do you imagine he would do with me?Should I not have to
undergo some death more terrible than ordinary?Would not a council be
held with the reverend fathers of the company of Loyola, the same who
have suggested the abominable calumnies above alluded to, in order
to invent some refined method of putting me out of the world?I feel
persuaded that if I were condemned by the Inquisition to be burned
alive, my calumniator would have great pleasure in building my funeral
pile, and setting fire to it with his own hands; or should strangulation
be preferred, that he would, with equal readiness, arrange the cord
around my neck; and all for the honor and glory of the Inquisition, of
which, according to his oath, he is a true and faithful servant."Achilli is the spirit of Romanism!Can we
doubt that it would lead to results as frightful as anything described
in the foregoing story?But let us listen to his further remarks on the present state of the
Inquisition.On page 75 he says, "What, then, is the Inquisition of the
nineteenth century?The same system of intolerance which prevailed in
the barbarous ages.That which raised the Crusade and roused all Europe
to arms at the voice of a monk [Footnote: Bernard of Chiaravalle.]and
of a hermit, [Footnote: Peter the Hermit.]That which--in the name of
a God of peace, manifested on earth by Christ, who, through love
for sinners, gave himself to be crucified--brought slaughter on the
Albigenses and the Waldenses; filled France with desolation, under
Domenico di Guzman; raised in Spain the funeral pile and the scaffold,
devastating the fair kingdoms of Granada and Castile, through the
assistance of those detestable monks, Raimond de Pennefort, Peter
Arbues, and Cardinal Forquemorda.That, which, to its eternal infamy,
registers in the annals of France the fatal 24th of August, and the 5th
of November in those of England."That same system which at this moment flourishes at Rome, which has
never yet been either worn out or modified, and which at this present
time, in the jargon of the priests, is called a "the holy, Roman,
universal, apostolic Inquisition.Holy, as the place where Christ was
crucified is holy; apostolic, because Judas Iscariot was the first
inquisitor; Roman and universal, because FROM ROME IT EXTENDS OVER ALL
THE WORLD.It is denied by some that the Inquisition which exists in
Rome as its centre, is extended throughout the world by means of the
missionaries.The Roman Inquisition and the Roman Propaganda are in
close connection with each other.Every bishop who is sent in partibus
infidelium, is an inquisitor charged to discover, through the means of
his missionaries, whatever is said or done by others in reference to
Rome, with the obligation to make his report secretly.The Apostolic
nuncios are all inquisitors, as are also the Apostolic vicars.Here,
then, we see the Roman Inquisition extending to the most remote
countries."Again this same writer informs us, (page 112,) that "the
principal object of the Inquisition is to possess themselves, by
every means in their power, of the secrets of every class of society.Consequently its agents (Jesuits and Missionaries,) enter the domestic
circle, observe every motion, listen to every conversation, and would,
if possible, become acquainted with the most hidden thoughts.It is in
fact, the police, not only of Rome, but of all Italy; INDEED, IT MAY BE
SAID OF THE WHOLE WORLD."Achilli are fully corroborated by the Rev.In a book published by him in 1852, entitled
"The Brand of Dominic," we find the following remarks in relation to the
Inquisition of the present time.The Roman Inquisition is, therefore,
acknowledged to have an infinite multitude of affairs constantly on
hand, which necessitates its assemblage thrice every week.Still there
are criminals, and criminal processes.The body of officials are still
maintained on established revenues of the holy office.So far from any
mitigation of severity or judicial improvement in the spirit of its
administration, the criminal has now no choice of an advocate; but one
person, and he a servant of the Inquisition, performs an idle ceremony,
under the name of advocacy, for the conviction of all.And let the
reader mark, that as there are bishops in partibus, so, in like manner,
there are inquisitors of the same class appointed in every country, and
chiefly, in Great Britain and the colonies, who are sworn to secrecy,
and of course communicate intelligence to this sacred congregation of
all that can be conceived capable of comprehension within the infinitude
of its affairs.We must, therefore, either believe that the court
of Rome is not in earnest, and that this apparatus of universal
jurisdiction is but a shadow,--an assumption which is contrary to all
experience,--or we must understand that the spies and familiars of the
Inquisition are listening at our doors, and intruding themselves on our
hearths.How they proceed, and what their brethren at Rome are doing,
events may tell; BUT WE MAY BE SURE THEY ARE NOT IDLE.They were not idle in Rome in 1825, when they rebuilt the prisons of
the Inquisition.They were not idle in 1842, when they imprisoned Dr.Achilli for heresy, as he assures us; nor was the captain, or some other
of the subalterns, who, acting in their name, took his watch from him
as he came out.They were not idle in 1843, when they renewed the old
edicts against the Jews.And all the world knows that the inquisitors on
their stations throughout the pontifical states, and the inquisitorial
agents in Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, were never more active
than during the last four years, and even at this moment, when every
political misdemeanor that is deemed offensive to the Pope, is,
constructively, a sin against the Inquisition, and visited with
punishment accordingly.A deliberative body, holding formal session
thrice every week, cannot be idle, and although it may please them to
deny that Dr.Achilli saw and examined a black book, containing the
praxis now in use, the criminal code of inquisitors in force at this
day,--as Archibald Bower had an abstract of such a book given him for
his use about one hundred and thirty years ago,--they cannot convince
me that I have not seen and handled, and used in the preparation of this
volume, the compendium of an unpublished Roman code of inquisitorial
regulations, given to the vicars of the inquisitor-general of Modena.They may be pleased to say that the mordacchia, or gag, of which Dr.Achilli speaks, as mentioned in that BLACK BOOK, is no longer used;
but that it is mentioned there, and might be used again is more than
credible to myself, after having seen that the "sacred congregation" has
fixed a rate of fees for the ordering, witnessing, and administration of
TORTURE.There was indeed, a talk of abolishing torture at Rome; but
we have reason to believe that the congregation will not drop the
mordacchia, inasmuch, as, instead of notifying any such reformation to
the courts of Europe, this congregation has kept silence.For although a
continuation of the bullary has just been published at Rome, containing
several decrees of this congregation, there is not one that announces
a fulfilment of this illusory promise,--a promise imagined by a
correspondent to French newspapers, but never given by the inquisitors
themselves.And as there is no proof that they have yet abstained from
torture, there is a large amount of circumstantial evidence that they
have delighted themselves in death.When public burnings
became inexpedient--as at Goa--did they not make provision for private
executions?For a third time at least the Roman prisons--I am not speaking of those
of the provinces--were broken open, in 1849, after the desertion of Pius
IX., and two prisoners were found there, an aged bishop and a nun.Many persons in Rome reported the event; but instead of copying what is
already before the public, I translate a letter addressed to me by P.
Alessandro Gavazzi, late chaplain-general of the Roman army, in reply
to a few questions which I had put to him.All who have heard his
statements may judge whether his account of facts be not marked with
every note of accuracy.They will believe that his power of oratory DOES
NOT betray him into random declamation.Under date of March 20th, 1852,
he writes thus:

"MY DEAR SIR,--In answering your questions concerning the palace of
Inquisition at Rome, I should say that I can give only a few superficial
and imperfect notes.So short was the time that it remained open to the
public, So great the crowd of persons that pressed to catch a sight of
it, and so intense the horror inspired by that accursed place, that I
could not obtain a more exact and particular impression."I found no instruments of torture, [Footnote: "The gag, the
thumb-screw, and many other instruments of severe torture could be
easily destroyed and others as easily procured.The non-appearance of
instruments is not enough to sustain the current belief that the use of
them is discontinued.So long as there is a secret prison, and while
all the existing standards of inquisitorial practice make torture
an ordinary expedient for extorting information, not even a bull,
prohibiting torture, would be sufficient to convince the world that
it has been discontinued.The practice of falsehood is enjoined on
inquisitors.How, then, could we believe a bull, or decree, if it were
put forth to-morrow, to release them from suspicion, or to screen them
from obloquy?It would not be entitled to belief."--Rev.for they were destroyed at the time of the first French invasion,
and because such instruments were not used afterwards by the modern
Inquisition.I did, however, find, in one of the prisons of the second
court, a furnace, and the remains of a woman's dress.I shall never be
able to believe that that furnace was placed there for the use of the
living, it not being in such a place, or of such a kind, as to be of
service to them.Everything, on the contrary, combines to persuade me
that it was made use of for horrible deaths, and to consume the remains
of the victims of inquisitorial executions.Another object of horror I
found between the great hall of judgment and the luxurious apartment of
the chief jailer (primo custode), the Dominican friar who presides over
this diabolical establishment.This was a deep trap or shaft opening
into the vaults under the Inquisition.As soon as the so-called criminal
had confessed his offence; the second keeper, who is always a Dominican
friar, sent him to the father commissary to receive a relaxation
[Footnote: "In Spain, RELAXATION is delivery to death.In the
established style of the Inquisition it has the same meaning.But in the
common language of Rome it means RELEASE.In the lips of the inquisitor,
therefore, if he used the word, it has one meaning, and another to the
ear of the prisoner."--Rev.With the
hope of pardon, the confessed culprit would go towards the apartment of
the holy inquisitor; but in the act of setting foot at its entrance,
the trap opened, and the world of the living heard no more of him.I
examined some of the earth found in the pit below this trap; it was a
compost of common earth, rottenness, ashes, and human hair, fetid to the
smell, and horrible to the sight and to the thought of the beholder."But where popular fury reached its highest pitch was in the vaults of
St.Pius V. I am anxious that you should note well that this pope was
canonized by the Roman church especially for his zeal against heretics.I will now describe to you the manner how, and the place where, those
vicars of Jesus Christ handled the living members of Jesus Christ, and
show you how they proceeded for their healing.You descend into the
vaults by very narrow stairs.A narrow corridor leads you to the
several cells, which, for smallness and stench, are a hundred times more
horrible than the dens of lions and tigers in the Colosseum.Wandering
in this labyrinth of most fearful prisons, that may be called 'graves
for the living,' I came to a cell full of skeletons without skulls,
buried in lime, and the skulls, detached from the bodies, had been
collected in a hamper by the first visitors.and why were they buried in that place and in that manner?I have heard
some popish priests trying to defend the Inquisition from the charge of
having condemned its victims to a secret death, say that the palace of
the Inquisition was built on a burial-ground, belonging anciently to a
hospital for pilgrims, and that the skeletons found were none other
than those of pilgrims who had died in that hospital.But everything
contradicts this papistical defence.Suppose that there had been a
cemetery there, it could not have had subterranean galleries and
cells, laid out with so great regularity; and even if there had been
such--against all probability--the remains of bodies would have been
removed on laying the foundation of the palace, to leave the space free
for the subterranean part of the Inquisition.Besides, it is contrary to
the use of common tombs to bury the dead by carrying them through a door
at the side; for the mouth of the sepulchre is always at the top.And
again, it has never been the custom in Italy to bury the dead singly in
quick lime; but, in time of plague, the dead bodies have been usually
laid in a grave until it was sufficiently full, and then quick lime has
been laid over them, to prevent pestilential exhalations, by hastening
the decomposition of the infected corpses.This custom was continued,
some years ago, in the cemeteries of Naples, and especially in the daily
burial of the poor.Therefore, the skeletons found in the Inquisition
of Rome could not belong to persons who had died a natural death in
a hospital; nor could any one, under such a supposition, explain the
mystery of all the bodies being buried in lime except the head.It
remains, then, beyond a doubt, that that subterranean vault contained
the victims of one of the many secret martyrdoms of the butcherly
tribunal.The following is the most probable opinion, if it be not
rather the history of a fact:

"The condemned were immersed in a bath of slaked lime, gradually filled
up to their necks.The lime by little and little enclosed the sufferers,
or walled them up alive.As the lime
rose higher and higher, the respiration became more and more painful,
because more difficult.So that what with the suffocation of the smoke,
and the anguish of the compressed breathing, they died in a manner most
horrible and desperate.Some time after their death the heads would
naturally separate from the bodies, and roll away into the hollows made
by the shrinking of the lime.Any other explanation of the feet that may
be attempted will be found improbable and unnatural.You may make what
use you please of these notes of mine, since I can warrant their
truth.I wish that writers, speaking of this infamous tribunal of the
Inquisition, would derive their information from pure history, unmingled
with romance; for so great and so many the historical atrocities of the
Inquisition, that they would more than suffice to arouse the detestation
of a thousand worlds.I know that the popish impostor-priests go about
saying that the Inquisition was never an ecclesiastical tribunal, but
a laic.But you will have shown the contrary in your work, and may also
add, in order quite to unmask these lying preachers, that the palace
of the Inquisition at Rome is under the shadow of the palace of the
Vatican; that the keepers are to this day, Dominican friars; and that
the prefect of the Inquisition at Rome is the Pope in person."I have the honor to be your affectionate Servant,

"ALESSANDRA GAVAZZI.""The Roman parliament decreed the erection of a pillar opposite the
palace of the Inquisition, to perpetuate the memory of the destruction
of that nest of abominations; but before that or any other monument
could be raised, the French army besieged and took the city, restored
the Pope, and with him the tribunal of the faith.Achilli thrown into one of its old prisons, on the 29th of July 1849,
but the violence of the people having made the building less adequate
to the purpose of safe keeping, he was transferred to the castle of
St.Angelo, which had often been employed for the custody of similar
delinquents, and there he lay in close confinement until the 9th of
January, 1850, when the French authorities, yielding to influential
representations from this country assisted him to escape in disguise as
a soldier, thus removing an occasion of scandal, but carefully leaving
the authority of the congregation of cardinals undisputed.Indeed
they first obtained the verbal sanction of the commissary, who saw it
expedient to let his victim go, and hush an outcry."Yet some have the hardihood to affirm that there is no longer any
Inquisition; and as the Inquisitors were instructed to suppress the
truth, to deny their knowledge of cases actually passing through their
hands, and to fabricate falsehoods for the sake of preserving the
SECRET, because the secret was absolutely necessary to the preservation
of their office, so do the Inquisitors in partibus falsify and illude
without the least scruple of conscience, in order to put the people of
this country off their guard."That the Inquisition really exists, is placed beyond a doubt by its
daily action as a visible institution at Rome.But if any one should
fancy that it was abolished after the release of Dr.Achilli, let him
hear a sentence contradictory, from a bull of the Pope himself, Pius IX,
a document that was dated at Rome, August 22, 1851, where the pontiff,
condemning the works of Professor Nuytz, of Turin, says, "after having
taken the advice of the doctors in theology and canon law, AFTER HAVING
COLLECTED THE SUFFRAGES OF OUR VENERABLE BROTHERS THE CARDINALS OF THE
CONGREGATION OF THE SUPREME AND UNIVERSAL INQUISITION."And so recently
as March, 1852, by letters of the Secretariate of State, he appointed
four cardinals to be "members of the Sacred Congregation of the Holy
Roman and Universal Inquisition;" giving incontrovertible evidence that
provision is made for attending to communications of Inquisitors in
partibus from all parts of the world.As the old cardinals die off,
their vacant seats are filled by others.The 'immortal legion' is
punctually recruited."After all, have we in Great Britain, Ireland and the colonies, and our
brethren of the foreign mission stations, any reason to apprehend harm
to, ourselves from the Inquisition as it is?In reply to this question,
let it be observed;

"1.That there are Inquisitors in partibus is not to be denied.That
letters of these Inquisitors are laid before the Roman Inquisition is
equally certain.Even in the time of Leo XII, when the church of
Rome was far less active in the British empire than it is now, some
particular case was always decided on Thursday, when the Pope, in his
character of universal Inquisitor, presided in the congregation.It
cannot be thought that now, in the height of its exultation, daring and
aggression, this congregation has fewer emissaries, or that they are
less active, or less communicative than they were at that time.We
also see that the number is constantly replenished.The cardinals Della
Genga-Sermattei; De Azevedo; Fornari; and Lucciardi have just been added
to it.Besides a cardinal in England, and a delegate in Ireland, there is
both in England and Ireland, a body of bishops, 'natural Inquisitors,'
as they are always acknowledged, and have often claimed to be; and these
natural Inquisitors are all sworn to keep the secret--the soul of the
Inquisition.Since, then, there are Inquisitors in partibus, appointed
to supply the lack of an avowed and stationary Inquisition, and since
the bishops are the very persons whom the court of Rome can best
command, as pledged for such a service, it is reasonable to suppose they
act in that capacity.Some of the proceedings of these bishops confirm the assurance that
there is now an Inquisition in activity in England.* * * The vigilance
exercised over families, also the intermeddling of priests with
education, both in families and schools, and with the innumerable
relations of civil society, can only be traced back to the Inquisitors
in partibus, whose peculiar duty, whether by help of confessors or
familiars, is to worm out every secret of affairs, private or public,
and to organize and conduct measures of repression or of punishment.Where the secular arm cannot be borrowed, and where offenders lie beyond
the reach of excommunication, irregular methods must be resorted to,
not rejecting any as too crafty or too violent.Discontented mobs, or
individual zealots are to be found or bought.What part the Inquisitors
in partibus play in Irish assassinations, or in the general mass of
murderous assaults that is perpetrated in the lower haunts of crime,
it is impossible to say.Under cover of confessional and Inquisitorial
secrets, spreads a broad field of action--a region of mystery--only
visible to the eye of God, and to those'most reverend and most eminent'
guardians of the papacy, who sit thrice every week, in the Minerva
and Vatican, and there manage the hidden springs of Inquisition on the
heretics, schismatics, and rebels, no less than on 'the faithful'
of realms.Who can calculate the extent of their power over those
'religious houses,' where so many of the inmates are but neophytes,
unfitted by British education for the intellectual and moral abnegation,
the surrender of mind and conscience, which monastic discipline
exacts?Yet they must be coerced into submission, and kept under penal
discipline.Who can tell how many of their own clergy are withdrawn
to Rome, and there delated, imprisoned, and left to perish, if not
'relaxed' to death, in punishment of heretical opinions or liberal
practices?We have heard of laymen, too, taken to Rome by force, or
decoyed thither under false pretences there to be punished by the
universal Inquisition; and whatever of incredibility may appear in some
tales of Inquisitorial abduction, the general fact that such abductions
have taken place, seems to be incontrovertible.And now that the
Inquisitors in partibus are distributed over Christendom, and that they
provide the Roman Inquisition with daily work from year's end to year's
end, is among the things most certain,--even the most careless of
Englishmen must acknowledge that we have all reason to apprehend much
evil from the Inquisition as it is.And no Christian can be aware of
this fact, without feeling himself more than ever bound to uphold
the cause of christianity, both at home and abroad, as the only
counteractive of so dire a curse, and the only remedy of so vast an
evil."E. A. Lawrence, writing of "Romanism at Rome," gives us the
following vivid description of the present state of the Roman Church."Next is seen at Rome the PROPAGANDA, the great missionary heart of the
whole masterly system.Noiselessly, by the multiform orders of monks and
nuns, as through so many veins and arteries, it sends out and receives
back its vital fluid.In its halls, the whole world is distinctly
mapped out, and the chief points of influence minutely marked.A kind of
telegraphic communication is established with the remotest stations in
South Africa and Siberia, and with almost every nook in our own land,
to which the myrmidons of Papal power look with the most of fear.It
is through means of this moral galvanic battery, set up in the Vatican,
that the Church of Rome has gained its power of UBIQUITY--has so well
nigh made itself OMNIPOTENT, as well as omnipresent."It is no mean or puny antagonist that strides across the path of a
free, spiritual and advancing Protestantism.And yet, with a simple
shepherd's sling, and the smooth stones gathered from Siloa's brook, God
will give it the victory."Once more let us look, and we shall find at Rome, still working in its
dark, malignant efficiency, the INQUISITION.Men are still made to pass
through fires of this Moloch.This is the grand defensive expedient of
the Papacy, and is the chief tribunal of the States.Its processes are
all as secret as the grave.Its cells are full of dead men's bones.They
call it the Asylum for the poor--a retreat for doubting and distressed
pilgrims, where they may have experience of the parental kindness of
their father the Pope, and their mother the church.Achilli had a trial of this beneficient discipline, when thrown
into the deep dungeon of St.And how many other poor victims of
this diabolical institution are at this moment pining in agony, heaven
knows."In America, we talk about Rome as having ceased to persecute.She holds to the principle as tenaciously as ever.Of the evil spirit of Protestantism she says, "This
kind goeth not out, but by fire."Hence she must hold both the principle and the power of persecution, of
compelling men to believe, or, if they doubt, of putting them to death
for their own good.Take from her this power and she bites the dust."It may perchance be said that the remarks of the Rev.William Rule,
quoted above, refer exclusively to the existing state of things is
England, Ireland, and the colonies.But who will dare to say, after a
careful investigation of the subject, that they do not apply with equal
force to these United States?Has America nothing to fear from the inquisitors--from the Jesuits?Is
it true that the "Inquisition still exists in Rome--that its code is
unchanged--that its emissaries are sent over all the world--that every
nuncio and bishop is an Inquisitor," and is it improbable that, even
now, torture rooms like those described in the foregoing story, may be
found in Roman Catholic establishments in this country?Yes, even here,
in Protestant, enlightened America!Have WE then nothing to fear from
Romanism?But a few days since a gentleman of learning and intelligence
when speaking of this subject, exclaimed, "What have we to do with the
Jesuits?The idea that we have aught
to fear from Romanism, is simply ridiculous!"In reply to this, allow
me to quote the language of the Rev.Manuel J. Gonsalves, leader of the
Madeira Exiles."The time will come when the American people will arise as one man, and
not only abolish the confessional, but will follow the example of many
of the European nations, who had no peace, or rest, till they banished
the Jesuits.These are the men, who bask in the sunbeams of popery, to
whom the pope has entrusted the vast interests of the king of Rome, in
this great Republic.Nine tenths of the Romish priests, now working hard
for their Master the pope, in this country, are full blooded Jesuits.The man of sin who is the head of the mystery of iniquity--through
the advice of the popish bishops now in this country, has selected
the Jesuitical order of priests, to carry on his great and gigantic
operations in the United States of America.Those Jesuits who
distinguish themselves the most in the destruction of Protestant Bible
religion, and who gain the largest number of protestant scholars for
popish schools and seminaries; who win most American converts to their
sect are offered great rewards in the shape of high offices in the
church.John Hughes, the Jesuit Bishop of the New York Romanists, was
rewarded by Pope Pius 9th, with an Archbishop's mitre, for his great,
zeal and success, in removing God's Holy Bible from thirty-eight public
schools in New York, and for procuring a papal school committee, to
examine every book in the hands of American children in the public
schools, that every passage of truth, in those books of history
unpalatable to the pope might be blotted out."Has America then nothing
to do with Romanism?But another gentleman exclaims, "What if Romanism be on the increase in
the United States!Is not their religion as dear to them, as ours is
to us?"M. J. Gonsalves would reply as follows."The
American people have been deceived, in believing THAT POPERY WAS A
RELIGION, not a very good one to be sure, but some kind of one.We might as well call the Archbishop of the
fallen angels, and his crew, a religious body of intelligent beings,
because they believe in an Almighty God, and tremble, as to call the man
of sin and his Jesuits, a body of religious saints.The tree is known
by its fruit, such as 'love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, meekness, faith, temperance, brotherly kindness;' and where
the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, Christian liberty, giving
to God and man their due unasked.Now we ask, what kind of fruit does
the tree of Popery bear, in any country, that it should claim homage,
and respect, as a good religion?"Such is the language of one who knew so well what popery was, that he
fled from it as from a hell upon earth.In his further remarks upon the horrors of convent life in the United
States, he fully confirms the statements in the foregoing narrative.He
says, "It is time that American gentlemen, who are so much occupied
in business, should think of the dangers of the confessional, and the
miseries endured by innocent, duped, American, imprisoned females in
this free country; and remember that these American ladies who have been
duped and enticed by Jesuitical intrigue and craft, into their female
convents, have no means of deliverance; they cannot write a letter to a
friend without the consent and inspection of the Mother Abbess, who
is always and invariably a female tyrant, a creature in the pay of the
Bishop, and dependent upon the Bishop for her despotic office of power.The poor, unfortunate, imprisoned American female has no means of
redress in her power.She cannot communicate her story of wrong and
suffering to any living being beyond the walls of her prison.She may
have a father, a mother, a dear brother, or a sister, who, if they knew
one-sixteenth part of her wrongs and sufferings, would fly at once to
see her and sympathize with her in her anguish.But the Jesuit confessor
attached to the prison is ever on the alert.Those ladies who appear the
most unhappy, and unreconciled to their prison, are compelled to attend
the confessional every day; and thus the artful Jesuit, by a thousand
cross questions, is made to understand perfectly the state of their
minds.The Lady Porter, or door-keeper and jailor, is always a creature
of the priest's, and a great favorite with the Mother Abbess.Should any
friends call to see an unhappy nun who is utterly unreconciled to her
fate, the Lady Porter is instructed to inform those relatives that the
dear nun they want to see so much, is so perfectly happy, and given up
to heavenly meditations, that she cannot be persuaded to see an earthly
relative.At the same time the Mother Abbess dismisses the relatives
with a very sorrowful countenance, and regrets very much, in appearance,
their disappointment.But the unhappy nun is never informed that her
friends or relatives have called to inquire after her welfare.How
amazing, that government should allow such prisons in the name of
religion!"CONVENT OF THE CAPUCHINS IN SANTIAGO

In a late number of "The American and Foreign Christian Union," we find
the following account of conventual life from a report of a Missionary
in Chile, South America."Now, my brother, let me give you an account related to me by a most
worthy English family, most of the members of which have grown up in the
country, confirmed also by common report, of the Convent of Capuchins,
in Santiago."The number of inmates is limited to thirty-two young ladies.The
admittance fee is $2000.When the nun enters she is dressed like a
bride, in the most costly material that wealth can command.There,
beside the altar of consecration, she devotes herself in the most
solemn, manner to a life of celibacy and mortification of the flesh
and spirit, with the deluded hope that her works will merit a brighter
mansion in the realms above."The forms of consecration being completed, she begins to cast off
her rich veil, costly vestments, all her splendid diamonds and
brilliants--which, in many instances, have cost, perhaps, from ten to
fifteen, or even twenty thousand dollars.Then her beautiful locks are
submitted to the tonsure; and to signify her deadness forever to the
world, she is clothed in a dress of coarse grey cloth, called serge, in
which she is to pass the miserable remnant of her days.The dark sombre
walls of her prison she can sever pass, and its iron-bound doors are
shut forever upon their new, youthful, and sensitive occupant.Rarely,
if ever, is she permitted to speak, and NEVER, NEVER, to see her friends
or The loved ones of home--to enjoy the embraces of a fond mother, or
devoted father, or the smiles of fraternal or sisterly affection.If
ever allowed to speak at all, it is through iron bars where she cannot
be seen, and in the presence of the abbess, to see that no complaint
escapes her lips.However much her bosom may swell with anxiety at the
sound of voices which were once music to her soul, and she may long to
pour out her cries and tears to those who once soothed every sorrow of
her heart; yet not a murmur must be uttered.The soul must suffer
its own sorrows solitary and alone, with none to sympathize, or grant
relief, and none to listen to its moans but the cold gloomy walls of her
tomb.No, no, not even the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that great alleviator
of all the sorrows of the heart, is allowed an entrance there.Besides being condemned to a meagre, insufficient
and unwholesome diet which they themselves must cook, the nuns are
not allowed to speak much with each other, except to say, 'Que morir
tenemos, 'we are to die,' or 'we must die,' and to reply, 'Ya los
sabemos,' 'we know it,' or 'already we know it'

"They pass most of their time in small lonely cells, where they sleep in
a narrow place dug out in the ground, in the shape of a coffin, without
bed of any kind, except a piece of coarse serge spread down; and their
daily dress is their only covering.'Tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, no more with his downy pinions
lights on his unsullied with a tear:' FOR EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY-FOUR
they are aroused by the bell to perform their 'Ave Maria's,' count their
rosaries, and such other blind devotions as may be imposed.Thus they
drag out a miserable existence, and when death calls the spirit to its
last account, the other nuns dig the grave with their own hands, within
the walls of the convent, and so perform the obsequies of their departed
sister."Thus, I have briefly given you not fiction!but a faithful narrative
of facts in regard to conventual life, and an establishment marked by
almost every form of sin, and yet making pretence of 'perfecting the
saints,' by the free and gentle influences of the gospel of Christ.What is done with the rich vestments and jewels?Where do the priests get all their brilliants to perform high mass
and adorn their processions?Where does all the hair of the saints come from, which is sold in
lockets for high prices as sure preventives of evil?Whose grave has been plundered to obtain RELICS to sell to the
ignorant.Where does the Romish Church obtain her SURPLUS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO
SELL TO THE needy, and not give it like our blessed Lord, 'without money
and without price?'Who is responsible for the FANATICISM that induces a young female
to incarcerate herself?Where is the authority in reason, in revelation, for such a life?"A young lady lately cast herself from the tower, and was dashed in
pieces, being led to do it, doubtless, in desperation.The convents of
this city, of the same order, require the same entrance fee, $2000.Of
course, none but the comparatively rich can avail themselves of this
perfection of godliness."Who will say that this mode of life has not been invented in order to
cut short life as rapidly as possible, that the $2000, with all the rich
diamonds upon initiation, may be repeated as frequently as possible?how true it is, that Romanism is the same merciless, cruel,
diabolical organisation, wherever it can fully develop itself, in
all lands.How truly is it denominated by the pen of inspiration the
'MYSTERY OF INIQUITY,' especially that part of it relating to these
secret institutions, and the whole order of the Jesuits."The editor of the "Christian Union", in his remarks on the above, says,
"Already the fair face of our country is disfigured by the existence
here and there of conventual establishments.At present they do not
show the hideous features which they, at least in some cases, assume in
countries where papal influence and authority are supreme.The genius of
our government and institutions necessarily exerts a restraining power,
which holds them from excesses to which, otherwise, they might run.But
they constitute a part of a system which is strongly at variance with
the interests of humanity, and merely wait the occurrence of favorable
circumstances to visit upon our land all the horrors which they have
inflicted elsewhere."How many conventual establishments there are now in the nation, few
Protestants, it is believed, know.And how many young females, guilty of
no crime against society, and condemned by no law of the land, are shut
up in their walls and doomed to a life which they did not anticipate
when entering them, a life which is more dreadful to them than death,
very few of the millions of our citizens conceive.The majority of our
people have slept over the whole subject, and the indifference thus
manifested has emboldened the priests to posh forward the extension
of the system, and the workmen are now busy in various places in
the construction of additional establishments.But such facts as are
revealed in this article, from the pen of our missionary, in connection
with things that are occurring around us, show that no time should be
lost in examining this whole subject of convents and monasteries, and in
legislating rightly about them."Again, when speaking of papal convents in the United States, the same
talented writer observes, "The time has fully come when Protestants
should lay aside their apathy and too long-cherished indifference in
respect to the movements of Rome in this land.It is time for them to
call to mind the testimony of their fathers, their bitter experiences
from the papal See, and to take effective measures to protect the
inheritance bequeathed to them, that they may hand it down to their
children free from corruption, as pure and as valuable as when they
received it.They should remember that Rome claims never to change, that
what she was in Europe when in the zenith of her power, she will be here
when fairly installed, and has ability to enforce her commands."Her numbers now on our soil, her nearly two thousand priests moving
about everywhere, her colleges and printing-presses, her schools and
convents, and enormous amounts of property held by her bishops, have
served as an occasion to draw out something of her spirit, and to show
that she is ARROGANT AND ABUSIVE TO THE EXTENT OF HER POWER."Scarcely a newspaper issues from her press, but is loaded with abuse of
Protestants and of their religion, and at every available point assaults
are made upon their institutions and laws; and Rome and her institutions
and interests are crowded into notice, and special privileges are loudly
clamored for."All Protestants, therefore, of every name, and of every religious and
political creed, we repeat it, who do not desire to ignore the past, and
to renounce all care or concern for the future, as to their children and
children's children, should lose no time in informing themselves of
the state of things around them in regard to the papacy and its
institutions.They should without delay devote their efforts and
influence to the protection of the country against those Popish
establishments and their usages which have been set up among us without
the authority of law, and under whose crushing weight some of the
nations of Europe have staggered and reeled for centuries, and have now
but little of their former power and glory remaining, and under which
Mexico, just upon our borders, has sunk manifestly beyond the power of
recovery."Let each individual seek to awaken an interest in this matter in
the mind of his neighbor.And if there be papal establishments in
the neighborhood under the names of'schools,''retreats','religions
communities,' or any other designation, which are at variance with, or
are not conformed to, the laws of the commonwealth in which they are
situated, let memorials be prepared and signed by the citizens, and
forwarded immediately to the legislature, praying that they may be
subjected to examination, and required to conform to the laws by which
all Protestant institutions of a public nature are governed."Let us exclude from our national territory all irresponsible
institutions.Let us seek to maintain a government of law, and insist
upon the equality of all classes before it."In closing these extracts, we beg leave to express ourselves in the
words of the Rev.Sunderland, of Washington city, in a sermon
delivered before the American and Foreign Christian Union, at its
anniversary in May, 1856."But new it is asked, 'Why all this tirade against Roman Catholics?'It is not against the unhappy millions that are
ground down under the iron heel of that enormous despotism.They are of
the common humanity, our brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.They need the same light instruction and salvation that we need.Like
ourselves they need the one God, the one mediator between God and man,
the man Christ Jesus; and from the heart we love and pity them.We would
grant them all the privileges which we claim to ourselves.We can have
no animosity towards them as men and candidates with ourselves for the
coming judgment.But it is the system under which they are born, and
live, and die, I repeat, which we denounce, and when we shall cease to
oppose it, then let our right hand forget her cunning, and our tongue
cleave to the roof of our mouth.What is it but a dark and terrible
power on earth before which so many horrible memories start up?Why,
sir, look at it!We drag the bones of the grim behemoth out to view, for
we would not have the world forget his ugliness nor the terror he has
inspired.'A tirade against Romanism,' is it?O sir, we remember
the persecutions of Justinian; we remember the days of the Spanish
Inquisition; we remember the reign of 'the Bloody Mary;' we remember
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; we remember St.Bartholomew;
we remember the murdered Covenanters, Huguenots, and Piedmontese; we
remember the noble martyrs dying for the testimony of the faith along
the ancient Rhine; we remember the later wrath which pursued the
islanders of Madeira, till some of them sought refuge upon these
shores; we remember the Madiai, and we know how the beast ever seeks to
propagate his power, by force where he can, by deception where he must.And when we remember these things, we must protest against the further
vigor and prosperity of this grand Babylon of all.Take it, then, tirade
and all, for so ye must, ye ministers of Rome, sodden with the fumes of
that great deep of abominations!The voice of the Protestant shall never
be hushed; the spirit of Reformation shall never sleep.O, lands of
Farel and of Calvin, of Zwingle and of Luther!O countries where the
trumpet first sounded, marshalling the people to this fearful contest!We have heard the blast rolling still louder down the path of three
hundred years, and in our solid muster-march we come, the children
of the tenth generation.We come a growing phalanx, not with carnal
weapons, but with the armor of the gospel, and wielding the sword of
truth on the right hand and on the left, we say that ANTICHRIST MUST
FALL.Hear it, ye witnesses, and mark the word; by the majesty of the
coming kingdom of Jesus, and by the eternal purpose of Jehovah, THIS
ANTICHRIST MUST FALL."That fish could live in a barrel of whisky
and not get drunk.That fish, my son, is called a mullet-head: it has
got no brains."Gough, turning to the
brewer's drayman, 'for our friend here being able for twenty years to
drink a gallon of beer and a pint of whisky daily and never become
drunk.'And so, my chums," said Handy Andy, "if you will apply the same
reasoning to the cases of Sergeant Macpherson and Captain Waterman I
think you will come to the correct conclusion why the fright did not
upset the intellect of Sergeant Macpherson."We all joined in the laugh
at Handy Andy's story, and none more heartily than the butt of it, Sandy
Macpherson himself.Shortly after the roll was called at the
Martiniere, a most unfortunate accident took place.Corporal Cooper and
four or five men went into one of the rooms of the Martiniere in which
there was a quantity of loose powder which had been left by the enemy,
and somehow,--it was never known how--the powder got ignited and they
were all blown up, their bodies completely charred and their eyes
scorched out.The poor fellows all died in the greatest agony within an
hour or so of the accident, and none of them ever spoke to say how it
happened.The quantity of powder was not sufficient to shatter the
house, but it blew the doors and windows out, and burnt the poor fellows
as black as charcoal.This sad accident cast a gloom over the regiment,
and made me again very mindful of and thankful for my own narrow
escape, and that of my comrades in the Shah Nujeef on that memorable
night of the 16th of November.Later in the day our sadness increased when it was found that
Colour-Sergeant Alexander Knox, of No.He had
called the roll of his company at daylight, and had then gone to see a
friend in the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders.He had stayed some time with
his friend and left to return to his own regiment, but was never heard
of again.Poor Knox had two brothers in the regiment, and he was the
youngest of the three.He was a most deserving and popular
non-commissioned officer, decorated with the French war medal and the
Cross of the Legion of Honour for valour in the Crimea, and was about to
be promoted sergeant-major of the regiment, _vice_ Murray killed in the
Secundrabagh.About two o'clock in the afternoon, the regiment being all together
again, the following general order was read to us, and although this is
well-known history, still there must be many of the readers of these
reminiscences who have not ready access to histories.I will therefore
quote the general order in question for the information of young
soldiers.HEADQUARTERS, LA MARTINIERE, LUCKNOW, _23rd
      November, 1857_.The Commander-in-Chief has reason to be thankful to the
      force he conducted for the relief of the garrison of
      Lucknow.Hastily assembled, fatigued by forced marches, but
      animated by a common feeling of determination to accomplish
      the duty before them, all ranks of this force have
      compensated for their small number, in the execution of a
      most difficult duty, by unceasing exertions.From the morning of the 16th till last night the whole
      force has been one outlying piquet, never out of fire, and
      covering an immense extent of ground, to permit the garrison
      to retire scatheless and in safety covered by the whole of
      the relieving force.That ground was won by fighting as hard as it ever fell
      to the lot of the Commander-in-Chief to witness, it being
      necessary to bring up the same men over and over again to
      fresh attacks; and it is with the greatest gratification
      that his Excellency declares he never saw men behave better.The storming of the Secundrabagh and the Shah Nujeef has
      never been surpassed in daring, and the success of it was
      most brilliant and complete.The movement of retreat of last night, by which the final
      rescue of the garrison was effected, was a model of
      discipline and exactness.The consequence was that the enemy
      was completely deceived, and the force retired by a narrow,
      tortuous lane, the only line of retreat open, in the face of
      50,000 enemies, without molestation.The Commander-in-Chief offers his sincere thanks to
      Major-General Sir James Outram, G.C.B., for the happy manner
      in which he planned and carried out his arrangements for the
      evacuation of the Residency of Lucknow.By order of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
                                   W. MAYHEW, _Major_,
                        _Deputy Adjutant-General of the Army_.Thus were achieved the relief and evacuation of the Residency of
Lucknow.[26] The enemy did not discover that the Residency was deserted
till noon on the 23rd, and about the time the above general order was
being read to us they fired a salute of one hundred and one guns, but
did not attempt to follow us or to cut off our retreat.That night we
bivouacked in the Dilkoosha park, and retired on the Alumbagh on the
25th, the day on which the brave and gallant Havelock died.But that is
a well-known part of the history of the relief of Lucknow, and I will
turn to other matters.FOOTNOTES:

[25] It may be necessary to remind civilians that the rifles of 1857
were muzzle-loading.[26] It must always be recollected that this was the _second_ relief of
Lucknow.The first was effected by the force under Havelock and Outram
on the 25th September, 1857, and was in fact more of a reinforcement
than a relief.CHAPTER VII

BAGPIPES AT LUCKNOW--A BEWILDERED BABOO--THE FORCED MARCH TO
CAWNPORE--OPIUM--WYNDHAM'S MISTAKE


Since commencing these reminiscences, and more particularly during my
late visit to Lucknow and Cawnpore, I have been asked by several people
about the truth of the story of the Scotch girl and the bagpipes at
Lucknow, and in reply to all such inquiries I can only make the
following answer.About the time of the anniversary dinner in celebration of the relief of
Lucknow, in September, 1891, some writers in the English papers went so
far as to deny that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders had their bagpipes
with them at Lucknow, and in _The Calcutta Statesman_ of the 18th of
October, 1891, I wrote a letter contradicting this assertion, which with
the permission of the editor I propose to republish in this chapter.But
I may first mention that on my late visit to Lucknow a friend showed me
a copy of the original edition of _A Personal Narrative of the Siege of
Lucknow_, by L. E. R. Rees, one of the surviving defenders, which I had
never before seen, and on page 224 the following statement is given
regarding the entry of Havelock's force.After describing the prevailing
excitement the writer goes on to say: "The shrill tones of the
Highlanders' bagpipes now pierced our ears; not the most beautiful music
was ever more welcome or more joy-bringing," and so on.Further on, on
page 226: "The enemy found some of us dancing to the sounds of the
Highlanders' pipes.The remembrance of that happy evening will never be
effaced from my memory."While yet again, on page 237, he gives the
story related by me below about the Highland piper putting some of the
enemy's cavalry to flight by a blast from his pipes.So much in proof of
the fact that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders had their bagpipes with
them, and played them too, at the first relief of Lucknow.I must now devote a few remarks to the incident of Jessie Brown, which
Grace Campbell has immortalised in the song known as _Jessie's Dream_.In the _Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery Martin, vol.page 470,
after denying that this story had its origin in Lucknow, the author
gives the following foot-note: "It was originally a little romance,
written by a French governess at Jersey for the use of her pupils; which
found its way into a Paris paper, thence to the _Jersey Times_, thence
to the London _Times_, December 12th, 1857, and afterwards appeared in
nearly all the journals of the United Kingdom."With regard to this
remark, I am positive that I heard the story in Lucknow in November,
1857, at the same time as I heard the story about the piper frightening
the enemy's _sowars_ with his bagpipes; and it appears a rather
far-fetched theory about a French governess inventing the story in
Jersey.What was the name of this governess, and, above all, why go for
its origin to such an out-of-the-way place as Jersey?I doubt very much
if it was possible for the news of the relief of Lucknow to have reached
Jersey, and for the said French governess to have composed and printed
such a romance in time for its roundabout publication in _The Times_ of
the 12th of December, 1857.This version of the origin of _Jessie's
Dream_ therefore to my thinking carries its own refutation on the face
of it, and I should much like to see the story in its original French
form before I believe it.Be that as it may, in the letters published in the home papers, and
quoted in _The Calcutta Statesman_ in October, 1891, one lady gave the
positive statement of a certain Mrs.Gaffney, then living in London, who
asserted that she was, if I remember rightly, in the same compartment of
the Residency with Jessie Brown at the very time the latter said that
she heard the bagpipes when dull English ears could detect nothing
besides the accustomed roar of the cannon.Her husband, Sergeant Gaffney, served with me in the Commissariat
Department in Peshawur just after the Mutiny, and I was present as his
best man when he married Mrs.I forget now what was the name of
her first husband, but she was a widow when Sergeant Gaffney married
her.I think her first husband was a sergeant of the Company's
Artillery, who was either killed in the defence of the Residency or
died shortly after.Gaffney either in the end
of 1860 or beginning of 1861, and I have often heard her relate the
incident of Jessie Brown's hearing the bagpipes in the underground
cellar, or _tykhana_, of the Residency, hours before any one would
believe that a force was coming to their relief, when in the words of
J. B. S. Boyle, the garrison were repeating in dull despair the lines so
descriptive of their state:

    No news from the outer world!Days, weeks, and months have sped;
    Pent up within our battlements,
    We seem as living dead.Have British soldiers quailed
    Before the rebel mutineers?--
    Has British valour failed?If the foregoing facts do not convince my readers of the truth of the
origin of _Jessie's Dream_ I cannot give them any more.I am positive on
the point that the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders _had_ their bagpipes and
pipers with them in Lucknow, and that I first heard the story of
_Jessie's Dream_ on the 23rd of November, 1857, on the Dilkoosha heights
before Lucknow.The following is my letter of the 18th of October, 1891,
on the subject, addressed to the editor of _The Calcutta Statesman_.SIR,--In an issue of the _Statesman_ of last week
      there was a letter from Deputy-Inspector-General Joseph Jee,
      V.C., C.B., late of the Seventy-Eighth Highlanders
      (Ross-shire Buffs), recopied from an English paper,
      contradicting a report that had been published to the
      effect that the bagpipes of the Seventy-Eighth had been left
      behind at Cawnpore when the regiment went with General
      Havelock to the first relief of Lucknow; and I write to
      support the assertion of Deputy-Inspector-General Jee that
      if any late pipe-major or piper of the old Seventy-Eighth
      has ever made such an assertion, he must be mad!I was not
      in the Seventy-Eighth myself, but in the Ninety-Third, the
      regiment which saved the "Saviours of India" (as the
      Seventy-Eighth were then called), and rescued them from the
      Residency, and I am positive that the Seventy-Eighth had
      their bagpipes and pipers too inside the Residency; for I
      well remember they struck up the same tunes as the pipers of
      the Ninety-Third, on the memorable 16th of November, 1857.I
      recollect the fact as if it were only yesterday.When the
      din of battle had ceased for a time, and the roll of the
      Ninety-Third was being called outside the Secundrabagh to
      ascertain how many had fallen in that memorable combat,
      which Sir Colin Campbell said had "never been surpassed and
      rarely equalled," Pipe-Major John McLeod called me aside to
      listen to the pipers of the Seventy-Eighth, inside the
      Residency, playing _On wi' the Tartan_, and I could hear the
      pipes quite distinctly, although, except for the practised
      _lug_ of John McLeod, I could not have told the tune.However, I don't suppose there are many now living fitter to
      give evidence on the subject than Doctor Jee; but I may
      mention another incident.The morning after the Residency
      was evacuated, I visited the bivouac of the Seventy-Eighth
      near Dilkoosha, to make inquiries about an old school chum
      who had enlisted in the regiment.I found him still alive,
      and he related to me how he had been one of the men who were
      with Dr.Jee collecting the wounded in the streets of
      Lucknow on the 26th of September, and how they had been cut
      off from the main body and besieged in a house the whole
      night, and Dr.Jee was the only officer with the party, and
      that he had been recommended for the Victoria Cross for his
      bravery in defending the place and saving a large number of
      the wounded.I may mention another incident which my friend
      told me, and which has not been so much noticed as the
      Jessie Brown story.It was told to me as a fact at the time,
      and it afterwards appeared in a Glasgow newspaper.It was as
      follows: When Dr.Jee's detachment and the wounded were
      fighting their way to the Residency, a wounded piper and
      three others who had fired their last round of ammunition
      were charged by half-a-dozen rebel _sowars_[27] in a side
      street, and the three men with rifles prepared to defend
      themselves with the bayonet; but as soon as the _sowars_
      were within about twenty paces of the party, the piper
      pointed the drones of his bagpipes straight at them and blew
      such a wild blast that they turned tail and fled like the
      wind, mistaking the bagpipes for some infernal machine!But
      enough of Lucknow.Who
      ever heard of a Highland regiment going into action without
      their bagpipes and pipers, unless the latter were all
      "kilt"?No officer who ever commanded Highlanders knew the
      worth of a good piper better than Colonel John Cameron, "the
      grandson of Lochiel, the valiant Fassifern."And is there a
      Highland soldier worthy of the name who has not heard of his
      famous favourite piper who was shot at Cameron's side when
      playing the charge, while crossing the Nive in face of the
      French?The historian of the Peninsula war relates: "When
      the Ninety-Second Highlanders were in the middle of the
      stream, Colonel Cameron's favourite piper was shot by his
      side.Stooping from his saddle, Fassifern tried to rescue
      the body of the man who had so often cheered the regiment to
      victory, but in vain: the lifeless corpse was swept away by
      the torrent.cried the brave Cameron, dashing the
      tears from his eyes, 'I would rather have lost twenty
      grenadiers than you.'"Let us next turn to McDonald's
      _Martial Music of Scotland_, and we read: "The bagpipes are
      sacred to Scotland and speak a language which Scotchmen only
      know, and inspire feelings which Scotchmen only feel.Need
      it be told to how many fields of danger and victory the
      warlike strains of the bagpipes have led?There is not a
      battlefield that is honourable to Britain where their
      war-blast has not sounded!When every other instrument has
      been silenced by the confusion and the carnage of the scene,
      the bagpipes have been borne into the thick of battle, and
      many a devoted piper has sounded at once encouragement to
      his clansmen and his own _coronach_!"In the garb of old Gaul, with the fire of old Rome,
    From the heath-covered mountains of Scotia we come;
    Our loud-sounding pipe breathes the true martial strain,
    And our hearts still the old Scottish valour retain.We rested at the Alumbagh on the 26th of November, but early on the 27th
we understood something had gone wrong in our rear, because, as usual
with Sir Colin when he contemplated a forced march, we were served out
with three days' rations and double ammunition,--sixty rounds in our
pouches and sixty in our haversacks; and by two o'clock in the afternoon
the whole of the women and children, all the sick and wounded, in every
conceivable kind of conveyance, were in full retreat towards Cawnpore.General Outram's Division being made up to four thousand men was left in
the Alumbagh to hold the enemy in check, and to show them that Lucknow
was not abandoned, while three thousand fighting men, to guard over two
thousand women and children, sick and wounded, commenced their march
southwards.So far as I can remember the Third and Fifth Punjab Infantry
formed the infantry of the advance-guard; the Ninth Lancers and Horse
Artillery supplied the flanking parties; while the rear guard, being the
post of honour, was given to the Ninety-Third, a troop of the Ninth
Lancers and Bourchier's light field-battery, No.17 of the Honourable
East India Company's artillery.We started from the Alumbagh late in the
afternoon, and reached Bunnee Bridge, seventeen miles from Lucknow,
about 11 P.M.Here the regiment halted till daylight on the
morning of the 28th of November, but the advance-guard with the women
and children, sick and wounded, had been moving since 2 A.M.As already mentioned, all the subaltern officers in my company were
wounded, and I was told off, with a guard of about twenty men, to see
all the baggage-carts across Bunnee Bridge and on their way to Cawnpore.While I was on this duty an amusing incident happened.A commissariat
cart, a common country hackery, loaded with biscuits, got upset, and its
wheel broke just as we were moving it on to the road.The only person
near it belonging to the Commissariat Department was a young _baboo_
named Hera Lall Chatterjee, a boy of about seventeen or eighteen years
of age, who defended his charge as long as he could, but he was soon put
on one side, the biscuits-bags were ripped open, and the men commenced
filling their haversacks from them.Just at this time, an escort of the
Ninth Lancers, with some staff-officers, rode up from the rear.It was
the Commander-in-Chief and his staff.Hera Lall seeing him rushed up and
called out: "O my Lord, you are my father and my mother!These wild Highlanders will not hear me, but are stealing
commissariat biscuits like fine fun."Sir Colin pulled up, and asked the
_baboo_ if there was no officer present; to which Hera Lall replied, "No
officer, sir, only one corporal, and he tell me, 'Shut up, or I'll shoot
you, same like rebel mutineer!'"Hearing this I stepped out of the crowd
and saluting Sir Colin, told him that all the officers of my company
were wounded except Captain Dawson, who was in front; that I and a party
of men had been left to see the last of the carts on to the road; that
this cart had broken down, and as there was no other means of carrying
the biscuits, the men had filled their haversacks with them rather than
leave them on the ground.On hearing that, Hera Lall again came to the
front with clasped hands, saying: "O my Lord, if one cart of biscuits
short, Major Fitzgerald not listen to me, but will order thirty lashes
with provost-marshal's cat!What can a poor _baboo_ do with such wild
Highlanders?"Sir Colin replied: "Yes, _baboo_, I know these Highlanders
are very wild fellows when hungry; let them have the biscuits;" and
turning to one of the staff, he directed him to give a voucher to the
_baboo_ that a cart loaded with biscuits had broken down and the
contents had been divided among the rear-guard by order of the
Commander-in-Chief.Sir Colin then turned to us and said: "Men, I give
you the biscuits; divide them with your comrades in front; but you must
promise me should a cart loaded with rum break down, you will not
interfere with it."We all replied: "No, no, Sir Colin, if rum breaks
down we'll not touch it.""All right," said Sir Colin, "remember I trust
you," and looking round he said, "I know every one of you," and rode on.We very soon found room for the biscuits, until we got up to the rest of
the company, when we honestly shared them.I may add that _baboo_ Hera
Lall Chatterjee is still living, and is the only native employe I know
who served through the second relief of Lucknow.He now holds the post
of cashier in the offices of Messrs.McNeill and Co., of Clive Ghat
Street, Calcutta, which doubtless he finds more congenial employment
than defending commissariat stores from hungry wild Highlanders, with
the prospect of the provost-marshal's cat as the only reward for doing
his best to defend his charge.About five miles farther on a general halt was made for a short rest and
for all stragglers to come up.Sir Colin himself, being still with the
column, ordered the Ninety-Third to form up, and, calling the officers
to the front, he made the first announcement to the regiment that
General Wyndham had been attacked by the Nana Sahib and the Gwalior
Contingent in Cawnpore; that his force had been obliged to retire within
the fort at the head of the bridge of boats, and that we must reach
Cawnpore that night, because, if the bridge of boats should be captured
before we got there, we would be cut off in Oude with fifty thousand of
our enemies in our rear, a well-equipped army of forty thousand men,
with a powerful train of artillery numbering over forty siege guns, in
our front, and with all the women and children, sick and wounded, to
guard."So, Ninety-Third," said the grand old Chief, "I don't ask you to
undertake this forced march, in your present tired condition, without
good reason.You must reach Cawnpore to-night at all costs."And, as
usual, when he took the men into his confidence, he was answered from
the ranks, "All right, Sir Colin, we'll do it."To which he replied,
"Very well, Ninety-Third, remember I depend on you."And he and his
staff and escort rode on.By this time we could plainly hear the guns of the Gwalior Contingent
bombarding General Wyndham's position in Cawnpore; and although terribly
footsore and tired, not having had our clothes off, nor a change of
socks, since the 10th of the month (now eighteen days) we trudged on our
weary march, every mile making the roar of the guns in front more
audible.I may remark here that there is nothing to rouse tired soldiers
like a good cannonade in front; it is the best tonic out!Even the
youngest soldier who has once been under fire, and can distinguish the
sound of a shotted gun from blank, pricks up his ears at the sound and
steps out with a firmer tread and a more erect bearing.I shall never forget the misery of that march!However, we reached the
sands on the banks of the Ganges, on the Oude side of the river opposite
Cawnpore, just as the sun was setting, having covered the forty-seven
miles under thirty hours.Of course the great hardship of the march was
caused by our worn-out state after eighteen days' continual duty,
without a change of clothes or our accoutrements off.And when we got in
sight of Cawnpore, the first thing we saw was the enemy on the opposite
side of the river from us, making bonfires of our spare kits and baggage
which had been left at Cawnpore when we advanced for the relief of
Lucknow!Tired as we were, we assisted to drag Peel's heavy guns into
position on the banks of the river, whence the Blue-jackets opened fire
on the left flank of the enemy, the bonfires of our spare baggage being
a fine mark for them.Just as the Nana Sahib had got his first gun to bear on the bridge of
boats, that gun was struck on the side by one of Peel's 24-pounders and
upset, and an 8-inch shell from one of his howitzers bursting in the
midst of a crowd of them, we could see them bolting helter-skelter.This put a stop to their game for the night, and we lay down and rested
on the sands till daybreak next morning, the 29th of November.I must mention here an experience of my own which I always recall to
mind when I read some of the insane ravings of the Anti-Opium Society
against the use of that drug.I was so completely tired out by that
terrible march that after I had lain down for about half an hour I
positively could not stand up, I was so stiff and worn out.Having been
on duty as orderly corporal before leaving the Alumbagh, I had been much
longer on my feet than the rest of the men; in fact, I was tired out
before we started on our march on the afternoon of the 27th, and now,
after having covered forty-seven miles under thirty hours, my condition
can be better imagined than described.After I became cold, I grew so
stiff that I positively could not use my legs.Now Captain Dawson had a
native servant, an old man named Hyder Khan, who had been an officers'
servant all his life, and had been through many campaigns.I had made a
friend of old Hyder before we left Chinsurah, and he did not forget me.Having ridden the greater part of the march on the camel carrying his
master's baggage, Hyder was comparatively fresh when he got into camp,
and about the time our canteen-sergeant got up and was calling for
orderly-corporals to draw grog for the men, old Hyder came looking for
me, and when he saw my tired state, he said, in his camp English:
"Corporal _sahib_, you God-damn tired; don't drink grog.Old Hyder give
you something damn much better than grog for tired mans."With that he
went away, but shortly after returned, and gave me a small pill, which
he told me was opium, and about half a pint of hot tea, which he had
prepared for himself and his master.I swallowed the pill and drank the
tea, and _in less than ten minutes_ I felt myself so much refreshed as
to be able to get up and draw the grog for the men of the company and to
serve it out to them while the colour-sergeant called the roll.I then
lay down, rolled up in my sepoy officer's quilt, which I had carried
from the Shah Nujeef, and had a sound refreshing sleep till next
morning, and then got up so much restored that, except for the sores on
my feet from broken blisters, I could have undertaken another forty-mile
march.I always recall this experience when I read many of the ignorant
arguments of the Anti-Opium Society, who would, if they had the power,
compel the Government to deprive every hard-worked _coolie_ of the only
solace in his life of toil.I am certainly not an opium-eater, and the
abuse of opium may be injurious, as is the abuse of anything; but I am
so convinced in my own mind of the beneficial effects of the temperate
use of the drug, that if I were the general of an army after a forced
march like that of the retreat from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, I
would make the Medical Department give every man a pill of opium and
half a pint of hot tea, instead of rum or liquor of any sort!I hate
drunkenness as much as anybody, but I have no sympathy with what I may
call the intemperate temperance of most of our teetotallers and the
Anti-Opium Society.My experience has been as great and as varied as
that of most Europeans in India, and that experience has led me to the
conviction that the members of the Anti-Opium Society are either
culpably ignorant of facts, or dishonest in the way they represent what
they wish others to believe to be facts.Most of the assertions made
about the Government connection with opium being a hindrance to
mission-work and the spread of Christianity, are gross exaggerations not
borne out by experience, and the opium slave and the opium den, as
depicted in much of the literature on this subject, have no existence
except in the distorted imagination of the writers.But I shall have
some more observations to make on this score elsewhere, and some
evidence to bring forward in support of them.[28]

Early on the morning of the 29th of November the Ninety-Third crossed
the bridge of boats, and it was well that Sir Colin had returned so
promptly from Lucknow to the relief of Cawnpore, for General Wyndham's
troops were not only beaten and cowed,--they were utterly demoralised.When the Commander-in-Chief left Cawnpore for Lucknow, General Wyndham,
known as the "Hero of the Redan," was left in command at Cawnpore with
instructions to strengthen his position by every means, and to detain
all detachments arriving from Calcutta after the 10th of November,
because it was known that the Gwalior Contingent were in great force
somewhere across the Jumna, and there was every probability that they
would either attack Cawnpore, or cross into Oude to fall on the rear of
the Commander-in-Chief's force to prevent the relief of Lucknow.But
strict orders were given to General Wyndham that he was _on no account_
to move out of Cawnpore, should the Gwalior Contingent advance on his
position, but to act on the defensive, and to hold his entrenchments and
guard the bridge of boats at all hazards.By that time the entrenchment
or mud fort at the Cawnpore end of the bridge, where the Government
Harness and Saddlery Factory now stands, had become a place of
considerable strength under the able direction of Captain Mowbray
Thomson, one of the four survivors of General Wheeler's force.Captain
Thomson had over four thousand _coolies_ daily employed on the defences
from daybreak till dark, and he was a most energetic officer himself, so
that by the time we passed through Cawnpore for the relief of Lucknow
this position had become quite a strong fortification, especially when
compared with the miserable apology for an entrenchment so gallantly
defended by General Wheeler's small force and won from him by such black
treachery.When we advanced for the relief of Lucknow, all our spare
baggage, five hundred new tents, and a great quantity of clothing for
the troops coming down from Delhi, were shut up in Cawnpore, with a
large quantity of spare ammunition, harness, and saddlery; in brief,
property to the value of over five _lakhs_ of rupees was left stored in
the church and in the houses which were still standing near the church
between the town and the river, a short distance from the house in which
the women and children were murdered.All this property, as already
mentioned, fell into the hands of the Gwalior Contingent, and we
returned just in time to see them making bonfires of what they could not
use.Colonel Sir Robert Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala) lost
all the records of his long service, and many valuable engineering
papers which could never be replaced.As for us of the Ninety-Third, we
lost all our spare kits, and were now without a chance of a change of
underclothing or socks.Let all who may read this consider what it meant
to us, who had not changed our clothes from the 10th of the month, and
how, on the morning of the 29th, the sight of the enemy making bonfires
of our kits, just as we were within reach of them, could hardly have
been soothing to contemplate.But to return to General Wyndham's force.By the 26th of November it
numbered two thousand four hundred men, according to Colonel Adye's
_Defence of Cawnpore_; and when he heard of the advance of the Nana
Sahib at the head of the Gwalior Contingent, Wyndham considered himself
strong enough to disobey the orders of the Commander-in-Chief, and moved
out of his entrenchment to give them battle, encountering their advance
guard at Pandoo Nuddee about seven miles from Cawnpore.He at once
attacked and drove it back through a village in its rear; but behind
the village he found himself confronted by an army of over forty
thousand men, twenty-five thousand of them being the famous Gwalior
Contingent, the best disciplined troops in India, which had never been
beaten and considered themselves invincible, and which, in addition to a
siege train of thirty heavy guns, 24 and 32-pounders, had a
well-appointed and well-drilled field-artillery.General Wyndham now saw
his mistake, and gave the order for retreat.His small force retired in
good order, and encamped on the plain outside Cawnpore on the Bithoor
road for the night, to find itself outflanked and almost surrounded by
Tantia Topee and his Mahrattas on the morning of the 27th; and at the
end of five hours' fighting a general retreat into the fort had again to
be ordered.The retiring force was overwhelmed by a murderous cannonade, and, being
largely composed of young soldiers, a panic ensued.The men got out of
hand, and fled for the fort with a loss of over three hundred,--mostly
killed, because the wounded who fell into the hands of the enemy were
cut to pieces,--and several guns.Moore, Church of England
Chaplain with General Wyndham's force, gave a very sad picture of the
panic in which the men fled for the fort, and his description was borne
out by what I saw myself when we passed through the fort on the morning
of the 29th.Moore said: "The men got quite out of hand and fled
pell-mell for the fort.An old Sikh _sirdar_ at the gate tried to stop
them, and to form them up in some order, and when they pushed him aside
and rushed past him, he lifted up his hands and said, 'You are not the
brothers of the men who beat the Khalsa army and conquered the Punjab!'"Moore went on to say that, "The old Sikh followed the flying men
through the Fort Gate, and patting some of them on the back said, 'Don't
run, don't be afraid, there is nothing to hurt you!'"The fact is the
men were mostly young soldiers, belonging to many different regiments,
simply battalions of detachments.They were crushed by the heavy and
well-served artillery of the enemy, and if the truth must be told, they
had no confidence in their commander, who was a brave soldier, but no
general; so when the men were once seized with panic, there was no
stopping them.The only regiment, or rather part of a regiment, for they
only numbered fourteen officers of all ranks and a hundred and sixty
men, which behaved well, was the old Sixty-Fourth, and two companies of
the Thirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second, making up a weak battalion of
barely three hundred.This was led by brave old Brigadier Wilson, who
held them in hand until he brought them forward to cover the retreat,
which he did with a loss of seven officers killed and two wounded,
eighteen men of the Sixty-Fourth killed and twenty-five wounded, with
equally heavy proportions killed and wounded from the companies of the
Thirty-Fourth and Eighty-Second.Brigadier Wilson first had his horse
shot, and was then himself killed, while urging the men to maintain the
honour of the regiment.The command then devolved on Major Stirling,
one of the Sixty-Fourth, who was cut down in the act of spiking one of
the enemy's guns, and Captain M'Crea of the same regiment was also cut
down just as he had spiked his fourth gun.This charge, and these
individual acts of bravery, retarded the advance of the enemy till some
sort of order had been re-established inside the fort.The Sixty-Fourth
were then driven back, and obliged to leave their dead.This then was the state of matters when we reached Cawnpore from
Lucknow.The whole of our spare baggage was captured: the city of
Cawnpore and the whole of the river-side up to the house where the Nana
had slaughtered the women and children were in the hands of the enemy;
but they had not yet injured the bridge of boats, nor crossed the canal,
and the road to Allahabad still remained open.We marched through the fort, and took up ground near where the jute mill
of Messrs.We
crossed the bridge without any loss except one officer, who was slightly
wounded by being struck on the shin by a spent bullet from a charge of
grape.He was a long slender youth of about sixteen or seventeen years
of age, whom the men had named "Jack Straw."He was knocked down just as
we cleared the bridge of boats, among the blood of some camp-followers
who had been killed by the bursting of a shell just in front of us.Sergeant Paton, of my company, picked him up, and put him into an empty
_dooly_ which was passing.During the day a piquet of one sergeant, one corporal, and about twenty
men, under command of Lieutenant Stirling, who was afterwards killed on
the 5th of December, was sent out to bring in the body of Brigadier
Wilson, and a man named Doran, of the Sixty-Fourth, who had gone up to
Lucknow in the Volunteer Cavalry, and had there done good service and
returned with our force, volunteered to go out with them to identify the
brigadier's body, because there were many more killed near the same
place, and their corpses having been stripped, they could not be
identified by their uniform, and it would have been impossible to have
brought in all without serious loss.The party reached the brigadier's
body without apparently attracting the attention of the enemy; but just
as two men, Rule of my regiment and Patrick Doran, were lifting it into
the _dooly_ they were seen, and the enemy opened fire on them.A bullet
struck Doran and went right through his body from side to side, without
touching any of the vital organs, just as he was bending down to lift
the brigadier--a most extraordinary wound!If the bullet had deviated a
hair's-breadth to either side, the wound must have been mortal, but
Doran was able to walk back to the fort, and lived for many years after
taking his discharge from the regiment.During the time that this piquet was engaged the Blue-jackets of Peel's
Brigade and our heavy artillery had taken up positions in front of the
fort, and showed the gunners of the Gwalior Contingent that they were no
longer confronted by raw inexperienced troops.By the afternoon of the
29th of November, the whole of the women and children and sick and
wounded from Lucknow had crossed the Ganges, and encamped behind the
Ninety-Third on the Allahabad road, and here I will leave them and close
this chapter.FOOTNOTES:

CHAPTER VIII

ANECDOTES--ACTION WITH THE GWALIOR CONTINGENT--ITS DEFEAT--PURSUIT OF
THE NANA--BITHOOR--JOHN LANG AND JOTEE PERSHAD


So far as I now remember, the 30th of November, 1857, passed without any
movement on the part of the enemy, and the Commander-in-Chief, in his
letter describing the state of affairs to the Governor-General, said, "I
am obliged to submit to the hostile occupation of Cawnpore until the
actual despatch of all my incumbrances towards Allahabad is effected."As stated in the last chapter, when our tents came up our camp was
pitched (as near as I can now make out from the altered state of
Cawnpore), about the spot where Joe Lee's hotel and the jute mill of
Messrs.Andrew's day and evening
passed without molestation, except that strong piquets lined the canal
and guarded our left and rear from surprise, and the men in camp slept
accoutred, ready to turn out at the least alarm.But during the night,
or early on the morning of the 1st of December, the enemy had quietly
advanced some guns, unseen by our piquets, right up to the Cawnpore side
of the canal, and suddenly opened fire on the Ninety-Third just as we
were falling in for muster-parade, sending round-shot and shell right
through our tents.One shrapnel shell burst right in the centre of
Captain Cornwall's company severely wounding the captain,
Colour-Sergeant M'Intyre, and five men, but not killing any one.Captain Cornwall was the oldest officer in the regiment, even an older
soldier than Colonel Leith-Hay who had then commanded it for over three
years, and for long he had been named by the men "Old Daddy Cornwall."He was poor, and had been unable to purchase promotion, and in
consequence was still a captain with over thirty-five years' service.The bursting of the shell right over his head stunned the old gentleman,
and a bullet from it went through his shoulder breaking his collar-bone
and cutting a deep furrow down his back.The old man was rather stout
and very short-sighted; the shock of the fall stunned him for some time,
and before he regained his senses Dr.Munro had cut the bullet out of
his back and bandaged up his wound as well as possible.Daddy came to
himself just as the men were lifting him into a _dooly_.Munro standing by with the bullet in his hand, about to present it to
him as a memento of Cawnpore, Daddy gasped out, "Munro, is my wound
dangerous?""No, Cornwall," was the answer, "not if you don't excite
yourself into a fever; you will get over it all right."The next
question put was, "Is the road clear to Allahabad?"To which Munro
replied that it was, and that he hoped to have all the sick and wounded
sent down country within a day or two."Then by----" said Daddy, with
considerable emphasis, "I'm off."The poor old fellow had through long
disappointment become like our soldiers in Flanders,--he sometimes
swore; but considering how promotion had passed over him, that was
perhaps excusable.All this occupied far less time than it takes to
write it, and I may as well here finish the history of Daddy Cornwall
before I leave him.He went home in the same vessel as a rich widow,
whom he married on arrival in Dublin, his native place, the corporation
of which presented him with a valuable sword and the freedom of the
city.The death of Brigadier-General Hope in the following April gave
Captain Cornwall his majority without purchase, and he returned to India
in the end of 1859 to command the regiment for about nine months,
retiring from the army in 1860, when we lay at Rawul Pindee.Being shelled out of our tents, the
regiment was advanced to the side of the canal under cover of the mud
walls of what had formerly been the sepoy lines, in which we took
shelter from the fire of the enemy.Later in the day Colonel Ewart lost
his left arm by a round-shot striking him on the elbow just as he had
dismounted from his charger on his return from visiting the piquets on
the left and rear of our position, he being the field-officer for the
day.This caused universal regret in the regiment, Ewart being the most
popular officer in it.By the evening of the 3rd of December the whole of the women and
children, and as many of the wounded as could bear to be moved, were on
their way to Allahabad; and during the 4th and 5th reinforcements
reached Cawnpore from England, among them our old comrades of the
Forty-Second whom we had left at Dover in May.We were right glad to see
them, on the morning of the 5th December, marching in with bagpipes
playing, which was the first intimation we had of another Highland
regiment being near us.These reinforcements raised the force under Sir
Colin Campbell to five thousand infantry, six hundred cavalry, and
thirty-five guns.Early on the morning of the 6th of December we struck our tents, which
were loaded on elephants, and marched to a place of safety behind the
fort on the river bank, whilst we formed up in rear of the unroofed
barracks--the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninety-Third, and Fourth Punjab
Infantry, with Peel's Brigade and several batteries of artillery, among
them Colonel Bourchier's light field-battery (No.17 of the old
Company's European artillery), a most daring lot of fellows, the Ninth
Lancers, and one squadron of Hodson's Horse under command of Lieutenant
Gough,[29] a worthy pupil of a famous master.This detachment of
Hodson's Horse had come down with Sir Hope Grant from Delhi, and served
at the final relief of Lucknow and the retreat to the succour of
Cawnpore.The headquarters of the regiment under its famous commander
had been left with Brigadier Showers.As this force was formed up in columns, masked from the view of the
enemy by the barracks on the plain of Cawnpore, the Commander-in-Chief
rode up, and told us that he had just got a telegram informing him of
the safe arrival of the women and children, sick and wounded, at
Allahabad, and that now we were to give battle to the famous Gwalior
Contingent, consisting of twenty-five thousand well-disciplined troops,
with about ten thousand of the Nana Sahib's Mahrattas and all the
_budmashes_ of Cawnpore, Calpee, and Gwalior, under command of the Nana
in person, who had proclaimed himself Peishwa and Chief of the Mahratta
power, with Tantia Topee, Bala Sahib (the Nana's brother), and Raja Koor
Sing, the Rajpoot Chief of Judgdespore, as divisional commanders, and
with all the native officers of the Gwalior Contingent as brigade and
regimental commanders.Sir Colin also warned us that there was a large
quantity of rum in the enemy's camp, which we must carefully avoid,
because it was reported to have been drugged."But, Ninety-Third," he
continued, "I trust you.The supernumerary rank will see that no man
breaks the ranks, and I have ordered the rum to be destroyed as soon as
the camp is taken."The Chief then rode on to the other regiments and as soon as he had
addressed a short speech to each, a signal was sent up from Peel's
rocket battery, and General Wyndham opened the ball on his side with
every gun at his disposal, attacking the enemy's left between the city
and the river.Sir Colin himself led the advance, the Fifty-Third and
Fourth Punjab Infantry in skirmishing order, with the Ninety-Third in
line, the cavalry on our left, and Peel's guns and the horse-artillery
at intervals, with the Forty-Second in the second line for our support.Directly we emerged from the shelter of the buildings which had masked
our formation, the piquets fell back, the skirmishers advanced at the
double, and the enemy opened a tremendous cannonade on us with
round-shot, shell, and grape.But, nothing daunted, our skirmishers soon
lined the canal, and our line advanced, with the pipers playing and the
colours in front of the centre company, without the least
wavering,--except now and then opening out to let through the round-shot
which were falling in front, and rebounding along the hard
ground-determined to show the Gwalior Contingent that they had different
men to meet from those whom they had encountered under Wyndham a week
before.By the time we reached the canal, Peel's Blue-jackets were
calling out--"Damn these cow horses," meaning the gun-bullocks, "they're
too slow!Come, you Ninety-Third, give us a hand with the drag-ropes as
you did at Lucknow!"We were then well under the range of the enemy's
guns, and the excitement was at its height.A company of the
Ninety-Third slung their rifles, and dashed to the assistance of the
Blue-jackets.The bullocks were cast adrift, and the native drivers were
not slow in going to the rear.The drag-ropes were manned, and the
24-pounders wheeled abreast of the first line of skirmishers just as if
they had been light field-pieces.When we reached the bank the infantry paused for a moment to see if the
canal could be forded or if we should have to cross by the bridge over
which the light field-battery were passing at the gallop, and
unlimbering and opening fire, as soon as they cleared the head of the
bridge, to protect our advance.At this juncture the enemy opened on us
with grape and canister shot, but they fired high and did us but little
damage.As the peculiar _whish_ (a sound when once heard never to be
forgotten) of the grape was going over our heads, the Blue-jackets gave
a ringing cheer for the "Red, white, and blue!"While the Ninety-Third,
led off by Sergeant Daniel White, struck up _The Battle of the Alma_, a
song composed in the Crimea by Corporal John Brown of the Grenadier
Guards, and often sung round the camp-fires in front of Sebastopol.I
here give the words, not for their literary merit, but to show the
spirit of the men who could thus sing going into action in the teeth of
the fire of thirty well-served, although not very correctly-aimed guns,
to encounter a force of more than ten to one.Just as the Blue-jackets
gave their hurrah for the "Red, white, and blue," Dan White struck up
the song, and the whole line, including the skirmishers of the
Fifty-Third and the sailors, joined in the stirring patriotic tune,
which is a first-rate quick march:

    Come, all you gallant British hearts
      Who love the Red and Blue,[30]
    Come, drink a health to those brave lads
      Who made the Russians rue.Fill up your glass and let it pass,
      Three cheers, and one cheer more,
    For the fourteenth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We sailed from Kalimita Bay,
      And soon we made the coast,
    Determined we would do our best
      In spite of brag and boast.We sprang to land upon the strand,
      And slept on Russian shore,
    On the fourteenth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We marched along until we came
      Upon the Alma's banks,
    We halted just beneath their guns
      To breathe and close our ranks.we heard, and at the word
      Right through the brook we bore,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.We scrambled through the clustering vines,
      Then came the battle's brunt;
    Our officers, they cheered us on,
      Our colours waved in front;
    And fighting well full many fell,
      Alas!to rise no more,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.The French were on the right that day,
      And flanked the Russian line,
    While full upon their left they saw
      The British bayonets shine.With hearty cheers we stunned their ears,
      Amidst the cannon's roar,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A picnic party Menschikoff
      Had asked to see the fun;
    The ladies came at twelve o'clock
      To see the battle won.They found the day too hot to stay,
      The Prince felt rather sore,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.For when he called his carriage up,
      The French came up likewise;
    And so he took French leave at once
      And left to them the prize.The Chasseurs took his pocket-book,
      They even sacked his store,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.A letter to Old Nick they found,
      And this was what it said:
    "To meet their bravest men, my liege,
      Your soldiers do not dread;
    But devils they, not mortal men,"
      The Russian General swore,
    "That drove us off the Alma's heights
      In September, fifty-four."Long life to Royal Cambridge,
      To Peel and Camperdown,
    And all the gallant British Tars
      Who shared the great renown,
    Who stunned Russian ears with British cheers,
      Amidst the cannon's roar,
    On the twentieth of September,
      Eighteen hundred and fifty-four.Here's a health to noble Raglan,
      To Campbell and to Brown,
    And all the gallant Frenchmen
      Who shared that day's renown.Whilst we displayed the black cockade,
      They the tricolour bore;
    The Russian crew wore gray and blue
      In September, fifty-four.Come, let us drink a toast to-night,
      Our glasses take in hand,
    And all around this festive board
      In solemn silence stand.Before we part let each true heart
      Drink once to those no more,
    Who fought their last fight on Alma's height
      In September, fifty-four!Around our bivouac fires that night as _The Battle of the Alma_ was sung
again, Daniel White told us that when the Blue-jackets commenced
cheering under the hail of grape-shot, he remembered that the Scots
Greys and Ninety-Second Highlanders had charged at Waterloo singing
_Bruce's Address at Bannockburn_, "Scots wha hae," and trying to think
of something equally appropriate in which Peel's Brigade might join, he
could not at the moment recall anything better than the old Crimean song
aforesaid.After clearing the canal and re-forming our ranks, we came under shelter
of a range of brick kilns behind which stood the camp of the enemy, and
behind the camp their infantry were drawn up in columns, not deployed in
line.The rum against which Sir Colin had warned us was in front of the
camp, casks standing on end with the heads knocked out for convenience;
and there is no doubt but the enemy expected the Europeans would break
their ranks when they saw the rum, and had formed up their columns to
fall on us in the event of such a contingency.But the Ninety-Third
marched right on past the rum barrels, and the supernumerary rank soon
upset the casks, leaving the contents to soak into the dry ground.As soon as we cleared the camp, our line of infantry was halted.Up to
that time, except the skirmishers, we had not fired a shot, and we could
not understand the reason of the halt till we saw the Ninth Lancers and
the detachment of Hodson's Horse galloping round some fields of tall
sugar-cane on the left, masking the light field-battery.When the enemy
saw the tips of the lances (they evidently did not see the guns) they
quickly formed squares of brigades.They were armed with the old musket,
"Brown Bess," and did not open fire till the cavalry were within about
three hundred yards.Just as they commenced to fire, we could hear Sir
Hope Grant, in a voice as loud as a trumpet, give the command to the
cavalry, "Squadrons, outwards!"while Bourchier gave the order to his
gunners, "Action, front!"The cavalry wheeled as if they had been at a
review on the Calcutta parade-ground; the guns, having previously been
charged with grape, were swung round, unlimbered as quick as lightning
within about two hundred and fifty yards of the squares, and round after
round of grape was poured into the enemy with murderous effect, every
charge going right through, leaving a lane of dead from four to five
yards wide.By this time our line was advanced close up behind the
battery, and we could see the mounted officers of the enemy, as soon as
they caught sight of the guns, dash out of the squares and fly like
lightning across the plain.Directly the squares were broken, our
cavalry charged, while the infantry advanced at the double with the
bayonet.The battle was won, and the famous Gwalior Contingent was a
flying rabble, although the struggle was protracted in a series of
hand-to-hand fights all over the plain, no quarter being given.Peel's
guns were wheeled up, as already mentioned, as if they had been
6-pounders, and the left wing of the enemy taken in rear and their
retreat on the Calpee road cut off.What escaped of their right wing
fled along this road.The cavalry and horse-artillery led by Sir Colin
Campbell in person, the whole of the Fifty-Third, the Fourth Punjab
Infantry, and two companies of the Ninety-Third, pursued the flying mass
for fourteen miles.The rebels, being cut down by hundreds wherever they
attempted to rally for a stand, at length threw away their arms and
accoutrements to expedite their flight, for none were spared,--"neither
the sick man in his weakness, nor the strong man in his strength," to
quote the words of Colonel Alison.The evening closed with the total
rout of the enemy, and the capture of his camp, the whole of his
ordnance-park, containing a large quantity of ammunition and thirty-two
guns of sizes, siege-train, and field-artillery, with a loss of only
ninety-nine killed and wounded on our side.As night fell, large bodies of the left wing of the enemy were seen
retreating from the city between our piquets and the Ganges, but we were
too weary and too few in number to intercept them, and they retired
along the Bithoor road.About midnight the force which had followed the
enemy along the Calpee road returned, bringing in a large number of
ammunition-waggons and baggage-carts, the bullocks driven by our men,
and those not engaged in driving sitting on the waggons or carts, too
tired and footsore to walk.We rested hungry and exhausted, but a man of
my company, named Bill Summers, captured a little pack-bullock loaded
with two bales of stuff which turned out to be fine soft woollen socks
of Loodiana manufacture, sufficient to give every man in the company
three pairs,--a real godsend for us, since at that moment there was
nothing we stood more in need of than socks; and as no commissariat had
come up from the rear, we slaughtered the bullock and cut it into
steaks, which we broiled on the tips of our ramrods around the bivouac
fires.Thus we passed the night of the 6th of December, 1857.Early on the morning of the 7th a force was sent into the city of
Cawnpore, and patrolled it from end to end, east, west, north, and
south.Not only did we meet no enemy, but many of the townspeople
brought out food and water to our men, appearing very glad to see us.During the afternoon our tents came up from the rear, and were pitched
by the side of the Grand Trunk road, and the Forty-Second being put on
duty that night, we of the Fifty-Third and Ninety-Third were allowed to
take our accoutrements off for the first night's sleep without them
since the 10th of November--seven and twenty days!Our spare kits
having all vanished with the enemy, as told in the last chapter, our
quarter-master collected from the captured baggage all the underclothing
and socks he could lay hands on.Thanks to Bill Summers and the little
pack-bullock, my company got a change of socks; but there was more work
before us before we got a bath or a change of shirts.About noon on the 8th the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by Sir Hope
Grant and Brigadier Adrian Hope, had our brigade turned out, and as soon
as Sir Colin rode in among us we knew there was work to be done.He
called the officers to the front, and addressing them in the hearing of
the men, told them that the Nana Sahib had passed through Bithoor with a
large number of men and seventeen guns, and that we must all prepare for
another forced march to overtake him and capture these guns before he
could either reach Futtehghur or cross into Oude with them.After
stating that the camp would be struck as soon as we had got our dinners,
the Commander-in-Chief and Sir Hope Grant held a short but animated
conversation, which I have always thought was a prearranged matter
between them for our encouragement.In the full hearing of the men, Sir
Hope Grant turned to the Commander-in-Chief, and said, in rather a loud
tone: "I'm afraid, your Excellency, this march will prove a wild-goose
chase, because the infantry, in their present tired state, will never be
able to keep up with the cavalry."On this, Sir Colin turned round in
his saddle, and looking straight at us, replied in a tone equally loud,
so as to be heard by all the men: "I tell you, General Grant, you are
wrong.You don't know these men; these Highlanders will march your
cavalry blind."And turning to the men, as if expecting to be
corroborated by them, he was answered by over a dozen voices, "Ay, ay,
Sir Colin, we'll show them what we can do!"As soon as dinner was over we struck tents, loaded them on the
elephants, and by two o'clock P.M.were on the march along the Grand
Trunk road.By sunset we had covered fifteen miles from Cawnpore.Here
we halted, lit fires, cooked tea, served out grog, and after a rest of
three hours, to feed and water the horses as much as to rest the men, we
were off again.on the 9th of December we had
reached the thirtieth mile from the place where we started, and the
scouts brought word to the general that we were ahead of the flying
enemy.We then turned off the road to our right in the direction of the
Ganges, and by eight o'clock came in sight of the enemy at Serai _ghat_,
a ferry twenty-five miles above Cawnpore, preparing to embark the guns
of which we were in pursuit.Our cavalry and horse-artillery at once galloped to the front through
ploughed fields, and opened fire on the boats.The enemy returned the
fire, and some Mahratta cavalry made a dash at the guns, but their
charge was met by the Ninth Lancers and the detachment of Hodson's
Horse, and a number of them cut down.Seeing the infantry advancing in
line, the enemy broke and fled for the boats, leaving all their fifteen
guns, a large number of ordnance waggons loaded with ammunition, and a
hundred carts filled with their baggage and the plunder of Cawnpore.Our
horse-artillery and infantry advanced right up to the banks of the river
and kept up a hot fire on the retreating boats, swamping a great number
of them.The Nana Sahib was among this lot; but the spies reported that
his boat was the first to put off, and he gained the Oude side in
safety, though some thousands of his Mahratta rebels must have been
drowned or killed.This was some return we felt for his treachery at
Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ six months before.It was now our turn to be
peppering the flying boats!There were a number of women and children
left by the routed rebels among their baggage-carts; they evidently
expected to be killed, but were escorted to a village in our rear, and
left there.We showed them that we had come to war with men--not to
butcher women!By the afternoon we had dragged the whole of the captured
guns back from the river, and our tents coming up under the rear-guard,
we encamped for the night, glad enough to get a rest.On the morning of the 10th our quarter-master divided among us a lot of
shirts and underclothing, mostly what the enemy had captured at
Cawnpore, a great part of which we had now recovered; and we were
allowed to go by wings to undress and have a bath in the sacred Ganges,
and to change our underclothing, which we very much needed to do.The
condition of our flannel shirts is best left undescribed, while our
bodies round our waists, where held tight by our belts, were eaten to
raw flesh.We sent our shirts afloat on the sacred waters of Mother
Gunga, glad to be rid of them, and that night we slept in comfort.Even
now, thirty-five years after, the recollection of the state of my own
flannel when I took it off makes me shiver.This is not a pleasant
subject, but I am writing these reminiscences for the information of our
soldiers of to-day, and merely stating facts, to let them understand
something of what the soldiers of the Mutiny had to go through.Up to this time, the columns of the British had been mostly acting, as
it were, on the defensive; but from the date of the defeat of the
Gwalior Contingent, our star was in the ascendant, and the attitude of
the country people showed that they understood which was the winning
side.Provisions, such as butter, milk, eggs, and fruit, were brought
into our camp by the villagers for sale the next morning, sparingly at
first, but as soon as the people found that they were well received and
honestly paid for their supplies, they came in by scores, and from that
time there was no scarcity of provisions in our bazaars.We halted at Serai _ghat_ for the 11th and 12th December, and on the
13th marched back in triumph to Bithoor with our captured guns.The
reason of our return to Bithoor was because spies had reported that the
Nana Sahib had concealed a large amount of treasure in a well there near
the palace of the ex-Peishwa of Poona.Rupees to the amount of thirty
_lakhs_[31] were recovered, which had been packed in ammunition-boxes
and sunk in a well; also a very large amount of gold and silver plate
and other valuables, among other articles a silver howdah which had been
the state howdah of the ex-Peishwa.Besides the rupees, the plate and
other valuables recovered were said to be worth more than a million
sterling, and it was circulated in the force that each private soldier
would receive over a thousand rupees in prize-money.But we never got a
_pie_![32] All we did get was hard work.Four strong
frames were erected on the top of it by the sappers, and large leathern
buckets with strong iron frames, with ropes attached, were brought from
Cawnpore; then a squad of twenty-five men was put on to each rope, and
relieved every three hours, two buckets keeping the water down and two
drawing up treasure.Thus we worked day and night from the 15th to the
26th of December, the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and Ninety-Third
supplying the working-parties for pulling, and the Bengal Sappers
furnishing the men to work in the well; these last, having to stand in
the water all the time, were relieved every hour.It was no light work
to keep the water down, so as to allow the sappers to sling the boxes
containing the rupees, and to lift three million rupees, or thirty
_lakhs_, out from a deep well required considerable labour.But the
men, believing that the whole would be divided as prize-money, worked
with a will.A paternal Government, however, ignored our general's
assurance on this head, on the plea that we had merely recovered the
treasure carried off by the Nana from Cawnpore.The plate and jewellery
belonging to the ex-Peishwa were also claimed by the Government as State
property, and the troops got--nothing!We had even to pay from our own
pockets for the replacement of our kits which were taken by the Gwalior
Contingent when they captured Wyndham's camp.About this time _The Illustrated London News_ reached India with a
picture purporting to be that of the Nana Sahib.I forget the date of
the number which contained this picture; but I first saw it in Bithoor
some time between the 15th and 25th December 1857.I will now give the
history of that picture, and show how Ajoodia Pershad, commonly known as
Jotee Pershad, the commissariat contractor, came to figure as the Nana
Sahib in the pages of _The Illustrated London News_.It is a well-known
fact that there is no authentic portrait of the Nana in existence; it is
even asserted that he was never painted by any artist, and photography
had not extended to Upper India before 1857.I believe this is the first
time that the history of the picture published as that of the Nana Sahib
by _The Illustrated London News_ has been given.I learnt the facts
which I am about to relate some years after the Mutiny, under a promise
of secrecy so long as my informant, the late John Lang,
barrister-at-law and editor and proprietor of _The Mofussilite_, should
be alive.As both he and Ajoodia Pershad have been many years dead, I
commit no breach of confidence in now telling the story.The picture
purporting to be that of the Nana having been published in 1857, it
rightly forms a reminiscence of the Mutiny, although much of the
following tale occurred several years earlier; but to make the history
of the picture complete, the facts which led to it must be noticed.There are but few Europeans now in India who remember the scandal
connected with the trial of Ajoodia Pershad, the commissariat
contractor, for payment for the supplies and carriage of the army
throughout the second Sikh war.When it came to a final settlement of
his accounts with the Commissariat Department, Ajoodia Pershad claimed
three and a half _crores_ of rupees (equal to three and a half millions
sterling), in excess of what the auditor would pass as justly due to
him; and the Commissariat Department, backed by the Government of India,
not only repudiated the claim, but put Ajoodia Pershad on his trial for
falsification of accounts and attempting to defraud the Government.There being no high courts in those days, nor trial by jury, corrupt or
otherwise, for natives in the Upper Provinces, an order of the
Governor-General in Council was passed for the trial of Ajoodia Pershad
by special commission, with the judge-advocate-general as prosecutor.The trial was ordered to be held at Meerut, and the commission
assembled there, commencing its sittings in the Artillery mess-house
during the cold weather of 1851-52.There were no barristers or pleaders
in India in those days--at least in the Mofussil, and but few in the
presidency towns; but Ajoodia Pershad, being a very wealthy man, sent an
agent to England, and engaged the services of Mr.John Lang,
barrister-at-law, to come out and defend him.John Lang left England in
May, 1851, and came out round the Cape in one of Green's celebrated
liners, the _Nile_, and he reached Meerut about December, when the trial
commenced.Everything went swimmingly with the prosecution till Mr.Lang began his
cross-examination of the witnesses, he having reserved his privilege
till he heard the whole case for the prosecution.Directly the
cross-examination commenced, the weakness of the Government case became
apparent.I need not now recall how the commissary-general, the deputy
commissary-general, and their assistants were made to contradict each
other, and to contradict themselves out of their own mouths.Lang,
who appeared in court every day in his wig and gown, soon became a noted
character in Meerut, and the night before he was to sum up the case for
the defence, some officers in the Artillery mess asked him his opinion
of the members of the commission.Not being a teetotaller, Mr.Lang may
have been at the time somewhat under the influence of "John Exshaw," who
was the ruling spirit in those days, and he replied that the whole
batch, president and members, including the judge-advocate-general, were
a parcel of "d--d _soors_."[33] Immediately several officers present
offered to lay a bet of a thousand rupees with Mr.Lang that he was not
game to tell them so to their faces in open court the following day.Lang accepted the bet, the stakes were deposited, and an umpire
appointed to decide who should pocket the money.When the court
re-assembled next morning, the excitement was intense.Lang opened
his address by pulling the evidence for the prosecution to shreds, and
warming to his work, he went at it somewhat as follows--I can only give
the purport:--"Gentlemen of the commission forming this court, I now
place the dead carcass of this shameful case before you in all its naked
deformity, and the more we stir it up the more it stinks!The only stink
in my long experience that I can compare it to is the experience gained
in the saloon of the _Nile_ on my passage out to India the day after a
pig was slaughtered.We had a pig's cheek at the head of the table
[indicating the president of the commission]; we had a roast leg of pork
on the right [pointing to another member]; we had a boiled leg, also
pork, on the left [indicating a third member]"; and so on he went till
he had apportioned out the whole carcass of the supposed pig amongst the
members of the commission.Then, turning to the judge-advocate-general,
who was a little man dressed in an elaborately frilled shirt, and his
assistant, who was tall and thin, pointing to each in turn, Mr.Lang
proceeded,--"And for side-dishes we had chitterlings on one side, and
sausages on the other.In brief, the whole saloon smelt of nothing but
pork: and so it is, gentlemen, with this case.It is the Government of
India who has ordered this trial.It is for the interest of that
Government that my client should be convicted; therefore every member on
this commission is a servant of Government.The officers representing
the prosecution are servants of Government, and every witness for the
prosecution is also a servant of Government.In brief, the whole case
against my client is nothing but pork, and a disgrace to the Government
of India, and to the Honourable East India Company, who have sanctioned
this trial, and who put every obstacle in my way to prevent my coming
out to defend my client.I repeat my assertion that the case is a
disgrace to the Honourable Company and the Government of India, and to
every servant of that Government who has had any finger in the
manufacture of this pork-pie."Lang continued, showing how
Ajoodia Pershad had come forward to the assistance of the State in its
hour of need, by supplying carriage for the materials of the army and
rations for the troops, and so forth, till the judge-advocate-general
declared that he felt ashamed to be connected with the case.The result
was that Ajoodia Pershad was acquitted on all counts, and decreed to be
entitled to his claims in full, and the umpire decided that Mr.Lang had
won the bet of a thousand rupees.But my readers may ask--What has all this to do with the portrait of the
Nana Sahib?After his honourable acquittal,
Ajoodia Pershad was so grateful to Mr.Lang that he presented him with
an honorarium of three _lakhs_ of rupees, equal in those days to over
L30,000, in addition to the fees on his brief; and Mr.Lang happening to
say that he would very much like to have a portrait of his generous
client, Ajoodia Pershad presented him with one painted by a famous
native artist of those days, and the portrait was enshrined in a
jewelled frame worth another twenty-five thousand rupees.Lang used to carry this portrait with him wherever he
went.When the Mutiny broke out he was in London, and the artists of
_The Illustrated London News_ were calling on every old Indian of
position known to be in England, to try and get a portrait of the Nana.Lang possessed a picture of an Indian
prince--then, as now, all Indians were princes to the British
public--which might be that of the arch-assassin of Cawnpore.The artist
lost no time in calling on Mr.Lang to see the picture, and when he saw
it he declared it was just the thing he wanted.Lang protested,
pointing out that the picture no more resembled the Nana of Bithoor than
it did her Gracious Majesty the Queen of England; that neither the dress
nor the position of the person represented in the picture could pass in
India for a Mahratta chief.The artist declared he did not care for
people in India: he required the picture for the people of England.So
he carried it off to the engraver, and in the next issue of _The
Illustrated London News_ the picture of Ajoodia Pershad, the
commissariat contractor, appeared as that of the Nana Sahib.When those
in India who had known the Nana saw it, they declared it had no
resemblance to him whatever, and those who had seen Ajoodia Pershad
declared that the Nana was very like Ajoodia Pershad.But no one could
understand how the Nana could ever have allowed himself to be painted in
the dress of a Marwaree banker.To the day of his death John Lang was in
mortal fear lest Ajoodia Pershad should ever come to hear how his
picture had been allowed to figure as that of the arch-assassin of the
Indian Mutiny.By Christmas Day, 1857, we had recovered
all the gold and silver plate of the ex-Peishwa and the thirty _lakhs_
of treasure from the well in Bithoor, and on the morning of the 27th we
marched for the recapture of Futtehghur, which was held by a strong
force under the Nawab of Furruckabad.But I must leave the re-occupation
of Futtehghur for another chapter.NOTE

      Jotee Pershad was the native banker who, during the height
      of the Mutiny, victualled the Fort of Agra and saved the
      credit, if not the lives, of the members of the Government
      of the North-West Provinces.FOOTNOTES:

HODSON OF HODSON'S HORSE--ACTION AT THE KALEE NUDDEE--FUTTEHGHUR


As a further proof that the British star was now in the ascendant,
before we had been many days in Bithoor each company had got its full
complement of native establishment, such as cooks, water-carriers,
washer-men, etc.We left Bithoor on the 27th of December _en route_ for
Futtehghur, and on the 28th we made a forced march of twenty-five miles,
joining the Commander-in-Chief on the 29th.Early on the 30th we reached
a place named Meerun-ke-serai, and our tents had barely been pitched
when word went through the camp like wildfire that Hodson, of Hodson's
Horse, and another officer[34] had arrived in camp with despatches from
Brigadier Seaton to the Commander-in-Chief, having ridden from
Mynpooree, about seventy miles from where we were.We of the Ninety-Third were eager to see Hodson, having heard so much
about him from the men of the Ninth Lancers.There was nothing, however
daring or difficult, that Hodson was not believed capable of doing, and
a ride of seventy miles more or less through a country swarming with
enemies, where every European who ventured beyond the range of British
guns literally carried his life in his hand, was not considered anything
extraordinary for him.Personally, I was most anxious to see this famous
fellow, but as yet there was no chance; Hodson was in the tent of the
Commander-in-Chief, and no one knew when he might come out.However, the
hours passed, and during the afternoon a man of my company rushed into
the tent, calling, "Come, boys, and see Hodson!He and Sir Colin are in
front of the camp; Sir Colin is showing him round, and the smile on the
old Chief's face shows how he appreciates his companion."I hastened to
the front of the camp, and was rewarded by having a good look at Hodson;
and, as the man who had called us had said, I could see that he had made
a favourable impression on Sir Colin.Little did I then think that in
less than three short months I should see Hodson receive his
death-wound, and that thirty-five years after I should be one of the few
spared to give evidence to save his fair fame from undeserved slander.My memory always turns back to that afternoon at Meerunke-serai when I
read any attack on the good name of Hodson of Hodson's Horse.And
whatever prejudiced writers of the present day may say, the name of
Hodson will be a name to conjure with among the Sikhs of the Punjab for
generations yet unborn.On the 1st of January, 1858, our force reached the Kalee Nuddee
suspension bridge near Khoodagunj, about fifteen miles from Futtehghur,
just in time to prevent the total destruction of the bridge by the
enemy, who had removed a good part of the planking from the roadway, and
had commenced to cut the iron-work when we arrived.We halted on the
Cawnpore side of the Kalee Nuddee on New Year's Day, while the
engineers, under cover of strong piquets, were busy replacing the
planking of the roadway on the suspension bridge.Early on the morning
of the 2nd of January the enemy from Futtehghur, under cover of a thick
fog along the valley of the Kalee Nuddee, came down in great force to
dispute the passage of the river.The first intimation of their approach
was a shell fired on our advance piquet; but our camp was close to the
bridge, and the whole force was under arms in an instant.As soon as the
fog lifted the enemy were seen to have occupied the village of
Khoodagunj in great force, and to have advanced one gun, a 24-pounder,
planting it in the toll-house which commanded the passage of the bridge,
so as to fire it out of the front window just as if from the porthole of
a ship.As soon as the position of the enemy was seen, the cavalry brigade of
our force was detached to the left, under cover of the dense jungle
along the river, to cross by a ford which was discovered about five
miles up stream to our left, the intention of the movement being to get
in behind the enemy and cut off his retreat to Futtehghur.The Fifty-Third were pushed across the bridge to reinforce the piquets,
with orders not to advance, but to act on the defensive, so as to allow
time for the cavalry to get behind the enemy.The right wing of the
Ninety-Third was also detached with some horse-artillery guns to the
right, to cross by another ford about three miles below the bridge, to
attack the enemy on his left flank.The left wing was held in reserve
with the remainder of the force behind the bridge, to be in readiness to
reinforce the Fifty-Third in case of need.By the time these dispositions were made, the enemy's gun from the
toll-house had begun to do considerable damage.Peel's heavy guns were
accordingly brought to bear on it, and, after a round or two to feel
their distance, they were able to pitch an 8-inch shell right through
the window, which burst under the gun, upsetting it, and killing or
disabling most of the enemy in the house.Immediately after this the Fifty-Third, being well in advance, noticed
the enemy attempting to withdraw some of his heavy guns from the
village, and disregarding the order of the Commander-in-Chief not to
precipitate the attack, they charged these guns and captured two or
three of them.This check caused the enemy's line to retire, and Sir
Colin himself rode up to the Fifty-Third to bring to book the officer
commanding them for prematurely commencing the action.This officer
threw the blame on the men, stating that they had made the charge
against his orders, and that the officers had been unable to keep them
back.Sir Colin then turned on the men, threatening to send them to the
rear, and to make them do fatigue-duty and baggage-guard for the rest of
the campaign.On this an old Irishman from the ranks called out: "Shure,
Sir Colin, you don't mean it!You'll never send us on fatigue-duty
because we captured those guns that the Pandies were carrying off?";
Hearing this, Sir Colin asked what guns he meant."Shure, them's the
guns," was the answer, "that Sergeant Dobbin [now Joe Lee of Cawnpore]
and his section are dragging on to the road."Sir Colin seeing the guns,
his stern countenance relaxed and broke into a smile, and he made some
remark to the officer commanding that he did not know about the guns
having been withdrawn before the regiment had made the rush on the
enemy.On this the Irish spokesman from the ranks called out: "Three
cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys!I told you he did not mean us
to let the Pandies carry off those guns."By this time our right wing and the horse-artillery had crossed the ford
on our right and were well advanced on the enemy's left flank.But we of
the main line, composed of the Eighth (the old "King's"--now called the
Liverpool Regiment, I think), the Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, and left
wing of the Ninety-Third under Adrian Hope, were allowed to advance
slowly, just keeping them in sight.The enemy retired in an orderly
manner for about three or four miles, when they formed up to make a
stand, evidently thinking we were afraid to press them too closely.As
soon as they faced round again, our line was halted only about seven
hundred yards from them, and just then we could see our cavalry
debouching on to the Grand Trunk road about a mile from where we were.My company was in the centre of the road, and I could see the tips of
the lances of the Ninth wheeling into line for a charge right in the
enemy's rear.He was completely out-generalled, and his retreat cut off.The excitement was just then intense, as we dared not fire for fear of
hitting our men in the rear.The Forty-First Native Infantry was the
principal regiment of the enemy's line on the Grand Trunk road.Directly
they saw the Lancers in their rear they formed square while the enemy's
cavalry charged our men, but were met in fine style by Hodson's Horse
and sent flying across the fields in all directions.The Ninth came down
on the square of the Native Infantry, who stood their ground and opened
fire.The Lancers charged well up to within about thirty yards, when the
horses turned off right and left from the solid square.We were just
preparing to charge it with the bayonet, when at that moment the
squadrons were brought round again, just as a hawk takes a circle for a
swoop on its prey, and we saw Sergeant-Major May, who was mounted on a
powerful untrained horse, dash on the square and leap right into it,
followed by the squadron on that side.The square being thus broken, the
other troops of the Ninth rode into the flying mass, and in less than
five minutes the Forty-First regiment of Native Infantry was wiped out
of the ranks of the mutineers.The enemy's line of retreat became a
total rout, and the plain for miles was strewn with corpses speared down
by the Lancers or hewn down by the keen-edged sabres of Hodson's Horse.Our infantry line now advanced, but there was nothing for us to do but
collect the ammunition-carts and baggage of the enemy.Just about sunset
we halted and saw the Lancers and Sikhs returning with the captured
standards and every gun which the enemy had brought into the field in
the morning.The infantry formed up along the side of the Grand Trunk
road to cheer the cavalry as they returned.It was a sight never to be
forgotten,--the infantry and sailors cheering the Lancers and Sikhs, and
the latter returning our cheers and waving the captured standards and
their lances and sabres over their heads!Sir Colin Campbell rode up,
and lifting his hat, thanked the Ninth Lancers and Sikhs for their day's
work.It was reported in the camp that Sir Hope Grant had recommended
Sergeant-Major May for the Victoria Cross, but that May had modestly
remonstrated against the honour, saying that every man in the Ninth was
as much entitled to the Cross as he was, and that he was only able to
break the square by the accident of being mounted on an untrained horse
which charged into the square instead of turning off from it.This is of
course hearsay, but I believe it is fact.I may here remark that this charge of the Lancers forcibly impressed me
with the absurdity of our cavalry-drill for the purpose of breaking an
infantry square.On field-days in time of peace our cavalry were made
to charge squares of infantry, and directly the horses came within
thirty or forty yards the squadrons opened out right and left, galloping
clear of the square under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses
were thus drilled to turn off and gallop clear of the squares, instead
of charging home right through the infantry.When it came to actual war
the horses, not being reasoning animals, naturally acted just as on a
field-day; instead of charging straight into the square, they galloped
right past it, simply because they were drilled to do so.Of course, I
do not propose that several battalions of infantry should be slaughtered
every field-day for the purpose of training cavalry.But I would have
the formation altered, and instead of having the infantry in solid
squares, I would form them into quarter distance columns, with lanes
between the companies wide enough for the cavalry to gallop through
under the blank fire of the infantry.The horses would thus be trained
to gallop straight on, and no square of infantry would be able to resist
a charge of well-trained cavalry when it came to actual war.I am
convinced, in my own mind, that this was the reason that the untrained
remount ridden by Sergeant-Major May charged into the square of the
Forty-First, and broke it, while the well-drilled horses galloped round
the flanks in spite of their riders.But the square once being broken,
the other horses followed as a matter of course.However, we are now in
the age of breech-loaders and magazine rifles, and I fear the days of
cavalry charging squares of infantry are over.But we are still a long
way from the millennium, and the experience of the past may yet be
turned to account for the wars of the future.We reached Futtehghur on the morning of the 3rd of January to find it
deserted, the enemy having got such a "drubbing" that it had struck
terror into their reserves, which had bolted across the Ganges, leaving
large quantities of Government property behind them, consisting of tents
and all the ordnance stores of the Gun-carriage Agency.The enemy had
also established a gun and shot and shell foundry here, and a
powder-factory, all of which they had abandoned, leaving a number of
brass guns in the lathes, half turned, with many more just cast, and
large quantities of metal and material for the manufacture of both
powder and shot.During the afternoon of the day of our arrival the whole force was
turned out, owing to a report that the Nawab of Furruckabad was still in
the town; and it was said that the civil officer with the force had sent
a proclamation through the city that it would be given over to plunder
if the Nawab was not surrendered.Whether this was true or not, I cannot
say.The district was no longer under martial law, as from the date of
the defeat of the Gwalior Contingent the civil power had resumed
authority on the right bank of the Ganges.But so far as the country was
concerned, around Futtehghur at least, this merely meant that the
hangmen's noose was to be substituted for rifle-bullet and bayonet.However, our force had scarcely been turned out to threaten the town of
Furruckabad when the Nawab was brought out, bound hand and foot, and
carried by _coolies_ on a common country _charpoy_.[35] I don't know
what process of trial he underwent; but I fear he had neither jury nor
counsel, and I know that he was first smeared over with pig's fat,
flogged by sweepers, and then hanged.This was by the orders of the
civil commissioner.Both Sir Colin Campbell and Sir William Peel were
said to have protested against the barbarity, but this I don't know for
certain.We halted in Futtehghur till the 6th, on which date a brigade, composed
of the Forty-Second, Ninety-Third, a regiment of Punjab infantry, a
battery of artillery, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers, and Hodson's
Horse, marched to Palamhow in the Shumshabad district.This town had
been a hot-bed of rebellion under the leadership of a former native
collector of revenue, who had proclaimed himself Raja of the district,
and all the bad characters in it had flocked to his standard.However,
the place was occupied without opposition.We encamped outside the town,
and the civil police, along with the commissioner, arrested great
numbers, among them being the man who had proclaimed himself the Raja or
Nawab for the Emperor of Delhi.My company, with some of Hodson's Horse
and two artillery guns, formed a guard for the civil commissioner in the
_chowk_ or principal square of the town.The commissioner held his court
in what had formerly been the _kotwaiee_ or police station.I cannot say
what form of trial the prisoners underwent, or what evidence was
recorded against them.I merely know that they were marched up in
batches, and shortly after marched back again to a large tree of the
banian species, which stood in the centre of the square, and hanged
thereon.This went on from about three o'clock in the afternoon till
daylight the following morning, when it was reported that there was no
more room on the tree, and by that time there were one hundred and
thirty men hanging from its branches.Many charges of cruelty and want of pity have been made against the
character of Hodson.This makes me here mention a fact that certainly
does not tend to prove these charges.During the afternoon of the day of
which I write, Hodson visited the squadron of his regiment forming the
cavalry of the civil commissioner's guard.Just at the time of his visit
the commissioner wanted a hangman, and asked if any man of the
Ninety-Third would volunteer for the job, stating as an inducement that
all valuables in the way of rings or money found on the persons of the
condemned would become the property of the executioner.No one
volunteering for the job, the commissioner asked Jack Brian, a big tall
fellow who was the right-hand man of the company, if he would act as
executioner.Jack Brian turned round with a look of disgust, saying:
"Wha do ye tak' us for?We of the Ninety-Third enlisted to fight men
with arms in their hands.I widna' become yer hangman for all the loot
in India!"Captain Hodson was standing close by, and hearing the answer,
said, "Well answered, my brave fellow.I wish to shake hands with you,"
which he did.Then turning to Captain Dawson, Hodson said: "I'm sick of
work of this kind.I'm glad I'm not on duty;" and he mounted his horse,
and rode off.However, some _domes_[36] or sweeper-police were found to
act as hangmen, and the trials and executions proceeded.We returned to Futtehghur on the 12th of January and remained in camp
there till the 26th, when another expedition was sent out in the same
direction.But this time only the right wing of the Ninety-Third and a
wing of the Forty-Second formed the infantry, so my company remained in
camp.This second force met with more opposition than the first one.Lieutenant Macdowell, Hodson's second in command, and several troopers
were killed, and Hodson himself and some of his men were badly wounded,
Hodson having two severe cuts on his sword arm; while the infantry had
several men killed who were blown up with gunpowder.This force returned
on the 28th of January, and either on the 2nd or 3rd of February we left
Futtehghur _en route_ again for Lucknow _via_ Cawnpore.We reached Cawnpore by ordinary marches, crossed into Oude, and encamped
at Oonao till the whole of the siege-train was passed on to Lucknow.FOOTNOTES:

THE STRANGE STORY OF JAMIE GREEN


When we returned to Cawnpore, although we had been barely two months
away, we found it much altered.Many of the burnt-down bungalows were
being rebuilt, and the fort at the end of the bridge of boats had become
quite a strong place.The well where the murdered women and children
were buried was now completely filled up, and a wooden cross erected
over it.I visited the slaughter-house again, and found the walls of the
several rooms all scribbled over both in pencil and charcoal.This had
been done since my first visit in October; I am positive on this point.The unfortunate women who were murdered in the house left no writing on
the walls whatever.There was writing on the walls of the barrack-rooms
of Wheeler's entrenchment, mostly notes that had been made during the
siege, but none on the walls of the slaughter-house.As mentioned in my
last chapter, we only halted one day in Cawnpore before crossing into
Oude, and marching to Oonao about the 10th of February, we encamped
there as a guard for the siege-train and ordnance-park which was being
pushed on to Lucknow.While at Oonao a strange thing happened, which I shall here set down.Men live such busy lives in India that many who may have heard the story
at the time have possibly forgotten all about it, while to most of my
home-staying readers it will be quite fresh.Towards the end of February, 1858, the army for the siege of Lucknow was
gradually being massed in front of the doomed city, and lay, like a huge
boa-constrictor coiled and ready for its spring, all along the road from
Cawnpore to the Alumbagh.A strong division, consisting of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third Highlanders, the Fifty-Third, the Ninth
Lancers, Peel's Naval Brigade, the siege-train, and several batteries of
field-artillery, with the Fourth Punjab Infantry and other Punjabee
corps, lay at Oonao under the command of General Sir Edward Lugard and
Brigadier Adrian Hope.We had been encamped in that place for about ten
days,--the monotony of our lives being only occasionally broken by the
sound of distant cannonading in front--when we heard that General
Outram's position at the Alumbagh had been vigorously attacked by a
force from Lucknow, sometimes led by the Moulvie, and at others by the
Begum in person.Now and then somewhat duller sounds came from the rear,
which, we understood, arose from the operations of Sir Robert Napier and
his engineers, who were engaged in blowing up the temples of Siva and
Kalee overlooking the _ghats_ at Cawnpore; not, as some have asserted,
out of revenge, but for military considerations connected with the
safety of the bridge of boats across the Ganges.During one of these days of comparative inaction, I was lying in my tent
reading some home papers which had just arrived by the mail, when I
heard a man passing through the camp, calling out, "Plum-cakes!The
advent of a plum-cake _wallah_ was an agreeable change from ration-beef
and biscuit, and he was soon called into the tent, and his own maxim of
"taste and try before you buy" freely put into practice.This plum-cake
vendor was a very good-looking, light- native in the prime of
life, dressed in scrupulously clean white clothes, with dark, curly
whiskers and mustachios, carefully trimmed after the fashion of the
Mahommedan native officers of John Company's army.He had a
well-developed forehead, a slightly aquiline nose, and intelligent eyes.Altogether his appearance was something quite different from that of the
usual camp-follower.But his companion, or rather the man employed as
_coolie_ to carry his basket, was one of the most villainous-looking
specimens of humanity I ever set eyes on.As was the custom in those
days, seeing that he did not belong to our own bazaar, and being the
non-commissioned officer in charge of the tent, I asked the plum-cake
man if he was provided with a pass for visiting the camp?"Oh yes,
Sergeant _sahib_," he replied, "there's my pass all in order, not from
the Brigade-Major, but from the Brigadier himself, the Honourable Adrian
Hope.I'm Jamie Green, mess-_khansama_[37] of the late (I forget the
regiment he mentioned), and I have just come to Oonao with a letter of
introduction to General Hope from Sherer _sahib_, the magistrate and
collector of Cawnpore.You will doubtless know General Hope's
handwriting."And there it was, all in order, authorising the bearer, by
name Jamie Green, etc.etc., to visit both the camp and outpost for the
sale of his plum-cakes, in the handwriting of the brigadier, which was
well known to all the non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third,
Hope having been colonel of the regiment.Next to his appearance what struck me as the most remarkable thing about
Jamie Green was the purity and easy flow of his English, for he at once
sat down beside me, and asked to see the newspapers, and seemed anxious
to know what the English press said about the mutiny, and to talk of all
subjects connected with the strength, etc., of the army, the
preparations going forward for the siege of Lucknow, and how the
newly-arrived regiments were likely to stand the hot weather.In course
of conversation I made some remarks about the fluency of his English,
and he accounted for it by stating that his father had been the
mess-_khansama_ of a European regiment, and that he had been brought up
to speak English from his childhood, that he had learned to read and
write in the regimental school, and for many years had filled the post
of mess-writer, keeping all the accounts of the mess in English.During
this time the men in the tent had been freely trying the plum-cakes, and
a squabble arose between one of them and Jamie Green's servant about
payment.When I made some remark about the villainous look of the
latter Green replied: "Oh, never mind him; he is an Irishman, and his
name is Micky.His mother belongs to the regimental bazaar of the
Eighty-Seventh Royal Irish, and he lays claim to the whole regiment,
including the sergeant-major's cook, for his father.He has just come
down from the Punjab with the Agra convoy, but the commanding officer
dismissed him at Cawnpore, because he had a young wife of his own, and
was jealous of the good looks of Micky.But," continued Jamie Green, "a
joke is a joke, but to eat a man's plum-cakes and then refuse to pay for
them must be a Highland joke!"On this every man in the tent,
appreciating the good humour of Jamie Green, turned on the man who had
refused payment, and he was obliged to fork out the amount demanded.Jamie Green and Micky passed on to another tent, after the former had
borrowed a few of the latest of my newspapers.Thus ended my first
interview with the plum-cake vendor.The second one was more interesting, and with a sadder termination.On
the evening of the day after the events just described, I was on duty as
sergeant in charge of our camp rear-guard, and at sunset when the
orderly-corporal came round with the evening grog, he told us the
strange news that Jamie Green, the plum-cake _wallah_, had been
discovered to be a spy from Lucknow, had been arrested, and was then
undergoing examination at the brigade-major's tent; and that it being
too late to hang him that night, he was to be made over to my guard for
safe custody, and that men had been warned for extra sentry on the
guard-tent.I need not say that I was very sorry to hear the
information, for, although a spy is at all times detested in the army,
and no mercy is ever shown to one, yet I had formed a strong regard for
this man, and a high opinion of his abilities in the short conversation
I had held with him the previous day; and during the interval I had been
thinking over how a man of his appearance and undoubted education could
hold so low a position as that of a common camp-follower.But now the
news that he had been discovered to be a spy accounted for the anomaly.It would be needless for me to describe the bitter feeling of all
classes against the mutineers, or rebels, and for any one to be
denounced as a spy simply added fuel to the flames of hatred.Asiatic
campaigns have always been conducted in a more remorseless spirit than
those between European nations, but the war of the Mutiny, as I have
before remarked in these reminiscences, was far worse than the usual
type of even Asiatic fighting.It was something horrible and downright
brutalising for an English army to be engaged in such a struggle, in
which no quarter was ever given or asked.It was a war of downright
butchery.Wherever the rebels met a Christian or a white man he was
killed without pity or remorse, and every native who had assisted any
such to escape, or was known to have concealed them, was as
remorselessly put to death wherever the rebels had the ascendant.And
wherever a European in power, either civil or military, met a rebel in
arms, or any native whatever on whom suspicion rested, his shrift was as
short and his fate as sure.The farce of putting an accused native on
his trial before any of the civil officers attached to the different
army-columns, after the civil power commenced to reassert its authority,
was simply a parody on justice and a protraction of cruelty.Under
martial law, punishment, whether deserved or not, was stern but sharp.But the civilian officers attached to the different movable columns for
the trial of rebels, as far as they came under my notice, were even more
relentless.No doubt these men excused themselves by the consideration
that they were engaged in suppressing rebellion and mutiny, and that the
actors on the other side had perpetrated great crimes.[38] So far as the
Commander-in-Chief was concerned, Sir Colin Campbell was utterly opposed
to extreme measures, and deeply deplored the wholesale executions by the
civil power.Although as a soldier he would have been the last man in
the country to spare rebels caught with arms in their hands, or those
whose guilt was well known (and I know for certain that he held the
action of Major Hodson with regard to the Delhi princes to have been
justifiable), I well remember how emphatically I once heard him express
his disgust when, on the march back from Futtehghur to Cawnpore, he
entered a mango-tope full of rotting corpses, where one of those special
commissioners had passed through with a movable column a few days
before.I had barely heard the news that Green
had been arrested as a spy, when he was brought to my guard by some of
the provost-marshal's staff, and handed over to me with instructions to
keep him safe till he should be called for next morning.He was
accompanied by the man who had carried his basket, who had also been
denounced as one of the butchers at Cawnpore in July, 1857.And here I
may state that the appearance of this man certainly did tally with the
description afterwards given of one of these butchers by Fitchett, an
Eurasian drummer attached to the Sixth Native Infantry which mutinied at
Cawnpore, who embraced the Mahommedan religion to save his life, and was
enrolled in the rebel force, but afterwards made his escape and
presented himself at Meerut for enlistment in the police levy raised in
October, 1858.What I am relating took place in February, 1858, about
eight months before the existence of Fitchett was known to the
authorities.However, when it was discovered that Fitchett had been
serving in one of the mutineers' regiments, he was called on to say what
he knew about the Cawnpore massacre, and I remember his statement was
considered the most consistent of any of the numerous narratives
published about it.Fitchett alleged that the sepoys of the Sixth
Native Infantry and other regiments, including the Nana Sahib's own
guard, had refused to kill the European women and children in the
_bibi-ghur_,[39] and that five men were then brought by a slave-girl or
mistress of the Nana to do it.Of the five men employed, two were
butchers and two were villagers, and the fifth man was "a stout
_bilaitee_[40] with very hairy hands."Fitchett further described one of
the butchers as a tall, ugly man, very dark, and very much disfigured by
smallpox, all points that tallied exactly with the appearance of this
_coolie_.I don't suppose that Fitchett could have known that a man
answering to his description had been hanged, as being one of the actors
in the Cawnpore tragedy, some eight months before, for I don't recollect
ever having seen the matter which I am relating mentioned in any
newspaper.My prisoners had no sooner been made
over to me, than several of the guard, as was usual in those days,
proposed to bring some pork from the bazaar to break their castes, as a
sort of preparation for their execution.This I at once denounced as a
proceeding which I certainly would not tolerate so long as I held charge
of the guard, and I warned the men that if any one attempted to molest
the prisoners, I should at once strip them of their belts, and place
them in arrest for disobedience of orders and conduct unworthy of a
British soldier, and the better-disposed portion of the guard at once
applauded my resolution.I shall never forget the look of gratitude
which came over the face of the unfortunate man who had called himself
Jamie Green, when he heard me give these orders.He at once said it was
an act of kindness which he had never expected, and for which he was
truly grateful; and he unhesitatingly pronounced his belief that Allah
and his Prophet would requite my kindness by bringing me safely through
the remainder of the war.I thanked my prisoner for his good wishes and
his prayers, and made him the only return in my power, viz., to cause
his hands to be unfastened to allow him to perform his evening's
devotions, and permitted him as much freedom as I possibly could,
consistent with safe custody.His fellow-prisoner merely received my
kindness with a scowl of sullen hatred, and when reproved by his master,
I understood him to say that he wished for no favour from infidel dogs;
but he admitted that the sergeant _sahib_, deserved a Mussulman's
gratitude for saving him from an application of pig's fat.After allowing my prisoners to perform their evening devotions, and
giving them such freedom as I could, I made up my mind to go without
sleep that night, for it would have been a serious matter for me if
either of these men had escaped.I also knew that by remaining on watch
myself I could allow them more freedom, and I determined they should
enjoy every privilege in my power for what would certainly be their last
night on earth, since it was doubtful if they would be spared to see
the sun rise.With this view, I sent for one of the Mahommedan
shopkeepers from the regimental bazaar, and told him to prepare at my
expense whatever food the prisoners would eat.To this the man replied
that since I, a Christian, had shown so much kindness to a Mussulman in
distress, the Mahommedan shopkeepers in the bazaar would certainly be
untrue to their faith if they should allow me to spend a single _pie_,
from my own pocket.After being supplied with a savoury meal from the bazaar, followed by a
fragrant hookah, to both of which he did ample justice, Jamie Green
settled himself on a rug which had been lent to him, and said "_Shook'r
Khooda!_, (Thanks be to God)," for having placed him under the charge of
such a merciful _sahib_, for this the last night of his life!"Such," he
continued, "has been my _kismut_, and doubtless Allah will reward you,
Sergeant _sahib_, in his own good time for your kindness to his
oppressed and afflicted servant.You have asked me to give you some
account of my life, and if it is really true that I am a spy.With
regard to being a spy in the ordinary meaning of the term, I most
emphatically deny the accusation.I am no spy; but I am an officer of
the Begum's army, come out from Lucknow to gain reliable information of
the strength of the army and siege-train being brought against us.I am
the chief engineer of the army of Lucknow, and came out on a
reconnoitring expedition, but Allah has not blessed my enterprise.I
intended to have left on my return to Lucknow this evening, and if fate
had been propitious, I would have reached it before sunrise to-morrow,
for I had got all the information which was wanted; but I was tempted to
visit Oonao once more, being on the direct road to Lucknow, because I
was anxious to see whether the siege-train and ammunition-park had
commenced to move, and it was my misfortune to encounter that son of a
defiled mother who denounced me as a spy.A contemptible wretch who, to
save his own neck from the gallows (for he first sold the English), now
wishes to divert attention from his former rascality by selling the
lives of his own countrymen and co-religionists; but Allah is just, he
will yet reap the reward of his treachery in the fires of Jehunnum.[41]

"You ask me," continued the man, "what my name is, and state that you
intend to write an account of my misfortune to your friends in Scotland.The people of England,--and by England I mean
Scotland as well--are just, and some of them may pity the fate of this
servant of Allah.I have friends both in London and in Edinburgh, for I
have twice visited both places.I belong to
one of the best families of Rohilcund, and was educated in the Bareilly
College, and took the senior place in all English subjects.From
Bareilly College I passed to the Government Engineering College at
Roorkee, and studied engineering for the Company's service, and passed
out the senior student of my year, having gained many marks in excess of
all the European pupils, both civil and military.I was nominated to the rank of _jemadar_, of the Company's
engineers, and sent to serve with a company on detached duty on the hill
roads as a native commissioned officer, but actually subordinate to a
European sergeant, a man who was my inferior in every way, except,
perhaps, in mere brute strength, a man of little or no education, who
would never have risen above the grade of a working-joiner in England.Like most ignorant men in authority, he exhibited all the faults of the
Europeans which most irritate and disgust us, arrogance, insolence, and
selfishness.Unless you learn the language of my countrymen, and mix
with the better-educated people of this country, you will never
understand nor estimate at its full extent the mischief which one such
man does to your national reputation.One such example is enough to
confirm all that your worst enemies can say about your national
selfishness and arrogance, and makes the people treat your pretensions
to liberality and sympathy as mere hypocrisy.I had not joined the
Company's service from any desire for wealth, but from the hope of
gaining honourable service; yet on the very threshold of that service I
met with nothing but disgrace and dishonour, having to serve under a man
whom I hated, yea, worse than hated, whom I despised.I wrote to my
father, and requested his permission to resign, and he agreed with me
that I the descendant of princes, could not serve the Company under
conditions such as I have described.I resigned the service and returned
home, intending to offer my services to his late Majesty
Nussir-ood-Deen, King of Oude; but just when I reached Lucknow I was
informed that his Highness Jung Bahadoor of Nepal, who is now at
Goruckpore with an army of Goorkhas coming to assist in the loot of
Lucknow, was about to visit England, and required a secretary well
acquainted with the English language.I at once applied for the post,
and being well backed by recommendations both from native princes and
English officials, I secured the appointment, and in the suite of the
Maharaja I landed in England for the first time, and, among other
places, we visited Edinburgh, where your regiment, the Ninety-Third
Highlanders, formed the guard of honour for the reception of his
Highness.Little did I think when I saw a kilted regiment for the first
time, that I should ever be a prisoner in their tents in the plains of
Hindustan; but who can predict or avoid his fate?"Well, I returned to India, and filled several posts at different native
courts till 1854, when I was again asked to visit England in the suite
of Azeemoolla Khan, whose name you must have often heard in connection
with this mutiny and rebellion.On the death of the Peishwa, the Nana
had appointed Azeemoolla Khan to be his agent.He, like myself, had
received a good education in English, under Gunga Deen, head-master of
the Government school at Cawnpore.Azeemoolla was confident that, if he
could visit England, he would be able to have the decrees of Lord
Dalhousie against his master reversed, and when I joined him he was
about to start for England, well supplied with money to engage the best
lawyers, and also to bribe high officials, if necessary.But I need not
give you any account of our mission.You already know that, so far as
London drawing-rooms went, it proved a social success, but as far as
gaining our end a political failure; and we left England after spending
over L50,000, to return to India _via_ Constantinople in 1855.From
Constantinople we visited the Crimea, where we witnessed the assault and
defeat of the English on the 18th of June, and were much struck by the
wretched state of both armies in front of Sebastopol.Thence we returned
to Constantinople, and there met certain real or pretended Russian
agents, who made large promises of material support if Azeemoolla could
stir up a rebellion in India.It was then that I and Azeemoolla formed
the resolution of attempting to overthrow the Company's Government, and,
_Shook'r Khooda!_ we have succeeded in doing that; for from the
newspapers which you lent me, I see that the Company's _raj_ has gone,
and that their charter for robbery and confiscation will not be renewed.Although we have failed to wrest the country from the English, I hope we
have done some good, and that our lives will not be sacrificed in vain;
for I believe direct government under the English parliament will be
more just than was that of the Company, and that there is yet a future
before my oppressed and downtrodden countrymen, although I shall not
live to see it."I do not speak, _sahib_, to flatter you or to gain your favour.I have
already gained that, and I know that you cannot help me any farther than
you are doing, and that if you could, your sense of duty would not let
you.I know I must die; but the unexpected kindness which you have shown
to me has caused me to speak my mind.I came to this tent with hatred in
my heart, and curses on my lips; but your kindness to me, unfortunate,
has made me, for the second time since I left Lucknow, ashamed of the
atrocities committed during this rebellion.The first time was at
Cawnpore a few days ago, when Colonel Napier of the Engineers was
directing the blowing up of the Hindoo temples on the Cawnpore _ghat_,
and a deputation of Hindoo priests came to him to beg that the temples
might not be destroyed.'Now, listen to me,' said Colonel Napier in
reply to them; 'you were all here when our women and children were
murdered, and you also well know that we are not destroying these
temples for vengeance, but for military considerations connected with
the safety of the bridge of boats.But if any man among you can prove to
me that he did a single act of kindness to any Christian man, woman, or
child, nay, if he can even prove that he uttered one word of
intercession for the life of any one of them, I pledge myself to spare
the temple where he worships.'I was standing in the crowd close to
Colonel Napier at the time, and I thought it was bravely spoken.There
was no reply, and the cowardly Brahmins slunk away.Napier gave the
signal and the temples leaped into the air; and I was so impressed with
the justness of Napier's remarks that I too turned away, ashamed."On this I asked him, "Were you in Cawnpore when the Mutiny broke out?"To which he replied: "No, thank God!I was in my home in Rohilcund; and
my hands are unstained by the blood of any one, excepting those who have
fallen in the field of battle.I knew that the storm was about to burst,
and had gone to place my wife and children in safety, and I was in my
village when I heard the news of the mutinies at Meerut and Bareilly.I
immediately hastened to join the Bareilly brigade, and marched with them
for Delhi.There I was appointed engineer-in-chief, and set about
strengthening the defences by the aid of a party of the Company's
engineers which had mutinied on the march from Roorkee to Meerut.I
remained in Delhi till it was taken by the English in September.I then
made my way to Lucknow with as many men as I could collect of the
scattered forces.We first marched to Muttra, where we were obliged to
halt till I threw a bridge of boats across the Jumna for the retreat of
the army.We had still a force of over thirty thousand men under the
command of Prince Feroz Shah and General Bukht Khan.As soon as I
reached Lucknow I was honoured with the post of chief-engineer.I was in
Lucknow in November when your regiment assisted to relieve the
Residency.I saw the horrible slaughter in the Secundrabagh.I had
directed the defences of that place the night before, and was looking
on from the Shah Nujeef when you assaulted it.I had posted over three
thousand of the best troops in Lucknow in the Secundrabagh, as it was
the key to the position, and not a man escaped.I nearly fainted; my
liver turned to water when I saw the green flag pulled down, and a
Highland bonnet set up on the flag-staff which I had erected the night
before.I knew then that all was over, and directed the guns of the Shah
Nujeef to open fire on the Secundrabagh.Since then I have planned and
superintended the construction of all the defensive works in and around
Lucknow.You will see them when you return, and if the sepoys and
artillerymen stand firmly behind them, many of the English army will
lose the number of their mess, as you call it, before you again become
masters of Lucknow."I then asked him if it was true that the man he had called Micky on our
first acquaintance had been one of the men employed by the Nana to
butcher the women and children at Cawnpore in July?To this he replied:
"I believe it is true, but I did not know this when I employed him; he
was merely recommended to me as a man on whom I could depend.If I had
known then that he was a murderer of women and children, I should have
had nothing to do with him, for it is he who has brought bad luck on me;
it is my _kismut_, and I must suffer.Your English proverb says, 'You
cannot touch pitch and escape defilement,' and I must suffer; Allah is
just.It is the conduct of wretches such as these that has brought the
anger of Allah on our cause."On this I asked him if he knew whether
there was any truth in the report of the European women having been
dishonoured before being murdered."_Sahib_," he replied, "you are a
stranger to this country or you would not ask such a question.Any one
who knows anything of the customs of this country and the strict rules
of caste, knows that all such stories are lies, invented to stir up
race-hatred, as if we had not enough of that on both sides already.That
the women and children were cruelly murdered I admit, but not one of
them was dishonoured; and all the sentences written on the walls of the
houses in Cawnpore, such as, 'We are at the mercy of savages, who have
ravished young and old,' and such like, which have appeared in the
Indian papers and been copied from them into the English ones, are
malicious forgeries, and were written on the walls after the
re-occupation of Cawnpore by General Outram's and Havelock's forces.Although I was not there myself, I have spoken with many who were there,
and I know that what I tell you is true."I then asked him if he could give me any idea of the reason that had led
the Nana to order the commission of such a cold-blooded, cowardly crime."Asiatics," he said, "are weak, and their promises are not to be relied
on, but that springs more from indifference to obligations than from
prearranged treachery.When they make promises, they intend to keep
them; but when they find them inconvenient, they choose to forget them.And so it was, I believe, with the Nana Sahib.He intended to have
spared the women and children, but they had an enemy in his _zenana_ in
the person of a female fiend who had formerly been a slave-girl, and
there were many about the Nana (Azeemoolla Khan for one) who wished to
see him so irretrievably implicated in rebellion that there would be no
possibility for him to draw back.So this woman was powerfully supported
in her evil counsel, and obtained permission to have the English ladies
killed; and after the sepoys of the Sixth Native Infantry and the Nana's
own guard had refused to do the horrible work, this woman went and
procured the wretches who did it.This information I have from General
Tantia Topee, who quarrelled with the Nana on this same matter.What I
tell you is true: the murder of the European women and children at
Cawnpore was a woman's crime, for there is no fiend equal to a female
fiend; but what cause she had for enmity against the unfortunate ladies
I don't know--I never inquired."Those of my readers who were in India at the time may remember that
something about this slave-girl was said in all the native evidence
collected at the time on the subject of the Cawnpore massacre.I next asked Mahomed Ali Khan if he knew whether there was any truth in
the stories about General Wheeler's daughter having shot four or five
men with a revolver, and then leaped into the well at Cawnpore."All
these stories," was his answer, "are pure inventions with no foundation
of truth.General Wheeler's daughter is still alive, and is now in
Lucknow; she has become a Mussulmanee, and has married according to
Mahommedan law the man who protected her; whether she may ever return to
her own people I know not."In such conversation I passed the night with my prisoner, and towards
daybreak I permitted him to perform his ablutions and morning devotions,
after which he once more thanked me, and prayed that Allah might reward
me for my kindness to His oppressed servant.Once, and only once, did he
show any weakness, in alluding to his wife and two boys in their faraway
home in Rohilcund, when he remarked that they would never know the fate
of their unfortunate father.But he at once checked himself, saying, "I
have read French history as well as English; I must remember Danton, and
show no weakness."He then produced a gold ring which was concealed
among his hair, and asked me if I would accept it and keep it in
remembrance of him, in token of his gratitude.It was, he said, the only
thing he could give me, as everything of value had been taken from him
when he was arrested.He went on to say that the ring in question was
only a common one, not worth more than ten rupees, but that it had been
given to him by a holy man in Constantinople as a talisman, though the
charm had been broken when he had joined the unlucky man who was his
fellow-prisoner.I accepted the ring, which he placed on my finger with
a blessing and a prayer for my preservation, and he told me to look on
it and remember Mahomed Khan when I was in front of the fortifications
of Lucknow, and no evil would befall me.He had hardly finished speaking
when a guard from the provost-marshal came with an order to take over
the prisoners, and I handed this man over with a sincere feeling of pity
for his fate.Immediately after, I received orders that the division would march at
sunrise for Lucknow, and that my party was to join the rear-guard, after
the ammunition-park and siege-train had moved on.The sun was high in
the heavens before we left the encamping-ground, and in passing under a
tree on the side of the Cawnpore and Lucknow road, I looked up, and was
horrified to see my late prisoner and his companion hanging stark and
stiffened corpses!I could hardly repress a tear as I passed.But on the
11th of March, in the assault on the Begum's Kothee, I remembered
Mahomed Ali Khan and looked on the ring.I am thankful to say that I
went through the rest of the campaign without a scratch, and the
thoughts of my kindness to this unfortunate man certainly did not
inspire me with any desire to shirk danger.I still have the ring, the
only piece of Mutiny plunder I ever possessed, and shall hand it down to
my children together with the history of Mahomed Ali Khan.FOOTNOTES:

[37] Butler.[38] It must also be remembered that these officials knew much more of
the terrible facts attending the Mutiny--of the wholesale murder (and
even worse) of English women and the slaughter of English children--than
the rank and file were permitted to hear; and that they were also, both
from their station and their experience, far better able to decide the
measures best calculated to crush the imminent danger threatening our
dominion in India.Among the sepoys the word usually signified an Afghan or
Caubuli.[41] This very man who denounced Jamie Green as a spy was actually
hanged in Bareilly in the following May for having murdered his master
in that station when the Mutiny first broke out.CHAPTER XI

THE SIEGE OF LUCKNOW--SIR COLIN APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE NINETY-THIRD
--ASSAULT ON THE MARTINIERE--A "RANK" JOKE.After leaving Oonao our division under Sir Edward Lugard reached
Buntera, six miles from the Alumbagh, on the 27th of February, and
halted there till the 2nd of March, when we marched to the Dilkoosha,
encamping a short distance from the palace barely beyond reach of the
enemy's guns, for they were able at times to throw round-shot into our
camp.We then settled down for the siege and capture of Lucknow; but the
work before us was considered tame and unimportant when compared with
that of the relief of the previous November.Every soldier in the camp
clearly recognised that the capture of the doomed city was simply a
matter of time,--a few days more or less--and the task before us a mere
matter of routine, nothing to be compared to the exciting exertions
which we had to put forth for the relief of our countrywomen and their
children.At the time of the annexation of Oude Lucknow was estimated to contain
from eight to nine hundred thousand inhabitants, or as many as Delhi and
Benares put together.The camp and bazaars of our force were full of
reports of the great strength and determination of the enemy, and
certainly all the chiefs of Oude, Mahommedan and Hindoo, had joined the
standard of the Begum and had sworn to fight for their young king Brijis
Kuddur.All Oude was therefore still against us, and we held only the
ground covered by the British guns.Bazaar reports estimated the enemy's
strength at from two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand
fighting men, with five hundred guns in position; but in the
Commander-in-Chief's camp the strength of the enemy was computed at
sixty thousand regulars, mutineers who had lately served the Company,
and about seventy thousand irregulars, matchlock-men, armed police,
dacoits, etc., making a total of one hundred and thirty thousand
fighting men.To fight this large army, sheltered behind entrenchments
and loophooled walls, the British force, even after being joined by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas, mustered only about thirty-one thousand men of all
arms, and one hundred and sixty-four guns.From the heights of the Dilkoosha in the cool of the early morning,
Lucknow, with its numerous domed mosques, minarets, and palaces, looked
very picturesque.I don't think I ever saw a prettier scene than that
presented on the morning of the 3rd of March, 1858, when the sun rose,
and Captain Peel and his Blue-jackets were getting their heavy guns,
68-pounders, into position.From the Dilkoosha, even without the aid of
telescopes, we could see that the defences had been greatly
strengthened since we retired from Lucknow in November, and I called to
mind the warning of Jamie Green, that if the enemy stood to their guns
like men behind those extensive earthworks, many of the British force
would lose the number of their mess before we could take the city; and
although the Indian papers which reached our camp affected to sneer at
the Begum, Huzrut Mahal, and the legitimacy of her son Brijis Kuddur,
whom the mutineers had proclaimed King of Oude, they had evidently the
support of the whole country, for every chief and _zemindar_ of any
importance had joined them.On the morning after we had pitched our camp in the Dilkoosha park, I
went out with Sergeant Peter Gillespie, our deputy provost-marshal, to
take a look round the bazaars, and just as we turned a corner on our way
back to camp, we met some gentlemen in civilian dress, one of whom
turned out to be Mr.Russell, the _Times'_ correspondent, whom we never
expected to have seen in India.I never did think of meeting you here,
but I am right glad to see you, and so will all our boys be!"After a
short chat and a few inquiries about the regiment, Mr.Russell asked
when we expected to be in Lucknow, to which Peter Gillespie replied:
"Well, I dinna ken, sir, but when Sir Colin likes to give the order,
we'll just advance and take it."I may here mention that Sergeant
Gillespie lived to go through the Mutiny, and the cholera epidemic in
Peshawar in 1862, only to die of hydrophobia from the bite of a pet dog
in Sialkote years after, when he was about to retire on his sergeant's
pension.I mention this because Peter Gillespie was a well-known
character in the old regiment; he had served on the staff of the
provost-marshal throughout the Crimean war, and, so far as I now
remember, Colonel Ewart and Sergeant Gillespie were the only two men in
the regiment who gained the Crimean medal with the four clasps, for
Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, and Sebastopol.On the 4th of March the Ninety-Third, a squadron of the Ninth Lancers,
and a battery of artillery, were marched to the banks of the Goomtee
opposite Beebeepore House, to form a guard for the engineers engaged in
throwing a pontoon bridge across the Goomtee.The weather was now very
hot in the day-time, and as we were well beyond the range of the enemy's
guns, we were allowed to undress by companies and bathe in the river.As
far as I can remember, we were two days on this duty.During the
forenoon of the second day the Commander-in-Chief visited us, and the
regiment fell in to receive him, because, he said, he had something of
importance to communicate.When formed up, Sir Colin told us that he had
just received despatches from home, and among them a letter from the
Queen in which the Ninety-Third was specially mentioned.He then pulled
the letter out of his pocket, and read the paragraph alluded to, which
ran as follows, as nearly as I remembered to note it down after it was
read: "The Queen wishes Sir Colin to convey the expression of her great
admiration and gratitude to all European as well as native troops who
have fought so nobly and so gallantly for the relief of Lucknow, amongst
whom the Queen is rejoiced to see the Ninety-Third Highlanders."Colonel
Leith-Hay at once called for three cheers for her Majesty the Queen,
which were given with hearty good-will, followed by three more for the
Commander-in-Chief.The colonel then requested Sir Colin to return the
thanks of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of the
regiment to her Majesty the Queen for her most gracious message, and for
her special mention of the Ninety-Third, an honour which no one serving
in the regiment would ever forget.To this Sir Colin replied that
nothing would give him greater pleasure than to comply with this
request; but he had still more news to communicate.He had also a letter
from his Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge to read to us, which he
proceeded to do as follows: "One line in addition to my letter addressed
to you this morning, to say that, in consequence of the Colonelcy of the
Ninety-Third Highlanders having become vacant by the death of General
Parkinson, I have recommended the Queen to remove you to the command of
that distinguished and gallant corps, with which you have been so much
associated, not alone at the present moment in India, but also during
the whole of the campaign in the Crimea.I thought such an arrangement
would be agreeable to yourself, and I know that it is the highest
compliment that her Majesty could pay to the Ninety-Third Highlanders to
see their dear old chief at their head."As soon as Sir Colin had read
this letter, the whole regiment cheered till we were hoarse; and when
Sir Colin's voice could again be heard, he called for the master-tailor
to go to the headquarters camp to take his measure to send home for a
uniform of the regiment for him, feather bonnet and all complete; and
about eighteen months afterwards Sir Colin visited us in Subathoo,
dressed in the regimental uniform then ordered.Early on the 7th of March General Outram's division crossed the Goomtee
by the bridge of boats, and we returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha.About mid-day we could see Outram's division, of which the Seventy-Ninth
Cameron Highlanders formed one of the infantry corps, driving the enemy
before them in beautiful style.We saw also the Queen's Bays, in their
bright scarlet uniform and brass helmets, make a splendid charge,
scattering the enemy like sheep, somewhere about the place where the
buildings of the Upper India Paper Mills now stand.In this charge Major
Percy Smith and several men galloped right through the enemy's lines,
and were surrounded and killed.Spies reported that Major Smith's head
was cut off, and, with his helmet, plume, and uniform, paraded through
the streets of Lucknow as the head of the Commander-in-Chief.But the
triumph of the enemy was short.On the 8th General Outram was firmly
established on the north bank of the Goomtee, with a siege-train of
twenty-two heavy guns, with which he completely turned and enfiladed the
enemy's strong position.On the 9th of March we were ordered to take our dinners at twelve
o'clock, and shortly after that hour our division, consisting of the
Thirty-Eighth, Forty-Second, Fifty-Third, Ninetieth, Ninety-Third, and
Fourth Punjab Infantry, was under arms, screened by the Dilkoosha palace
and the garden walls round it, and Peel's Blue-jackets were pouring shot
and shell, with now and again a rocket, into the Martiniere as fast as
ever they could load.About two o'clock the order was given for the
advance--the Forty-Second to lead and the Ninety-Third to support; but
we no sooner emerged from the shelter of the palace and garden-walls
than the orderly advance became a rushing torrent.Both regiments dashed
down the <DW72> abreast, and the earthworks, trenches, and rifle-pits in
front of the Martiniere were cleared, the enemy flying before us as fast
as their legs could carry them.We pursued them right through the
gardens, capturing their first line of works along the canal in front of
Banks's bungalow and the Begum's palace.There we halted for the night,
our heavy guns and mortar-batteries being advanced from the Dilkoosha;
and I, with some men from my company, was sent on piquet to a line of
unroofed huts in front of one of our mortar-batteries, for fear the
enemy from the Begum's palace might make a rush on the mortars.This
piquet was not relieved till the morning of the 11th, when I learned
that my company had been sent back as camp-guards, the captains of
companies having drawn lots for this service, as all were equally
anxious to take part in the assault on the Begum's palace, and it was
known the Ninety-Third were to form the storming-party.As soon as the
works should be breached, I and the men who were with me on the
advance-piquet were to be sent to join Captain M'Donald's company,
instead of going back to our own in camp.After being relieved from
piquet, our little party set about preparing some food.Our own company
having gone back to camp, no rations had been drawn for us, and our
haversacks were almost empty; so I will here relate a mild case of
cannibalism.Of the men of my own company who were with me on this
piquet one was Andrew M'Onvill,--Handy Andy, as he was called in the
regiment--a good-hearted, jolly fellow, and as full of fun and practical
jokes as his namesake, Lever's hero,--a thorough Paddy from Armagh, a
soldier as true as the steel of a Damascus blade or a Scotch Andrea
Ferrara.When last I heard of him, I may add, he was sergeant-major of a
New Zealand militia regiment.Others were Sandy Proctor, soldier-servant
to Dr.Munro, and George Patterson, the son of the carrier of Ballater
in Aberdeenshire.I forget who the rest were, but we were joined by John
M'Leod, the pipe-major, and one or two more.We got into an empty hut,
well sheltered from the bullets of the enemy, and Handy Andy sallied out
on a foraging expedition for something in the way of food.He had a
friend in the Fifty-Third who was connected in some way with the
quarter-master's department, and always well supplied with extra
provender.The Fifty-Third were on our right, and there Handy Andy found
his friend, and returned with a good big steak, cut from an artillery
gun-bullock which had been killed by a round-shot; also some sheep's
liver and a haversack full of biscuits, with plenty of pumpkin to make
a good stew.There was no lack of cooking-pots in the huts around, and
plenty of wood for fuel, so we kindled a fire, and very soon had an
excellent stew in preparation.But the enemy pitched some shells into
our position, and one burst close to a man named Tim Drury, a big stout
fellow, killing him on the spot.I forget now which company he belonged
to, but his body lay where he fell, just outside our hut, with one thigh
nearly torn away.My readers must not for a moment think that such a
picture in the foreground took away our appetites in the least.There is
nothing like a campaign for making one callous and selfish, and
developing the qualities of the wild beast in one's nature; and the
thought which rises uppermost is--Well, it is his turn now, and it may
be mine next, and there is no use in being down-hearted!Our steak had
been broiled to a turn, and our stew almost cooked, when we noticed
tiffin and breakfast combined arrive for the European officers of the
Fourth Punjab Regiment, and some others who were waiting sheltered by
the walls of a roofless hut near where we were.Among them was a young
fellow, Lieutenant Fitzgerald Cologan, attached to some native regiment,
a great favourite with the Ninety-Third for his pluck.John M'Leod at
once proposed that Handy Andy should go and offer him half of our
broiled steak, and ask him for a couple of bottles of beer for our
dinner, as it might be the last time we should have the chance of
drinking his health.He and the other officers with him accepted the
steak with thanks, and Andy returned, to our no small joy, with two
quart bottles of Bass's beer.But, unfortunately he had attracted the
attention of Charley F., the greatest glutton in the Ninety-Third, who
was so well known for his greediness that no one would chum with him.Charley was a long-legged, humpbacked, cadaverous-faced, bald-headed
fellow, who had joined the regiment as a volunteer from the
Seventy-Second before we left Dover in the spring of 1857, and on
account of his long legs and humpback, combined with the inordinate
capacity of his stomach and an incurable habit of grumbling, he had been
re-christened the "Camel," before we had proceeded many marches with
that useful animal in India.Our mutual congratulations were barely over
on the acquisition of the two bottles of beer, when, to our
consternation, we saw the Camel dodging from cover to cover, as the
enemy were keeping up a heavy fire on our position, and if any one
exposed himself in the least, a shower of bullets was sent whistling
round him.However, the Camel, with a due regard to the wholeness of his
skin, steadily made way towards our hut.We all knew that if he were
admitted to a share of our stew, very little would be left for
ourselves.John M'Leod and I suggested that we should, at the risk of
quarrelling with him, refuse to allow him any share, but Handy Andy
said, "Leave him to me, and if a bullet doesn't knock him over as he
comes round the next corner, I'll put him off asking for a share of the
stew."Well, the Camel took good
care to dodge the bullets of Jack Pandy, and he no sooner reached a
sheltered place in front of the hut, than Andy called out: "Come along,
Charley, you are just in time; we got a slice of a nice steak from an
artillery-bullock this morning, and because it was too small alone for a
dinner for the four of us, we have just stewed it with a slice from Tim
Drury, and bedad it's first-rate!Tim tastes for all the world like
fresh pork"; and with that Andy picked out a piece of the sheep's liver
on the prongs of his fork, and offered it to Charley as part of Tim
Drury, at the same time requesting him not to mention the circumstance
to any one.This was too much for the Camel's stomach.He plainly
believed Andy, and turned away, as if he would be sick.However, he
recovered himself, and replied: "No, thank you; hungry as I am, it shall
never be in the power of any one to tell my auld mither in the Grass
Market o' Edinboro' that her Charley had become a cannibal!But if you
can spare me a drop of the beer I'll be thankful for it, for the sight
of your stew has made me feel unco' queer."We expressed our sorrow that
the beer was all drunk before we had seen Charley performing his oblique
advance, and Andy again pressed him to partake of a little of the stew;
but Charley refused to join, and sitting down in a sheltered spot in the
corner of our roofless mud-hut, made wry faces at the relish evinced by
the rest of us over our savoury stew.The Camel eventually discovered
that he had been made a fool of, and he never forgave us for cheating
him out of a share of the savoury mess.CHAPTER XII

ASSAULT ON THE BEGUM'S KOTHEE--DEATH OF CAPTAIN M'DONALD--MAJOR HODSON
WOUNDED--HIS DEATH


We had barely finished our meal when we noticed a stir among the
staff-officers, and a consultation taking place between General Sir
Edward Lugard, Brigadier Adrian Hope, and Colonel Napier.Suddenly the
order was given to the Ninety-Third to fall in.This was quietly done,
the officers taking their places, the men tightening their belts and
pressing their bonnets firmly on their heads, loosening the ammunition
in their pouches, and seeing that the springs of their bayonets held
tight.Thus we stood for a few seconds, when Brigadier Hope passed the
signal for the assault on the Begum's Kothee.Just before the signal was
given two men from the Fifty-Third rushed up to us with a soda-water
bottle full of grog.One of them was Lance-Corporal Robert Clary, who is
at present, I believe, police-sergeant in the Municipal Market,
Calcutta; the other was the friend of Andrew M'Onvill, who had supplied
us with the steaks for our "cannibal feast."I may mention that
Lance-Corporal Clary was the same man who led the party of the
Fifty-Third to capture the guns at the Kalee Nuddee bridge, and who
called out: "Three cheers for the Commander-in-Chief, boys," when Sir
Colin Campbell was threatening to send the regiment to the rear for
breach of orders.Clary was a County Limerick boy of the right sort,
such as filled the ranks of our Irish regiments of the old days.No
Fenian nor Home Ruler; but ever ready to uphold the honour of the
British Army by land or by sea, and to share the contents of his
haversack or his glass of grog with a comrade; one of those whom Scott
immortalises in _The Vision of Don Roderick_.from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,
      Mingling wild mirth with war's stern minstrelsy,
    His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,
      And moves to death with military glee!tameless, frank, and free,
      In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,
    Rough Nature's children, humorous as she.When Captain M'Donald, whose company we had joined, saw the two
Fifty-Third boys, he told them that they had better rejoin their own
regiment.Clary replied, "Sure, Captain, you don't mean it;" and seeing
Dr.Munro, our surgeon, busy giving directions to his assistants and
arranging bandages, etc., in a _dooly_, Clary went on:--"We have been
sent by Lieutenant Munro of our company to take care of his namesake
your doctor, who never thinks of himself, but is sure to be in the thick
of the fight, looking out for wounded men.You of the Ninety-Third don't
appreciate his worth.There's not another doctor in the army to equal
him or to replace him should he get knocked over in this scrimmage, and
we of the Fifty-Third have come to take care of him.""If that is the
case," said Captain M'Donald, "I'll allow you to remain; but you must
take care that no harm befalls our doctor, for he is a great friend of
mine."And with that Captain M'Donald stepped aside and plucked a rose
from a bush close by, (we were then formed up in what had been a
beautiful garden), and going up to Munro he gave him the flower saying,
"Good-bye, old friend, keep this for my sake."I have often recalled
this incident and wondered if poor Captain M'Donald had any presentiment
that he would be killed!Although he had been a captain for some years,
he was still almost a boy.He was a son of General Sir John M'Donald,
K.C.B., of Dalchosnie, Perthshire, and was wounded in his right arm
early in the day by a splinter from a shell, but he refused to go to the
rear, and remained at the head of his company, led it through the
breach, and was shot down just inside, two bullets striking him almost
at once, one right in his throat just over the breast-bone, as he was
waving his claymore and cheering on his company.After the fight was
over I made my way to where the dead were collected and cut off a lock
of his hair and sent it to a young lady, Miss M. E. Ainsworth, of
Inverighty House, Forfar, who, I knew, was acquainted with Captain
M'Donald's family.I intended the lock of hair for his mother, and I did
not know if his brother officers would think of sending any memento of
him.I don't know if ever the lock of hair reached his mother or not.When I went to do this I found Captain M'Donald's soldier-servant
crying beside the lifeless body of his late master, wringing his hands
and saying, "Oh!I never
saw a more girlish-looking face than his was in death; his features were
so regular, and looked strangely like those of a wax doll, which was, I
think, partly the effect of the wound in the throat.When Captain McDonald fell the company was led by the senior lieutenant,
and about twenty yards inside the breach in the outer rampart we were
stopped by a ditch nearly eighteen feet wide and at least twelve to
fourteen feet deep.It was easy enough to slide down to the bottom; the
difficulty was to get up on the other side!However, there was no
hesitation; the stormers dashed into the ditch, and running along to the
right in search of some place where we could get up on the inside, we
met part of the grenadier company headed by Lieutenant E. S. Wood, an
active and daring young officer.I may here mention that there were two
lieutenants of the name of Wood at this time in the Ninety-Third.One
belonged to my company; his name was S. E. Wood and he was severely
wounded at the relief of Lucknow and was, at the time of which I am
writing, absent from the regiment.The one to whom I now refer was
Lieutenant E. S. Wood of the grenadier company.When the two parties in
the ditch met, both in search of a place to get out, Mr.Wood got on the
shoulders of another grenadier and somehow scrambled up claymore in
hand.He was certainly the first man inside the inner works of the
Begum's palace, and when the enemy saw him emerge from the ditch they
fled to barricade doors and windows to prevent us getting into the
buildings.His action saved us, for the whole of us might have been shot
like rats in the ditch if they had attacked Mr.Wood, instead of flying
when they saw the tall grenadier claymore in hand.As soon as he saw the
coast clear the lieutenant lay down on the top of the ditch, and was
thus able to reach down and catch hold of the men's rifles by the bends
of the bayonets; and with the aid of the men below pushing up behind, we
were all soon pulled out of the ditch.When all were up, one of the men
turned to Mr.Wood and said: "If any officer in the regiment deserves to
get the Victoria Cross, sir, you do; for besides the risk you have run
from the bullets of the enemy, it's more than a miracle that you're not
shot by our own rifles; they're all on full-cock."Seizing loaded rifles on full-cock by the muzzles, and pulling more than
a score of men out of a deep ditch, was a dangerous thing to do; but no
one thought of the danger, nor did anyone think of even easing the
spring to half-cock, much less of firing his rifle off before being
pulled up.Wood escaped, and after getting his captaincy he
left the regiment and became Conservator of Forests in Oude.H. W. I. Wood, for
many years the well-known secretary to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.He has just lately retired on his pension; I wonder if he ever recalls
the danger he incurred from pulling his men out of the ditch of the
Begum's palace by the muzzles of their loaded rifles on full-cock!By the time we got out of the ditch we found every door and window of
the palace buildings barricaded, and every loophole defended by an
invisible enemy.But one barrier after another was forced, and men in
small parties, headed by the officers, got possession of the inner
square, where the enemy in large numbers stood ready for the struggle.But no thought of unequal numbers held us back.The command was given:
"Keep well together, men, and use the bayonet; give them the
Secundrabagh and the sixteenth of November over again."It raged for about two hours from court to court,
and from room to room; the pipe-major, John M'Leod, playing the pipes
inside as calmly as if he had been walking round the officers' mess-tent
at a regimental festival.When all was over, General Sir Edward Lugard,
who commanded the division, complimented the pipe-major on his coolness
and bravery: "Ah, sir," said John, "I knew our boys would fight all the
better when cheered by the bagpipes.""Within about two hours from the time the signal for the assault was
given, over eight hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead within the
inner court, and no quarter was sought or given.By this time we were
broken up in small parties in a series of separate fights, all over the
different detached buildings of the palace.Captain M'Donald being dead,
the men who had been on piquet with me joined a party under Lieutenant
Sergison, and while breaking in the door of a room, Mr.Sergison was
shot dead at my side with several men.When we had partly broken in the
door, I saw that there was a large number of the enemy inside the room,
well armed with swords and spears, in addition to fire-arms of all
sorts, and, not wishing to be either killed myself or have more of the
men who were with me killed, I divided my party, placing some at each
side of the door to shoot every man who showed himself, or attempted to
rush out.I then sent two men back to the breach, where I knew Colonel
Napier with his engineers were to be found, to get a few bags of
gunpowder with slow-matches fixed, to light and pitch into the room.Instead of finding Napier, the two men sent by me found the redoubtable
Major Hodson who had accompanied Napier as a volunteer in the storming
of the palace.Hodson did not wait for the powder-bags, but, after
showing the men where to go for them, came running up himself, sabre in
hand.I pointed to the door of the
room, and Hodson, shouting 'Come on!'I implored
him not to do so, saying, 'It's certain death; wait for the powder; I've
sent men for powder-bags,' Hodson made a step forward, and I put out my
hand to seize him by the shoulder to pull him out of the line of the
doorway, when he fell back shot through the chest.He gasped out a few
words, either 'Oh, my wife!'--I cannot now rightly
remember--but was immediately choked by blood.At the time I thought the
bullet had passed through his lungs, but since then I have seen the
memoir written by his brother, the Rev.George H. Hodson, Vicar of
Enfield, in which it is stated that the bullet passed through his liver.However, I assisted to get him lifted into a _dooly_ (by that time the
bearers had got in and were collecting the wounded who were unable to
walk), and I sent him back to where the surgeons were, fully expecting
that he would be dead before anything could be done for him.It will
thus be seen that the assertion that Major Hodson was looting when he
was killed is untrue.No looting had been commenced, not even by Jung
Bahadoor's Goorkhas.That Major Hodson was killed through his own
rashness cannot be denied; but for any one to say that he was looting is
a cruel slander on one of the bravest of Englishmen."Shortly after I had lifted poor Hodson into the _dooly_ and sent him
away in charge of his orderly, the two men who had gone for the powder
came up with several bags, with slow-matches fixed in them.These we
ignited, and then pitched the bags in through the door.Two or three
bags very soon brought the enemy out, and they were bayoneted down
without mercy.One of the men who were with me was, I think, Mr.Rule,
who is now _sans_ a leg, and employed by the G.I.P.Railway in Bombay,
but was then a powerful young man of the light company.Rule rushed in
among the rebels, using both bayonet and butt of his rifle, shouting,
"Revenge for the death of Hodson!"and he killed more than half the men
single-handed.By this time we had been over two hours inside the
breach, and almost all opposition had ceased.Lieutenant and Adjutant
"Willie" MacBean, as he was known to the officers, and "Paddy" MacBean
to the men, encountered a _havildar_, a _naik_, and nine sepoys at one
gate, and killed the whole eleven, one after the other.The _havildar_
was the last; and by the time he got out through the narrow gate,
several men came to the assistance of MacBean, but he called to them not
to interfere, and the _havildar_ and he went at it with their swords.At
length MacBean made a feint cut, but instead gave the point, and put his
sword through the chest of his opponent.For this MacBean got the
Victoria Cross, mainly, I believe, because Sir Edward Lugard, the
general in command of the division, was looking down from the ramparts
above and saw the whole affair.I don't think that MacBean himself
thought he had done anything extraordinary.He was an Inverness-shire
ploughman before he enlisted, and rose from the ranks to command the
regiment, and died a major-general.There were still a number of old
soldiers in the regiment who had been privates with MacBean when I
enlisted, and many anecdotes were related about him.One of these was
that when MacBean first joined, he walked with a rolling gait, and the
drill-corporal was rather abusive with him when learning his drill.At
last he became so offensive that another recruit proposed to MacBean,
who was a very powerful man, that they should call the corporal behind
the canteen in the barrack-yard and give him a good thrashing, to which
proposal MacBean replied: "Toots, toots, man, that would never do.I am
going to command this regiment before I leave it, and it would be an ill
beginning to be brought before the colonel for thrashing the
drill-corporal!"MacBean kept to his purpose, and _did_ live to command
the regiment, going through every rank from private to major-general.I
have seen it stated that he was a drummer-boy in the regiment, but that
is not correct.He was kept seven years lance-corporal, partly because
promotion went slow in the Ninety-Third, but several were promoted over
him because, at the time of the disruption in the Church of Scotland,
MacBean joined the Free Kirk party.This fact may appear strange to
military readers of the present day with our short service and
territorial regiments; but in the times of which I am writing, as I have
before mentioned, the Ninety-Third was constituted as much after the
arrangements of a Highland parish as those of a regiment in the army;
and, to use the words of old Colonel Sparks who commanded, MacBean was
passed over four promotions because "He was a d--d Free Kirker."But I must hark back to my story and to the Begum's palace on the
evening of the 11th of March, 1858.By the time darkness set in all
opposition had ceased, but there were still numbers of the mutineers
hiding in the rooms.Our loss was small compared with that inflicted on
the enemy.Our regiment had one captain, one lieutenant, and thirteen
rank and file killed; Lieutenant Grimston, Ensign Hastie, and
forty-five men wounded.Many of the wounded died afterwards; but eight
hundred and sixty of the enemy lay dead in the centre court alone, and
many hundreds more were killed in the different enclosures and
buildings.That night we bivouacked in the courts of the palace, placing
strong guards all round.When daylight broke on the morning of the 12th
of March, the sights around were horrible.I have already mentioned that
many sepoys had to be dislodged from the close rooms around the palace
by exploding bags of gunpowder among them, and this set fire to their
clothing and to whatever furniture there was in the rooms; and when day
broke on the 12th, there were hundreds of bodies all round, some still
burning and others half-burnt, and the stench was sickening.However,
the Begum's palace was the key to the enemy's position.During the day
large parties of camp-followers were brought in to drag out the dead of
the enemy, and throw them into the ditch which had given us so much
trouble to cross, and our batteries were advanced to bombard the
Imambara and Kaiserbagh.During the forenoon of the 12th, I remember seeing Mr.Russell of _The
Times_ going round making notes, and General Lugard telling him to take
care and not to attempt to go into any dark room for fear of being
"potted" by concealed Pandies.Many such were hunted out during the day,
and as there was no quarter for them they fought desperately.We had
one sergeant killed at this work and several men wounded.During the
afternoon a divisional order by General Sir Edward Lugard was read to
us, as follows:--

"Major-General Sir Edward Lugard begs to thank Brigadier the Honourable
Adrian Hope, Colonel Leith-Hay, and the officers and men of the
Ninety-Third who exclusively carried the position known as the Begum's
Kothee.No words are sufficient to express the gallantry, devotion, and
fearless intrepidity displayed by every officer and man in the regiment.The Major-General will not fail to bring their conduct prominently to
the notice of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief."During the day Sir Colin himself visited the position, and told us that
arrangements would be made for our relief the following day, and on
Saturday, the 13th, we returned to camp and rested all the following
Sunday.So far as I remember, the two men of the Fifty-Third,
Lance-Corporal Clary and his comrade, remained with us till after the
place was taken, and then returned to their own regiment when the
fighting was over, reporting to Lieutenant Munro that they had gone to
take care of his brother, Doctor Munro of the Ninety-Third.There were many individual acts of bravery performed during the assault,
and it is difficult to single them out.But before closing this chapter
I may relate a rather laughable incident that happened to a man of my
company named Johnny Ross.He was a little fellow, and there were two
of the same name in the company, one tall and the other short, so they
were named respectively John and Johnny.Before falling in for the
assault on the Begum's palace, Johnny Ross and George Puller, with some
others, had been playing cards in a sheltered corner, and in some way
quarrelled over the game.When the signal was given for the "fall in,"
Puller and Ross were still arguing the point in dispute, and Puller told
Ross to "shut up."Just at that very moment a spent bullet struck Ross
in the mouth, knocking in four of his front teeth.Johnny thought it was
Puller who had struck him, and at once returned the blow; when Puller
quietly replied, "You d--d fool, it was not I who struck you; you've got
a bullet in your mouth."And so it was: Johnny Ross put up his hand to
his mouth, and spat out four front teeth and a leaden bullet.He at once
apologised to Puller for having struck him, and added, "How will I
manage to bite my cartridges the noo?"Those were the days of
muzzle-loading cartridges, which had to be torn open with the teeth when
loading.We returned to our tents at the Dilkoosha on Saturday, the 13th, and the
whole regiment formed a funeral party for our killed near the palace;
but I could not find the place on my late visit to Lucknow, nor do I
think any monument marks it.When going round the Dilkoosha heights I
found no trace of the graves of the Ninety-Third, nor was there any one
who could point them out to me.The guide took me to see the grave of
Major Hodson.I found it in excellent preservation, with a wall round
it, and an iron gate to it near the entrance to the Martiniere College.This care had been taken of Hodson's last resting-place by his friend,
Lord Napier of Magdala, and I cut a branch from the cypress-tree planted
at his head, and posted half of it to the address of his brother in
England.NOTE

HODSON OF HODSON'S HORSE

      Sir Colin Campbell wrote thus at the time of Major Hodson's
      death: "The whole army, which admired his talents, his
      bravery, and his military skill, deplores his loss.... I
      attended his funeral yesterday evening, in order to show
      what respect I could to the memory of one of the most
      brilliant officers under my command.--(Signed) C.
      CAMPBELL, Commander-in-Chief in East Indies."The following tributes were also paid to Hodson's memory at
      the time.From a leading article in _The Times_: "The
      country will receive with lively regret the news that the
      gallant Major Hodson, who has given his name to an
      invincible and almost ubiquitous body of cavalry, was killed
      in the attack on Lucknow.Major Hodson has been from the
      very beginning of this war fighting everywhere and against
      any odds with all the spirit of a Paladin of old.His most
      remarkable exploit, the capture of the King of Delhi and his
      two sons, astonished the world by its courage and coolness.Hodson was indeed a man who, from his romantic daring and
      his knowledge of the Asiatic character, was able to beat the
      natives at their own weapons."From _Blackwood's Magazine_: "Then fell one of the bravest
      in the Indian Army, an officer whose name has been brought
      too often before the public by those in high command to need
      my humble word of praise.There was not a man before Delhi
      who did not know Hodson; always active, always cheery, it
      did one's heart good to look at his face when all felt how
      critical was our position."CHAPTER XIII

JUNG BAHADOOR--GUNPOWDER--THE MOHURRUM AT LUCKNOW--LOOT


On the return of the regiment to camp at the Dilkoosha on the 13th of
March I was glad to get back to my own company.The men were mortified
because they had not shared in the honour of the assault on the Begum's
palace; but as some compensation the company had formed the
guard-of-honour for the reception of the Maharaja Jung Bahadoor,
Commander-in-Chief of the Nepaulese Army, who had just reached Lucknow
and been received in state by Sir Colin Campbell on the afternoon of the
11th, at the moment when the regiment was engaged in the assault on the
palace.The _durbar_ had at first proved a rather stiff ceremonial
affair, but Jung Bahadoor and his officers had hardly been presented and
taken their seats, when a commotion was heard outside, and Captain Hope
Johnstone, aide-de-camp to General Sir William Mansfield, covered with
powder-smoke and the dust of battle, strode up the centre of the
guard-of-honour with a message to the Commander-in-Chief from Mansfield,
informing him that the Ninety-Third had taken the Begum's palace, the
key of the enemy's position, with slight loss to themselves, but that
they had killed over a thousand of the enemy.This announcement put an
end to all ceremony on the part of Sir Colin, who jumped to his feet,
rubbing his hands, and calling out, "I knew they would do it!I knew my
boys of the Ninety-Third would do it!"Then telling Captain Metcalfe to
interpret the news to the Maharaja, and pointing to the guard-of-honour,
Sir Colin said: "Tell him that these men are part of the regiment that
has done this daring feat.Tell him also that they are _my_ regiment;
I'm their colonel!"The Maharaja looked pleased, and replied that he
remembered having seen the regiment when he visited England in 1852.As
I have already said, the Ninety-Third had formed a guard-of-honour for
him when in Edinburgh, and there were still many men in the regiment who
remembered seeing Jung Bahadoor.There was an oft-repeated story among
the old soldiers that the Maharaja was so pleased at the sight of them
that he had proposed to buy the whole regiment, and was somewhat
surprised to learn that British soldiers were volunteers and could not
be sold, even to gratify the Maharaja of Nepaul.After returning to camp on the 13th of March, the regiment was allowed
to rest till the 17th, but returned to the city on the morning of the
18th, taking up a position near the Imambara and the Kaiserbagh, both of
which had been captured when we were in camp.We relieved the
Forty-Second, and the sights that then met our eyes in the streets of
Lucknow defy description.The city was in the hands of plunderers;
Europeans and Sikhs, Goorkhas, and camp-followers of every class, aided
by the scum of the native population.Every man in fact was doing what
was right in his own eyes, and "Hell broke loose" is the only phrase in
the English language that can give one who has never seen such a sight
any idea of the scenes in and around the Imambara, the Kaiserbagh, and
adjacent streets.The Sikhs and Goorkhas were by far the most proficient
plunderers, because they instinctively knew where to look for the most
valuable loot.The European soldiers did not understand the business,
and articles that might have proved a fortune to many were readily
parted with for a few rupees in cash and a bottle of grog.But the
gratuitous destruction of valuable property that could not be carried
off was appalling.Colour-Sergeant Graham, of Captain Burroughs'
company, rescued from the fire a bundle of Government-of-India
promissory notes to the value of over a _lakh_ of rupees,[42] and Mr.Kavanagh, afterwards discovering the rightful owner, secured for
Sergeant Graham a reward of five per cent on the amount.But with few
exceptions the men of the Ninety-Third got very little.I could fill a
volume on the plunder of Lucknow, and the sights which are still vividly
impressed on my memory; but others have written at length on this theme,
so I will leave it.Before I proceed to other subjects, and to make my recollections as
instructive as possible for young soldiers, I may mention some serious
accidents that happened through the explosions of gunpowder left behind
by the enemy.One most appalling accident occurred in the house of a
nobleman named Ushruf-ood-dowlah, in which a large quantity of gunpowder
had been left; this was accidentally exploded, killing two officers and
forty men of the Engineers, and a great number of camp-followers, of
whom no account was taken.The poor men who were not killed outright
were so horribly scorched that they all died in the greatest agony
within a few hours of the accident, and for days explosions with more or
less loss of life occurred all over the city.From the deplorable
accidents that happened, which reasonable care might have prevented, I
could enumerate the loss of over a hundred men, and I cannot too
strongly impress on young soldiers the caution required in entering
places where there is the least chance of coming across concealed
gunpowder.By the accident in the house of Ushruf-ood-dowlah, two of our
most distinguished and promising Engineer officers,--Captains Brownlow
and Clarke--lost their lives, with forty of the most valuable branch of
the service.All through the Mutiny I never forgot my own experience in
the Shah Nujeef (as related in the fifth chapter of these
reminiscences); and wherever I could prevent it, I never allowed men to
go into unexplored rooms with lighted pipes, or to force open locked
doors by the usual method of firing a loaded rifle into the lock.I
think there ought to be a chapter of instructions on this head in every
drill-book and soldiers' pocket-book.After the assault on a city like
Lucknow some license and plundering is inevitable, and where discipline
is relaxed accidents are sure to happen; but a judicious use of the
provost-marshal's cat would soon restore discipline and order.Whatever
opponents of the lash may say, my own firm opinion is that the
provost-marshal's cat is the only general to restore order in times like
those I am describing.I would have no courts-martial, drum-head or
otherwise; but simply give the provost-marshal a strong guard of picked
men and several sets of triangles, with full power to tie up every man,
no matter what his rank, caught plundering, and give him from one to
four dozen, not across the shoulders, but across the breech, as judicial
floggings are administered in our jails; and if these were combined with
roll-calls at short intervals, plundering, which is a most dangerous
pastime, would soon be put down.In time of war soldiers ought to be
taught to treat every house or room of an assaulted position as a
powder-magazine until explored.I am surprised that cautions on this
head have been so long overlooked.As before stated, the Ninety-Third did not get much plunder, but in
expelling the enemy from some mosques and other strong buildings near
the Imambara on the 21st of March, one company came across the
tomb-model or royal _tazia_, and the Mohurrum paraphernalia which had
been made at enormous expense for the celebration of the last Mohurrum
in Lucknow in 1857.The royal family and court of Lucknow were
_Sheeahs_: and to enable European readers to understand the value of
the plunder to which I allude, before entering on the actual details, I
will quote from the chapter on the celebration of the Mohurrum in
Lucknow in _The Private Life of an Eastern King_, by William Knighton, a
member of the household of his late Majesty Nussir-ood-Deen King of
Oude, a book which, I believe, is now out of print.Few people seem to
know the meaning of those symbols, the star and crescent or half-moon,
on Mahommedan standards or banners and on the domes of mosques or tombs
of deceased persons of importance, as also on the tomb-models, or
_tazias_ used in the celebration of the Mohurrum.For the explanation of
these symbols we must turn to the science of heraldry, which was well
known in the sixth century A.D., when Mahommed established his
religion.The star is meant to represent Mahommed himself, as the
prophet of God, and the crescent represents the Mahommedan religion,
which every sincere follower of the Prophet believes will eventually
become a full moon and cover the whole earth.The fanatical rites of the Mohurrum are celebrated on the
      anniversary of the death of two leaders of the faithful,
      near relatives of Mahommed himself, Hussun and Hoosein, and
      are observed by more than one-half the population of India
      as a period of deep humiliation and sorrow.The Mussulman
      faithful are divided into two sects, Sheeahs and the
      Soonies, who feel towards each other much as fanatical
      Protestants and Roman Catholics mutually do.The Sheeahs
      regard the deaths of Hussun and Hoosein as barbarous
      murders; the Soonies look on them as lawful executions of
      pretenders to supreme power by the reigning Caliph, the true
      head of the faithful.On the first day of the Mohurrum the
      vast population of Lucknow appears to be suddenly snatched
      away from all interests and employments in the affairs of
      this world; the streets are deserted; every one is shut up
      in his house, mourning with his family.On the second day
      the streets are crowded, but with people in mourning attire,
      parading the thoroughfares in funeral procession to the
      tomb-models set up here and there as tributes of respect to
      the memory of Hussun and Hoosein.These models, called
      _tazias_, are representations of the mausoleum at Kerbela
      where the two chiefs are buried.The _tazias_ are placed in
      an _imambara_ belonging to a chief, or in the house of some
      wealthy Mussulman.The _tazia_ belonging to the king of Oude
      was made for his Majesty's father, and was composed of
      panels of green glass fixed in gold mouldings, and was
      regarded as peculiarly holy.[I only take extracts from the
      chapter on the Mohurrum from the work I have named.The
      _tazia_ belonging to the king accompanied him from Lucknow
      on the annexation of Oude.]It is on record at Lucknow that
      the celebration of the Mohurrum often cost a reigning Nawab
      upwards of L300,000 or Rs.In Lucknow, before the
      Mutiny, it was believed that they had the true metal crest
      of the banner of Hoosein, a relic regarded as peculiarly
      sacred, and enshrined in a building called the Doorgah.The
      name of the charger which Hoosein rode when he was killed
      was Dhulldhull, represented in the procession of the
      Mohurrum by a spotless white Arab of elegant proportions.The trappings of Dhulldhull are all of solid gold, and a
      golden bow and quiver of arrows are fixed on the saddle.These extracts from a history of Lucknow before the Mutiny will enable
my readers to form some idea of the splendour of the Mohurrum of 1857,
and the value of the _tazia_ and paraphernalia found, as I said, by a
company of the Ninety-Third.I learned from native troopers that the
golden _tazia_ belonging to the crown jewels of Lucknow having
accompanied the king to Calcutta, a new one was made, for which the
Mahommedan population of Lucknow subscribed _lakhs_ of rupees.In the
eleventh chapter of his _Defence of the Residency_, Mr.L. E. R. Rees
states that the Mohurrum was celebrated with unusual splendour and
fanaticism, commencing that year on the 25th of August, and that on the
_kutal-ka-rath_, or night of slaughter, a certain Mr.Jones, with ten
other Christians, deserted to the enemy by undoing a barricaded door
when one of their own number was on sentry over it.But, instead of a
favourable reception as they anticipated, the deserters received the
fitting reward of their treachery from the insurgents; for they were all
immediately killed as a sacrifice, and their blood sprinkled on the
different _tazias_ throughout the city.To return to my own story; I was
told by a native jeweller, who was in Lucknow in 1857, that the crescent
and star alone of the new _tazia_ made for the young king, Brijis
Kuddur, cost five _lakhs_ of rupees.Be that as it may, it fell to a
company of the Ninety-Third to assault the Doorgah, where all this
consecrated paraphernalia was stored, and there they found this golden
_tazia_, with all the gold-embroidered standards, saddle, and
saddle-cloth, the gold quiver and arrows of Dhulldhull.There was at the
time I write, a certain lieutenant in the company whom I shall call
Jamie Blank.He was known to be very poor, and it was reported in the
regiment that he used to regularly remit half of his lieutenant's pay to
support a widowed mother and a sister, and this fact made the men of the
company consider Jamie Blank entitled to a share in the loot.So when
the _tazia_ was discovered, not being very sure whether the diamonds in
the crescent and star on the dome were real or imitation, they settled
to cut off the whole dome, and give it to Jamie; which they did.I don't
know where Jamie Blank disposed of this particular piece of loot, but I
was informed that it eventually found its way to London, and was sold
for L80,000.The best part of the story is, however, to come.There was
a certain newspaper correspondent in the camp (not Mr.Russell), who
depended on his native servant to translate Hindoostanee names into
English.When he heard that a company of the Ninety-Third had found a
gold _tazia_ of great value, and that they had presented the senior
lieutenant with the lid of it to enable him to deposit money to purchase
his captaincy, the correspondent asked his Madrassi servant the English
equivalent for _tazia_.Samuel, perhaps not knowing the English word
_tomb_, but knowing that the _tazia_ referred to a funeral, told his
master that the English for _tazia_ was _coffin_; so it went the round
of the English papers that among the plunder of Lucknow a certain
company of the Ninety-Third had found a gold coffin, and that they had
generously presented the senior lieutenant with the lid of it, which was
studded with diamonds and other precious stones.So far as I am aware,
this is the first time that the true explanation of Jamie Blank's golden
coffin-lid has been given to the world.As already mentioned, with the exception of the company which captured
the golden _tazia_ and the Mohurrum paraphernalia, the Ninety-Third got
very little loot; and by the time we returned to the city order was in
some measure restored, prize-agents appointed, and guards placed at the
different thoroughfares to intercept camp-followers and other plunderers
on their way back to camp, who were thus made to disgorge their
plunder, nominally for the public good or the benefit of the army.But
it was shrewdly suspected by the troops that certain small caskets in
battered cases, which contained the redemption of mortgaged estates in
Scotland, England, and Ireland, and snug fishing and shooting-boxes in
every game-haunted and salmon-frequented angle of the world, found their
way inside the uniform-cases of even the prize-agents.I could myself
name one deeply-encumbered estate which was cleared of mortgage to the
tune of L180,000 within two years of the plunder of Lucknow.I only wish I had to go through a similar campaign with the
experience I have now.But that is all very fine thirty-five years
after!"There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the
flood"--my readers know the rest.I missed the flood, and the tide is
not likely to turn my way again.Before we left Lucknow the plunder
accumulated by the prize-agents was estimated at over L600,000
(according to _The Times_ of 31st of May, 1858), and within a week it
had reached a million and a quarter sterling.Each private soldier who served throughout the relief and capture of
Lucknow got prize-money to the value of Rs.17.8; but the thirty _lakhs_
of treasure which were found in the well at Bithoor, leaving the plunder
of the Nana Sahib's palace out of the calculation, much more than
covered that amount.Yet I could myself name over a dozen men who served
throughout every engagement, two of whom gained the Victoria Cross, who
have died in the almshouse of their native parishes, and several in the
almshouse of the Calcutta District Charitable Society!But enough of
moralising; I must get back to 1858.Many camp-followers and others managed to evade the guards, and
cavalry-patrols were put on duty along the different routes on both
banks of the Goomtee and in the wider thoroughfares of Lucknow.In my last chapter I gave it as my opinion that the provost-marshal's
cat is the only general which can put a stop to plundering and restore
order in times like those I describe, or rather I should say, _which I
cannot_ describe, because it is impossible to find words to depict the
scenes which met one's eyes at every turn in the streets of Lucknow.In
and around Huzrutgunge, the Imambara, and Kaiserbagh mad riot and chaos
reigned,--sights fit only for the Inferno.I had heard the phrase "drunk
with plunder"; I then saw it illustrated in real earnest.Soldiers mad
with pillage and wild with excitement, followed by crowds of
camp-followers too cowardly to go to the front, but as ravenous as the
vultures which followed the army and preyed on the carcases of the
slain.I have already said that many of the enemy had to be dislodged
from close rooms by throwing in bags of gunpowder with slow matches
fixed to them."When these exploded they set fire to clothing,
cotton-padded quilts, and other furniture in the rooms; and the
consequence was that in the inner apartments of the palaces there were
hundreds of dead bodies half burnt; many wounded were burnt alive with
the dead, and the stench from such rooms was horrible!Historians tell
us that Charles the Ninth of France asserted that the smell of a dead
enemy was always sweet.If he had experienced the streets of Lucknow in
March, 1858, he might have had cause to modify his opinion."FOOTNOTES:

AN UNGRATEFUL DUTY--CAPTAIN BURROUGHS--THE DILKOOSHA AGAIN--GENERAL
WALPOLE AT ROOYAH--THE RAMGUNGA.After the Mutiny some meddling philanthropists in England tried to get
up an agitation about such stories as wounded sepoys being burnt alive;
but owing to the nature of the war it was morally impossible to have
prevented such accidents.As to cases of real wanton cruelty or outrage
committed by European soldiers, none came under my own notice, and I may
be permitted to relate here a story which goes far to disprove any
accusations of the sort.My company had been posted in a large building and garden near the Mint.Shortly after our arrival an order came for a non-commissioned officer
and a guard of selected men to take charge of a house with a harem, or
_zenana_, of about eighty women who had been rescued from different
harems about the Kaiserbagh,--begums of rank and of no rank, dancing
girls and household female slaves, some young and others of very
doubtful age.MacBean, our adjutant, selected me for the duty, first
because he said he knew I would not get drunk and thus overlook my
sense of responsibility; and, secondly, because by that time I had
picked up a considerable knowledge of colloquial Hindoostanee, and was
thus able to understand natives who could not speak English, and to make
myself understood by them.I got about a dozen old soldiers with me,
several of whom had been named for the duty by Sir Colin Campbell
himself, mostly married men of about twenty years' service.Owing to the
vicissitudes of my chequered life I have lost my pocket roll-book, and
do not now recollect the whole of the names of the men who formed this
guard.However, John Ellis, whose wife had acted as laundress for Sir
Colin in the Crimea, was one of them, and James Strachan, who was
nicknamed "the Bishop," was another; John M'Donald, the fourth of the
name in my company, was a third; I cannot now name more of them.If any
of that guard are alive now, they must be from threescore and ten to
fourscore years of age, because they were then all old men, tried and
true, and, as our adjutant said, Sir Colin had told him that no other
corps except the Ninety-Third could be trusted to supply a guard for
such a duty.MacBean, along with a staff or civil officer, accompanied
the guard to the house, and was very particular in impressing on my
attention the fact that the guard was on no pretence whatever to attempt
to hold any communication with the begums, except through a shrivelled,
parchment-faced, wicked-looking old woman (as I supposed), who, the
staff-officer told me, could speak English, and who had been directed
to report any shortcomings of the guard, should we not behave ourselves
circumspectly.But I must say I had little to fear on that head, for I
knew every one of my men could be trusted to be proof against the
temptation of begums, gold, or grog, and as for myself, I was then a
young non-commissioned officer with a very keen sense of my
responsibility.Shortly after we were installed in our position of trust, and the
officers had left us, we discovered several pairs of bright eyes peeping
out at us through the partly shattered venetians forming the doors and
windows of the house; and the person whom I had taken for a shrivelled
old woman came out and entered into conversation with me, at first in
Hindoostanee, but afterwards in very good and grammatical English.I
then discovered that what I had mistaken for a crack-voiced old woman, a
second edition of "the mother of the maids," was no other than a
confidential eunuch of the palace, who told me he had been over thirty
years about the court of Lucknow, employed as a sort of private
secretary under successive kings, as he was able to read and write
English, and could translate the English newspapers, etc., and could
also, judging from his villainous appearance, be trusted to strangle a
refractory begum or cut the throat of any one prying too closely into
court secrets.He was almost European in complexion, and appeared to me
to be more than seventy years of age, but he may have been much younger.He also told me that most of his early life had been spent at the court
of Constantinople, and that he had there learned English, and had found
this of great use to him at the court of Lucknow, where he had not only
kept up the knowledge, but had improved it by reading.By this time one of the younger begums, or nautch girls (I don't know
which), came out to see the guard, and did not appear by any means too
bashful.She evidently wished for a closer acquaintance, and I asked my
friend to request her to go back to her companions; but this she
declined to do, and wanted particularly to know why we were dressed in
petticoats, and if we were not part of the Queen of England's regiment
of eunuchs, and chaffed me a good deal about my fair hair and youthful
appearance.I was twenty-four hours on that guard before the begums were
removed by Major Bruce to a house somewhere near the Martiniere, and
during that twenty-four hours I learned more, through the assistance of
the English-speaking eunuch, about the virtues of polygamy and the
domestic slavery, intrigues, and crimes of the harem than I have learned
in all my other thirty-five years in India.If I dared, I could write a
few pages that would give the Government of India and the public of
England ten times more light on those cherished institutions than they
now possess.The authorities professed to take charge of those caged
begums for their own safety, but I don't think many of them were
over-thankful for the protection.Major Bruce, with an escort, removed
the ladies the next day, and I took leave of my communicative friend and
the begums without reluctance, and rejoined my company, glad to be rid
of such a dangerous charge.Except the company which stormed the Doorgah, the rest of the
Ninety-Third were employed more as guards on our return to the city; but
about the 23rd of the month Captain Burroughs and his company were
detailed, with some of Brazier's Sikhs, to drive a lot of rebels from
some mosques and large buildings which were the last positions held by
the enemy.If I remember rightly, Burroughs was then fourth on the list
of captains, and he got command of the regiment five years after,
through deaths by cholera, in Peshawar in 1862.The Ninety-Third had
three commanding officers in one day!Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald and
Major Middleton both died within a few hours of each other, and
Burroughs at once became senior major and succeeded to the command, the
senior colonel, Sir H. Stisted, being in command of a brigade in Bengal.Burroughs was born in India and was sent to France early for his
education, at least for the military part of it, and was a cadet of the
_Ecole Polytechnique_ of Paris.This accounted for his excellent
swordsmanship, his thorough knowledge of French, and his foreign accent.Burroughs was an accomplished _maitre d'armes_.When he joined the
Ninety-Third as an ensign in 1850 he was known as "Wee Frenchie."I
don't exactly remember his height, I think it was under five feet; but
what he wanted in size he made up in pluck and endurance.He served
throughout the Crimean war, and was never a day absent.It was he who
volunteered to lead the forlorn hope when it was thought the Highland
Brigade were to storm the Redan, before it was known that the Russians
had evacuated the position.At the relief of Lucknow he was not the
first man through the hole in the Secundrabagh; that was Lance-Corporal
Dunley of Burroughs' company; Sergeant-Major Murray was the second, and
was killed inside; the third was a Sikh _sirdar_, Gokul Sing, of the
Fourth Punjab Infantry, and Burroughs was either the fourth or fifth.He
was certainly the first _officer_ of the regiment inside, and was
immediately attacked by an Oude Irregular _sowar_ armed with _tulwar_
and shield, who nearly slashed Burroughs' right ear off before he got
properly on his feet.It was the wire frame of his feather bonnet that
saved him; the _sowar_ got a straight cut at his head, but the sword
glanced off the feather bonnet and nearly cut off his right ear.However, Burroughs soon gathered himself together (there was so little
of him!)and showed his tall opponent that he had for once met his match
in the art of fencing; before many seconds Burroughs' sword had passed
through his opponent's throat and out at the back of his neck.Notwithstanding his severe wound, Burroughs fought throughout the
capture of the Secundrabagh, with his right ear nearly severed from his
head, and the blood running down over his shoulder to his gaiters; nor
did he go to have his wound dressed till after he had mustered his
company, and reported to the colonel how many of No.Although his men disliked many of his ways, they were proud of
their little captain for his pluck and good heart.I will relate two
instances of this:--When promoted, Captain Burroughs had the misfortune
to succeed the most popular officer in the regiment in the command of
his company, namely, Captain Ewart (now Lieutenant-General Sir John
Alexander Ewart, K.C.B., etc.), and, among other innovations, Burroughs
tried to introduce certain _Polytechnique_ ideas new to the
Ninety-Third.At the first morning parade after assuming command of the
company, he wished to satisfy himself that the ears of the men were
clean inside, but being so short, he could not, even on tiptoe, raise
himself high enough to see; he therefore made them come to the kneeling
position, and went along the front rank from left to right, minutely
inspecting the inside of every man's ears!The Ninety-Third were all
tall men in those days, none being under five feet six inches even in
the centre of the rear rank of the battalion companies; and the right
hand man of Burroughs' company was a stalwart Highlander named Donald
MacLean, who could scarcely speak English and stood about six feet three
inches.When Burroughs examined Donald's ears he considered them dirty,
and told the colour-sergeant to put Donald down for three days' extra
drill.Donald, hearing this, at once sprang to his feet from the
kneeling position and, looking down on the little captain with a look of
withering scorn, deliberately said, "She will take three days' drill
from a man, but not from a monkey!"Of course Donald was at once marched
to the rear-guard a prisoner, and a charge lodged against him for
"insubordination and insolence to Captain Burroughs at the time of
inspection on morning parade."When the prisoner was brought before the
colonel he read over the charge, and, turning to Captain Burroughs,
said: "This is a most serious charge, Captain Burroughs, and against an
old soldier like Donald MacLean who has never been brought up for
punishment before.Burroughs was ashamed to state
the exact words, but beat about the bush, saying that he had ordered
MacLean three days' drill, and that he refused to submit to the
sentence, making use of most insolent and insubordinate language; but
the colonel could not get him to state the exact words used, and the
colour-sergeant was called as second witness.The colour-sergeant gave a
plain, straightforward account of the ear-inspection; and when he stated
how MacLean had sprung to his feet on hearing the sentence of three
days' drill, and had told the captain, "She will take three days' drill
from a man, but not from a monkey," the whole of the officers present
burst into fits of laughter, and even the colonel had to hold his hand
to his mouth.As soon as he could speak he turned on MacLean, and told
him that he deserved to be tried by a court-martial and so forth, but
ended by sentencing him to "three days' grog stopped."The orderly-room
hut was then cleared of all except the colonel, Captain Burroughs, and
the adjutant, and no one ever knew exactly what passed; but there was no
repetition of the kneeling position for ear-inspection on morning
parade.I have already said that Burroughs had a most kindly heart, and
for the next three days after this incident, when the grog bugle
sounded, Donald MacLean was as regularly called to the captain's tent,
and always returned smacking his lips, and emphatically stating that
"The captain was a Highland gentleman after all, and not a French
monkey."From that day forward, the little captain and the tall
grenadier became the best of friends, and years after, on the evening of
the 11th of March, 1858, when the killed and wounded were collected
after the capture of the Begum's Kothee in Lucknow, I saw Captain
Burroughs crying like a tender-hearted woman by the side of a _dooly_ in
which was stretched the dead body of Donald MacLean, who, it was said,
received his death-wound defending his captain.I have the authority of
the late colour-sergeant of No.6 company for the statement that from
the date of the death of MacLean, Captain Burroughs regularly remitted
thirty shillings a month, through the minister of her parish, to
Donald's widowed mother, till the day of her death seven years after.When an action of this kind became generally known in the regiment, it
caused many to look with kindly feelings on most of the peculiarities of
Burroughs.The other anecdote goes back to Camp Kamara and the spring of 1856, when
the Highland Brigade were lying there half-way between Balaclava and
Sebastopol.As before noticed, Burroughs was more like a Frenchman than
a Highlander; there were many of his old _Polytechnique_ chums in the
French army in the Crimea, and almost every day he had some visitors
from the French camp, especially after the armistice was proclaimed.Some time in the spring of 1856 Burroughs had picked up a Tartar pony
and had got a saddle, etc., for it, but he could get no regular groom.Not being a field-officer he was not entitled to a regulation groom, and
not being well liked, none of his company would volunteer for the
billet, especially as it formed no excuse for getting off other duties.One of the company had accordingly to be detailed on fatigue duty every
day to groom the captain's pony.On a particular day this duty had
fallen to a young recruit who had lately joined by draft, a man named
Patrick Doolan, a real Paddy of the true Handy Andy type, who had made
his way somehow to Glasgow and had there enlisted into the Ninety-Third.This day, as usual, Burroughs had visitors from the French camp, and it
was proposed that all should go for a ride, so Patrick Doolan was called
to saddle the captain's pony.Doolan had never saddled a pony in his
life before, and he put the saddle on with the pommel to the tail and
the crupper to the front, and brought the pony thus accoutred to the
captain's hut.Every one commenced to laugh, and Burroughs, getting into
a white heat, turned on Patrick, saying, "You fool, you have put the
saddle on with the back to the front!"Patrick at once saluted, and,
without the least hesitation, replied, "Shure, sir, you never told me
whether you were to ride to Balaclava or the front."Burroughs was so
tickled with the ready wit of the reply that from that day he took
Doolan into his service as soldier-servant, taught him his work, and
retained him till March, 1858, when Burroughs had to go on sick leave
on account of wounds.Burroughs was one of the last men wounded in the
taking of Lucknow.Some days after the Begum's Kothee was stormed, he
and his company were sent to drive a lot of rebels out of a house near
the Kaiserbagh, and, as usual, Burroughs was well in advance of his men.Just as they were entering the place the enemy fired a mine, and the
captain was sent about a hundred feet in the air; but being like a cat
(in the matter of being difficult to kill, I mean), he fell on his feet
on the roof of a thatched hut, and escaped, with his life indeed, but
with one of his legs broken in two places below the knee.It was only
the skill of our good doctor Munro that saved his leg; but he was sent
to England on sick leave, and before he returned I had left the regiment
and joined the Commissariat Department.This ends my reminiscences of
Captain Burroughs.May he long enjoy the rank he has attained in the
peace of his island home in Orkney!Notwithstanding his peculiarities,
he was a brave and plucky soldier and a most kind-hearted gentleman.By the end of March the Ninety-Third returned to camp at the Dilkoosha,
glad to get out of the city, where we were suffocated by the stench of
rotting corpses, and almost devoured with flies by day and mosquitoes by
night.The weather was now very hot and altogether uncomfortable, more
especially since we were without any means of bathing and could obtain
no regular changes of clothing.By this time numbers of the townspeople had returned to the city and
were putting their houses in order, while thousands of _coolies_ and
low-caste natives were employed clearing dead bodies out of houses and
hidden corners, and generally cleaning up the city.When we repassed the scene of our hard-contested struggle, the Begum's
palace,--which, I may here remark, was actually a much stronger position
than the famous Redan at Sebastopol,--we found the inner ditch, that had
given us so much trouble to get across, converted into a vast grave, in
which the dead had been collected in thousands and then covered by the
earth which the enemy had piled up as ramparts.All round Lucknow for
miles the country was covered with dead carcases of every kind,--human
beings, horses, camels, bullocks, and donkeys,--and for miles the
atmosphere was tainted and the swarms of flies were horrible, a positive
torment and a nuisance.The only comfort was that they roosted at night;
but at meal-times they were indescribable, and it was impossible to keep
them out of our food; our plates of rice would be perfectly black with
flies, and it was surprising how we kept such good health, for we had
little or no sickness during the siege of Lucknow.During the few days we remained in camp at the Dilkoosha the army was
broken up into movable columns, to take the field after the different
parties of rebels and to restore order throughout Oude; for although
Lucknow had fallen, the rebellion was not by any means over; the whole
of Oude was still against us, and had to be reconquered.The
Forty-Second, Seventy-Ninth, and Ninety-Third (the regiments which
composed the famous old Highland Brigade of the Crimea) were once more
formed into one brigade, and with a regiment of Punjab Infantry and a
strong force of engineers, the Ninth Lancers, a regiment of native
cavalry, a strong force of artillery, both light and heavy,--in brief,
as fine a little army as ever took the field, under the command of
General Walpole, with Adrian Hope as brigadier,--was detailed for the
advance into Rohilcund for the recapture of Bareilly, where a large army
still held together under Khan Bahadoor Khan.Every one in the camp
expressed surprise that Sir Colin should entrust his favourite
Highlanders to Walpole.On the morning of the 7th of April, 1858, the time had at last arrived
when we were to leave Lucknow, and the change was hailed by us with
delight.We were glad to get away from the captured city, with its
horrible smells and still more horrible sights, and looked forward with
positive pleasure to a hot-weather campaign in Rohilcund.We were to
advance on Bareilly by a route parallel with the course of the Ganges,
so striking our tents at 2 A.M.we marched through the city
along the right bank of the Goomtee, past the Moosabagh, where our first
halt was made, about five miles out of Lucknow, in the midst of fresh
fields, away from all the offensive odours and the myriads of flies.One
instance will suffice to give my readers some idea of the torment we
suffered from these pests.When we struck tents all the flies were
roosting in the roofs; when the tents were rolled up the flies got
crushed and killed by bushels, and no one who has not seen such a sight
would credit the state of the inside of our tents when opened out to be
repitched on the new ground.After the tents were pitched and the roofs
swept down, the sweepers of each company were called to collect the dead
flies and carry them out of the camp.I noted down the quantity of flies
carried out of my own tent.The ordinary kitchen-baskets served out to
the regimental cooks by the commissariat for carrying bread, rice, etc.,
will hold about an imperial bushel, and from one tent there were carried
out five basketfuls of dead flies.The sight gave one a practical idea
of one of the ten plagues of Egypt!Being now rid of the flies we could
lie down during the heat of the day, and have a sleep without being
tormented.The defeated army of Lucknow had flocked into Rohilcund, and a large
force was reported to be collected in Bareilly under Khan Bahadoor Khan
and Prince Feroze Shah.The following is a copy of one of Khan Bahadoor
Khan's proclamations for the harassment of our advance: "Do not attempt
to meet the regular columns of the infidels, because they are superior
to you in discipline and have more guns; but watch their movements;
guard all the _ghats_ on the rivers, intercept their communications;
stop their supplies; cut up their piquets and _daks_; keep constantly
hanging about their camps; give them no rest!"These were, no doubt,
the correct tactics; it was the old Mahratta policy revived.However,
nothing came of it, and our advance was unopposed till we reached the
jungle fort of Nirput Singh, the Rajpoot chief of Rooyah, near the
village of Rhodamow.I was in the
advance-guard under command of a young officer who had just come out
from home as a cadet in the H.E.I.Company's service, and there being no
Company's regiments for him, he was attached to the Ninety-Third before
we left Lucknow.His name was Wace, a tall young lad of, I suppose,
sixteen or seventeen years of age.I don't remember him before that
morning, but he was most anxious for a fight, and I recollect that
before we marched off our camping-ground, Brigadier Hope called up young
Mr.Wace, and gave him instructions about moving along with great
caution with about a dozen picked men for the leading section of the
advance-guard.We advanced without opposition till sunrise, and then we came in sight
of an outpost of the enemy about three miles from the fort; but as soon
as they saw us they retired, and word was passed back to the column.Shortly afterwards instructions came for the advance-guard to wait for
the main column, and I remember young Mr.Wace going up to the
brigadier, and asking to be permitted to lead the assault on the fort,
should it come to a fight.At this time a summons to surrender had been
sent to the Raja, but he vouchsafed no reply, and, as we advanced, a
9-pounder shot was fired at the head of the column, killing a drummer
of the Forty-Second.The attack on the fort then commenced, without any
attempt being made to reconnoitre the position, and ended in a most
severe loss, Brigadier Hope being among the killed.Lieutenant
Willoughby, who commanded the Sikhs,--a brother of the officer who blew
up the powder-magazine at Delhi, rather than let it fall into the hands
of the enemy,--was also killed; as were Lieutenants Douglas and Bramley
of the Forty-Second, with nearly one hundred men, Highlanders and Sikhs.Hope was shot from a high tree inside the fort, and, at the time, it was
believed that the man who shot him was a European.[43] After we retired
from the fort the excitement was so great among the men of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, owing to the sacrifice of so many
officers and men through sheer mismanagement, that if the officers had
given the men the least encouragement, I am convinced they would have
turned out in a body and hanged General Walpole.The officers who were
killed were all most popular men; but the great loss sustained by the
death of Adrian Hope positively excited the men to fury.So heated was
the feeling on the night the dead were buried, that if any
non-commissioned officer had dared to take the lead, the life of General
Walpole would not have been worth half an hour's purchase.After the force retired,--for we actually retired!--from Rooyah on the
evening of the 15th of April, we encamped about two miles from the
place, and a number of our dead were left in the ditch, mostly
Forty-Second and Sikhs; and, so far as I am aware, no attempt was made
to invest the fort or to keep the enemy in.They took advantage of this
to retreat during the night; but this they did leisurely, burning their
own dead, and stripping and mutilating those of our force that were
abandoned in the ditch.It was reported in the camp that Colonel Haggard
of the Ninth Lancers, commanding the cavalry brigade, had proposed to
invest the place, but was not allowed to do so by General Walpole, who
was said to have acted in such a pig-headed manner that the officers
considered him insane.Rumour added that when Colonel Haggard and a
squadron of the Lancers went to reconnoitre the place on the morning of
the 16th, it was found empty; and that when Colonel Haggard sent an
aide-de-camp to report this fact to the general, he had replied, "Thank
God!"appearing glad that Raja Nirput Singh and his force had slipped
through his fingers after beating back the best-equipped movable column
in India.These reports gaining currency in the camp made the general
still more unpopular, because, in addition to his incapability as an
officer, the men put him down as a coward.During the day the mutilated bodies of our men were recovered from the
ditch.The Sikhs burnt theirs, while a large fatigue party of the
Forty-Second and Ninety-Third was employed digging one long grave in a
_tope_ of trees not far from the camp.About four o'clock in the
afternoon the funeral took place, Brigadier Hope and the officers on
the right, wrapped in their tartan plaids, the non-commissioned officers
and the privates on their left, each sewn up in a blanket.Cowie, whom we of the Ninety-Third had nicknamed "the Fighting Padre,"
afterwards Bishop of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Rev.Ross,
chaplain of the Forty-Second, conducted the service, Mr.Ross reading
the ninetieth Psalm and Mr.The pipers of
the Forty-Second and Ninety-Third, with muffled drums, played _The
Flowers of the Forest_ as a dead march.In all my experience in the army
or out of it I never witnessed such intense grief, both among officers
and men, as was expressed at this funeral.Many of all ranks sobbed like
tender-hearted women.I especially remember our surgeon, "kind-hearted
Billy Munro" as the men called him; also Lieutenants Archie Butter and
Dick Cunningham, who were aides-de-camp to Adrian Hope.Cunningham had
rejoined the regiment after recovery from his wounds at Kudjwa in
October, 1857, but they had left him too lame to march, and he was a
supernumerary aide-de-camp to Brigadier Hope; he and Butter were both
alongside the brigadier, I believe, when he was struck down by the
renegade ruffian.We halted during the 17th, and strong fatigue-parties were employed with
the engineers destroying the fort by blowing up the gateways.The place
was ever after known in the Ninety-Third as "Walpole's Castle."On the
18th we marched, and on the 22nd we came upon the retreating rebels at
a place called Sirsa, on the Ramgunga.The Ninth Lancers and
Horse-Artillery and two companies of the Ninety-Third (I forget their
numbers) crossed the Ramgunga by a ford and intercepted the retreat of a
large number of the enemy, who were escaping by a bridge of boats, the
material for which the country people had collected for them.But their
retreat was now completely cut off, and about three hundred of them were
reported either killed or drowned in the Ramgunga.a tremendous sandstorm, with thunder, and rain in
torrents, came on.The Ramgunga became so swollen that it was impossible
for the detachment of the Ninety-Third to recross, and they bivouacked
in a deserted village on the opposite side, without tents, the officers
hailing across that they could make themselves very comfortable for the
night if they could only get some tea and sugar, as the men had
biscuits, and they had secured a quantity of flour and some goats in the
village.But the boats which the enemy had collected had all broken
adrift, and there was apparently no possibility of sending anything
across to our comrades.This dilemma evoked an act of real cool pluck on
the part of our commissariat _gomashta_,[44] _baboo_ Hera Lall
Chatterjee, whom I have before mentioned in my seventh chapter in
reference to the plunder of a cartload of biscuits at Bunnee bridge on
the retreat from Lucknow.By this time Hera Lall had become better
acquainted with the "wild Highlanders," and was even ready to risk his
life to carry a ration of tea and sugar to them.This he made into a
bundle, which he tied on the crown of his head, and although several of
the officers tried to dissuade him from the attempt, he tightened his
_chudder_[45] round his waist, and declaring that he had often swum the
Hooghly, and that the Ramgunga should not deprive the officers and men
of a detachment of his regiment of their tea, he plunged into the river,
and safely reached the other side with his precious freight on his head!This little incident was never forgotten in the regiment so long as Hera
Lall remained the commissariat _gomashta_ of the Ninety-Third.He was
then a young man, certainly not more than twenty.Although thirty-five
more years of rough-and-tumble life have now considerably grizzled his
appearance, he must often look back with pride to that stormy April
evening in 1858, when he risked his life in the Ramgunga to carry a
tin-pot of tea to the British soldiers.Among the enemy killed that day were several wearing the uniforms
stripped from the dead of the Forty-Second in the ditch of Rooyah; so,
of course, we concluded that this was Nirput Singh's force, and the
defeat and capture of its guns in some measure, I have no doubt,
re-established General Walpole in the good opinion of the authorities,
but not much in that of the force under his command.Nothing else of consequence occurred till about the 27th of April, when
our force rejoined the Commander-in-Chief's column, which had advanced
_via_ Futtehghur, and we heard that Sir William Peel had died of
smallpox at Cawnpore on his way to Calcutta.The news went through the
camp from regiment to regiment, and caused almost as much sorrow in the
Ninety-Third as the death of poor Adrian Hope.FOOTNOTES:

BATTLE OF BAREILLY--GHAZIS--A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--HALT AT BAREILLY
--ACTIONS OF POSGAON, RUSSOOLPORE, AND NOWRUNGABAD--REST AT LAST!The heat was now very oppressive, and we had many men struck down by the
sun every day.We reached Shahjehanpore on the 30th of April, and found
that every building in the cantonments fit for sheltering European
troops had been destroyed by order of the Nana Sahib, who, however, did
not himself wait for our arrival.Strange to say, the bridge of boats
across the Ramgunga was not destroyed, and some of the buildings in the
jail, and the wall round it, were still standing.Colonel Hale and a
wing of the Eighty-Second were left here with some guns, to make the
best of their position in the jail, which partly dominated the city.The
Shahjehanpore distillery was mostly destroyed, but the native distillers
had been working it, and there was a large quantity of rum still in the
vats, which was found to be good and was consequently annexed by the
commissariat.On the 2nd of May we left Shahjehanpore _en route_ for Bareilly, and on
the next day reached Futtehgunge Every village was totally deserted,
but no plundering was allowed, and any camp-followers found marauding
were soon tied up by the provost-marshal's staff.Proclamations were
sent everywhere for the people to remain in their villages, but without
any effect.Two days later we reached Furreedpore, which we also found
deserted, but with evident signs that the enemy were near; and our
bazaars were full of reports of the great strength of the army of Khan
Bahadoor Khan and Feroze Shah.The usual estimate was thirty thousand
infantry, twenty-five thousand cavalry, and about three hundred guns,
among which was said to be a famous black battery that had beaten the
European artillery at ball-practice a few months before they mutinied at
Meerut.The left wing of the Ninety-Third was thrown out, with a
squadron of the Lancers and Tombs' battery, as the advance piquet.As
darkness set in we could see the fires of the enemy's outposts, their
patrol advancing quite close to our sentries during the night, but
making no attack.on the 5th of May, according to Sir Colin's usual
plan, three days' rations were served out, and the whole force was under
arms and slowly advancing before daylight.By sunrise we could see the
enemy drawn up on the plain some five miles from Bareilly, in front of
what had been the native lines; but as we advanced, they retired.By
noon we had crossed the nullah in front of the old cantonments, and,
except by sending round-shot among us at long distances, which did not
do much harm, the enemy did not dispute our advance.We were halted in
the middle of a bare, sandy plain, and we of the rank and file then got
to understand why the enemy were apparently in some confusion; we could
hear the guns of Brigadier Jones ("Jones the Avenger" as he was called)
hammering at them on the other side.The Ninety-Third formed the extreme
right of the front line of infantry with a squadron of the Lancers and
Tombs' battery of horse-artillery.The heat was intense, and when about
two o'clock a movement in the mango _topes_ in our front caused the
order to stand to our arms, it attained such a pitch that the barrels of
our rifles could not be touched by our bare hands!The Sikhs and our light company advanced in skirmishing order, when some
seven to eight hundred matchlock-men opened fire on them, and all at
once a most furious charge was made by a body of about three hundred and
sixty Rohilla Ghazis, who rushed out, shouting "_Bismillah!Deen!_" Sir Colin was close by, and called out, "Ghazis,
Ghazis!However, they
inclined to our left, and only a few came on to the Ninety-Third, and
these were mostly bayoneted by the light company which was extended in
front of the line.The main body rushed on the centre of the
Forty-Second; but as soon as he saw them change their direction Sir
Colin galloped on, shouting out, "Close up, Forty-Second!But that was not so easily done; the Ghazis charged in
blind fury, with their round shields on their left arms, their bodies
bent low, waving their _tulwars_ over their heads, throwing themselves
under the bayonets, and cutting at the men's legs.Colonel Cameron, of
the Forty-Second, was pulled from his horse by a Ghazi, who leaped up
and seized him by the collar while he was engaged with another on the
opposite side; but his life was saved by Colour-Sergeant Gardener, who
seized one of the enemy's _tulwars_, and rushing to the colonel's
assistance cut off the Ghazi's head.General Walpole was also pulled off
his horse and received two sword-cuts, but was rescued by the bayonets
of the Forty-Second.The struggle was short, but every one of the Ghazis
was killed.None attempted to escape; they had evidently come on to kill
or be killed, and a hundred and thirty-three lay in one circle right in
front of the colours of the Forty-Second.The Commander-in-Chief himself saw one of the Ghazis, who had broken
through the line, lying down, shamming dead.Sir Colin caught the glance
of his eye, saw through the ruse, and called to one of the Forty-Second,
"Bayonet that man!"But the Ghazi was enveloped in a thick quilted tunic
of green silk, through which the blunt Enfield bayonet would not pass,
and the Highlander was in danger of being cut down, when a Sikh
_sirdar_[46] of the Fourth Punjabis rushed to his assistance, and took
the Ghazi's head clean off with one sweep of his keen _tulwar_.These
Ghazis, with a very few exceptions, were gray-bearded men of the Rohilla
race, clad in green, with green turbans and _kummerbunds_,[47] round
shields on the left arm, and curved _tulwars_ that would split a hair.They only succeeded in wounding about twenty men--they threw themselves
so wildly on the bayonets of the Forty-Second!One of them, an exception
to the majority, was quite a youth, and having got separated from the
rest challenged the whole of the line to come out and fight him.Joiner, the quartermaster of the Ninety-Third, firing his
carbine, but missing.Joiner returned the fire with his revolver,
and the Ghazi then threw away his carbine and rushed at Joiner with his
_tulwar_.Some of the light company tried to take the youngster
prisoner, but it was no use; he cut at every one so madly, that they had
to bayonet him.The commotion caused by this attack was barely over, when word was
passed that the enemy were concentrating in front for another rush, and
the order was given for the spare ammunition to be brought to the front.I was detached with about a dozen men of No.7 company to find the
ammunition-guard, and bring our ammunition in rear of the line.Just as
I reached the ammunition-camels, a large force of the rebel cavalry, led
by Feroze Shah in person, swept round the flank and among the baggage,
cutting down camels, camel-drivers, and camp-followers in all
directions.My detachment united with the ammunition-guard and defended
ourselves, shooting down a number of the enemy's _sowars_.Ross, chaplain of the Forty-Second, running for his life,
dodging round camels and bullocks with a rebel _sowar_ after him, till,
seeing our detachment, he rushed to us for protection, calling out,
"Ninety-Third, shoot that impertinent fellow!"Bob Johnston, of my
company, shot the _sowar_ down.Ross had no sword nor revolver, and
not even a stick with which to defend himself.Moral--When in the field,
_padres_, carry a good revolver!Ross gained
our protection, we saw Mr.Russell, of _The Times_, who was ill and
unable to walk from the kick of a horse, trying to escape on horseback.He had got out of his _dooly_, undressed and bareheaded as he was, and
leaped into the saddle, as the _syce_ had been leading his horse near
him.Several of the enemy's _sowars_ were dodging through the camels to
get at him.We turned our rifles on them, and I shot down the one
nearest to Mr.Russell, just as he had cut down an intervening
camel-driver and was making for "Our Special"; in fact, his _tulwar_ was
actually lifted to swoop down on Mr.Russell's bare head when my bullet
put a stop to his proceedings.Russell tumble from his saddle
at the same instant as the _sowar_ fell, and I got a rare fright, for I
thought my bullet must have struck both.Russell had fallen, and I then saw from the position of the slain
_sowar_ that my bullet had found its proper billet, and that Mr.Russell
was down with sunstroke, the blood flowing freely from his nose.Our Mooltanee Irregulars were after the enemy, and
I had to hasten to the line with the spare ammunition; but before I left
Mr.Russell to his fate, I called some of the Forty-Second
baggage-guards to put him into his _dooly_ and take him to their doctor,
while I hastened back to the line and reported the occurrence to Captain
Dawson.Next morning I was glad to hear that Mr.Russell was still
alive, and likely to get over his stroke.After this charge of the rebel cavalry we were advanced; but the thunder
of Jones' attack on the other side of the city evidently disconcerted
the enemy, and they made off to the right of our line, while large
numbers of Ghazis concentrated themselves in the main buildings of the
city.We suffered more from the sun than from the enemy; and after we
advanced into the shelter of a large mango _tope_ we were nearly eaten
alive by swarms of small green insects, which invaded our bare legs in
thousands, till we were glad to leave the shelter of the mango trees and
take to the open plain again.As night drew on the cantonments were
secured, the baggage was collected, and we bivouacked on the plain,
strong piquets being thrown out.My company was posted in a small field
of onions near a _pucca_[48] well with a Persian wheel for lifting the
water.We supped off the biscuits in our haversacks, raw onions, and the
cool water drawn from well, and then went off to sleep.I wish I might
always sleep as soundly as I did that night after my supper of raw
onions and dry biscuits!On the 6th of May the troops were under arms, and advanced on the city
of Bareilly.But little opposition was offered, except from one large
house on the outskirts of the town, in which a body of about fifty
Rohilla Ghazis had barricaded themselves, and a company (I think it was
No.6 of the Ninety-Third) was sent to storm the house, after several
shells had been pitched into it.This was done without much loss, except
that of one man; I now forget his name, but think it was William
MacDonald.He rushed into a room full of Ghazis, who, before his
comrades could get to his assistance, had cut him into sixteen pieces
with their sharp _tulwars_!As the natives said, he was cut into
annas.[49] But the house was taken, and the whole of the Ghazis slain,
with only the loss of this one man killed and about half a dozen
wounded.While this house was being stormed the townspeople sent a deputation of
submission to the Commander-in-Chief, and by ten o'clock we had pitched
our camp near the ruins of the church which had been destroyed twelve
months before.Khan Bahadoor Khan and the Nana Sahib were reported to
have fled in the direction of the Nepal Terai, while Feroze Shah, with a
force of cavalry and guns, had gone back to attack Shahjehanpore.About mid-day on the 6th a frightful accident happened, by which a large
number of camp-followers and cattle belonging to the ordnance-park were
killed.Whether for concealment or by design (it was never known which)
the enemy had left a very large quantity of gunpowder and loaded shells
in a dry well under a huge tree in the centre of the old cantonment.The
well had been filled to the very mouth with powder and shells, and then
covered with a thin layer of dry sand.A large number of ordnance
_khalasies_,[50] bullock-drivers, and _dooly_-bearers had congregated
under the tree to cook their mid-day meal, lighting their fires right on
the top of this powder-magazine, when it suddenly exploded with a most
terrific report, shaking the ground for miles, making the tent-pegs fly
out of the hard earth, and throwing down tents more than a mile from the
spot.I was lying down in a tent at the time, and the concussion was so
great that I felt as if lifted clear off the ground.The tent-pegs flew
out all round, and down came the tents, before the men, many of whom
were asleep, had time to get clear of the canvas.By the time we got our
arms free of the tents, bugles were sounding the assembly in all
directions, and staff-officers galloping over the plain to ascertain
what had happened.The spot where the accident had occurred was easily
found.The powder having been in a deep well, it acted like a huge
mortar, fired perpendicularly; an immense cloud of black smoke was sent
up in a vertical column at least a thousand yards high, and thousands of
shells were bursting in it, the fragments flying all round in a circle
of several hundred yards.As the place was not far from the
ammunition-park, the first idea was that the enemy had succeeded in
blowing up the ammunition; but those who had ever witnessed a similar
accident could see that, whatever had happened, the concussion was too
great to be caused by only one or two waggon-loads of powder.From the
appearance of the column of smoke and the shells bursting in it, as if
shot out of a huge mortar, it was evident that the accident was confined
to one small spot, and the belief became general that the enemy had
exploded an enormous mine.But after some time the truth became known,
the troops were dispersed, and the tents repitched.This explosion was
followed in the afternoon by a most terrific thunderstorm and heavy
rain, which nearly washed away the camp.The storm came on as the
non-commissioned officers of the Ninety-Third and No.2 company were
falling in to bury Colour-Sergeant Mackie, who had been knocked down by
the sun the day before and had died that forenoon.Just when we were
lowering the body into the grave, there was a crash of thunder almost as
loud as the explosion of the powder-mine.The ground becoming soaked
with rain, the tent-pegs drew and many tents were again thrown down by
the force of the hurricane; and as everything we had became soaked, we
passed a most uncomfortable night.On the morning of the 7th of May we heard that Colonel Hale and the wing
of the Eighty-Second left in the jail at Shahjehanpore had been attacked
by Feroze Shah and the Nana Sahib, and were sore pushed to defend
themselves.A brigade, consisting of the Sixtieth Rifles, Seventy-Ninth
Highlanders, several native regiments, the Ninth Lancers, and some
batteries of artillery, under Brigadier John Jones ("the Avenger") was
at once started back for the relief of Shahjehanpore--rather a gloomy
outlook for the hot weather of 1858!While this brigade was starting,
the remainder of the force which was to hold Bareilly for the hot
season, consisting of the Forty-Second, Seventy-Eighth, and
Ninety-Third, shifted camp to the sandy plain near where Bareilly
railway station now stands, hard by the little fort in the centre of the
plain.There we remained in tents during the whole of May, large working
parties being formed every morning to assist the engineers to get what
shelter was possible ready for the hottest months.The district jail was
arranged as barracks for the Ninety-Third, and we moved into them on the
1st of June.The Forty-Second got the old _cutchery_[51] buildings with
a new thatch roof; and the Seventy-Eighth had the Bareilly College.I omitted to mention in its proper place that on the death of Adrian
Hope, Colonel A. S. Leith-Hay, of the Ninety-Third, succeeded to the
command of the brigade, and Major W. G. A. Middleton got command of the
regiment till we rejoined the Commander-in-Chief, when it was found that
Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, who had exchanged with Lieutenant-Colonel C.
Gordon, had arrived from England and taken command before we retook
Bareilly.We remained in Bareilly from May till October in comparative peace.We
had one or two false alarms, and a wing of the Forty-Second, with some
cavalry and artillery, went out about the beginning of June to disperse
a body of rebels who were threatening an attack on Moradabad.These reminiscences do not, as I have before remarked, profess to be a
history of the Mutiny except in so far as I saw it from the ranks of the
Ninety-Third.But I may correct historical mistakes when I find them,
and in vol.500, of _The Indian Empire_, by R. Montgomery
Martin, the following statement occurs: "Khan Bahadoor Khan, of
Bareilly, held out in the Terai until the close of 1859; and then,
hemmed in by the Goorkhas on one side and the British forces on the
other, was captured by Jung Bahadoor.The Khan is described as an old
man, with a long white beard, bent almost double with rheumatic fever.His life is considered forfeited by his alleged complicity in the
Bareilly murders, but his sentence is not yet pronounced."Khan Bahadoor Khan was captured by the Bareilly
police-levy early in July, 1858, and was hanged in my presence in front
of the _kotwalee_ in Bareilly a few days after his capture.He was an
old man with a long white beard, but not at all bent with age, and there
was certainly no want of proof of his complicity in the Bareilly
murders.Next to the Nana Sahib he was one of the most active
instigators of murder in the rebel ranks.He was a retired judge of the
Company's service, claiming descent from the ancient rulers of
Rohilcund, whom the English, in the time of Warren Hastings, had
assisted the Nawab of Lucknow to put down in the Rohilla war.His
capture was effected in the following manner:--Colonel W. C. M'Donald,
of the Ninety-Third, was on the staff in the Crimea, and he had in his
employ a man named Tahir Beg who was a sort of confidential interpreter.Whether this man was Turkish, Armenian, or Bulgarian I don't know, but
this much I do know; among Mahommedans Tahir Beg was a strict Mussulman,
among Bulgarians he was a Roman Catholic, and in the Ninety-Third he had
no objections to be a Presbyterian.He was a good linguist, speaking
English, French, and Turkish, as well as most of the vernaculars of Asia
Minor; and when the Crimean war was over, he accompanied Major M'Donald
to England in the capacity of an ordinary servant.In 1857, when the
expedition under Lord Elgin was being got ready for China, Colonel
M'Donald was appointed quarter-master-general, and started for Canton
taking Tahir Beg with him as a servant; but, the expedition to China
having been diverted for the suppression of the Mutiny, M'Donald
rejoined the regiment with Tahir Beg still with him in the same
capacity.From his knowledge of Turkish and Persian Tahir Beg soon made
himself master of Hindoostanee, and he lived in the regimental bazaar
with the Mahommedan shopkeepers, among whom he professed himself a
strict follower of the Prophet.After he became pretty well conversant
with the language, it was reported that he gained much valuable
information for the authorities.When Bareilly was recaptured
arrangements were made for the enlistment of a police-levy, and Tahir
Beg got the appointment of city _kotwal_[52] and did valuable service by
hunting out a great number of leading rebels.It was Tahir Beg who heard
that Khan Bahadoor Khan had returned to the vicinity of Bareilly with
only a small body of followers; and he arranged for his capture, and
brought him in a prisoner to the guard-room of the Ninety-Third.Khan
Bahadoor Khan was put through a brief form of trial by the civil power,
and was found guilty of rebellion and murder upon both native and
European evidence.By that time several Europeans who had managed to
escape to Naini Tal on the outbreak of the Mutiny through the favour of
the late Raja of Rampore, had returned; so there was no doubt of the
prisoner's guilt.I must mention another incident that happened in Bareilly.Among the
gentlemen who returned from Naini Tal, was one whose brother had been
shot by his bearer, his most trusted servant.This ruffian turned out to
be no other than the very man who had denounced Jamie Green as a spy.It
was either early in August or at the end of July that a strange European
gentleman, while passing through the regimental bazaar of the
Ninety-Third, noticed an officer's servant, who was a most devout
Christian, could speak English, and was a regular attendant at all
soldiers' evening services with the regimental chaplain.The gentleman
(I now forget his name) laid hold of our devout Christian brother in the
bazaar, and made him over to the nearest European guard, when he was
tried and found guilty of the murder of a whole family of
Europeans--husband, wife, and children--in May, 1857.There was no want
of evidence, both European and native, against him.Thus was the death
of the unfortunate Jamie Green avenged.I may add a rather amusing
incident about this man.His master evidently believed that this was a
case of mistaken identity, and went to see the brigadier, Colonel A. S.
Leith-Hay, on behalf of his servant.But it turned out that the man had
joined the British camp at Futtehghur in the preceding January, and
Colonel Leith-Hay was the first with whom he had taken service and
consequently knew the fellow.However, the brigadier listened to what
the accused's master had to urge until he mentioned that the man was a
most devout Christian, and read the Bible morning and evening.On this
Colonel Leith-Hay could listen to the argument no longer, but shouted
out:--"He a Christian!He's no more a
Christian than I am!He served me for one month, and robbed me of more
than ten times his pay.So he was made over to the
civil commissioner, tried, found guilty, and hanged.About the end of September the
weather was comparatively cool.Many people had returned from Naini Tal
to look after their wrecked property.General Colin Troup with the
Sixty-Sixth Regiment of Goorkhas had come down from Kumaon, and
soldiers' sports were got up for the amusement of the troops and
visitors.Among the latter was the loyal Raja of Rampore, who presented
a thousand rupees for prizes for the games and five thousand for a
dinner to all the troops in the garrison.At these games the
Ninety-Third carried off all the first prizes for putting the shot,
throwing the hammer, and tossing the caber.Our best athlete was a man
named George Bell, of the grenadier company, the most powerful man in
the British army.Before the regiment left England Bell had beaten all
comers at all the athletic games throughout Scotland.He stood about six
feet four inches, and was built in proportion, most remarkably active
for his size both in running and leaping, and also renowned for feats of
strength.There was a young lad of the band named Murdoch MacKay, the
smallest boy in the regiment, but a splendid dancer; and the two, "the
giant and the pigmy," as they were called, attended all the athletic
games throughout Scotland from Edinburgh to Inverness, always returning
covered with medals.I mention all this because the Bareilly sports
proved the last to poor George Bell.An enormous caber having been cut,
and all the leading men (among them some very powerful artillerymen) of
the brigade had tried to toss it and failed.The brigadier then ordered
three feet to be cut from it, expressing his opinion that there was not
a man in the British army who could toss it.On this George Bell stepped
into the arena, and said he would take a turn at it before it was cut;
he put the huge caber on his shoulders, balanced it, and tossed it clean
over.While the caber was being cut for the others, Bell ran in a
hundred yards' race, which he also won; but he came in with his mouth
full of blood.He had, through over-exertion, burst a blood-vessel in
his lungs.He slowly bled to death and died about a fortnight after we
left Bareilly, and lies buried under a large tree in the jungles of Oude
between Fort Mithowlie and the banks of the Gogra.Bell was considered
an ornament to, and the pride of, the regiment, and his death was
mourned by every officer and man in it, and by none more than by our
popular doctor, Billy Munro, who did everything that a physician could
do to try and stop the bleeding; but without success.We left Bareilly on the 10th of October, and marched to Shahjehanpore,
where we were joined by a battalion of the Sixtieth Rifles, the
Sixty-Sixth Goorkhas, some of the Sixth Carabineers, Tomb's troop of
horse-artillery, and a small train of heavy guns and mortars.On the
17th of October we had our first brush with the enemy at the village of
Posgaon, about twenty miles from Shahjehanpore.Here they were strong in
cavalry, and tried the Bareilly game of getting round the flanks and
cutting up our camp-followers.But a number of them got hemmed in
between the ammunition-guard and the main line, and Cureton's Mooltanee
cavalry, coming round on them from both flanks, cut down about fifty of
them, capturing their horses.In the midst of this scrimmage two of the
enemy, getting among the baggage-guard, were taken for two of our native
cavalry, till at length they separated from the main body and got
alongside of a man who was some distance away.One of them called to the
poor fellow to look in another direction, when the second one cut his
head clean off, leaped from his horse, and, lifting the head, sprang
into his saddle and was off like the wind!Many rifle-bullets were sent
after him, but he got clear away, carrying the head with him.The next encounter we had was at Russoolpore, and then at Nowrungabad,
where the Queen's proclamation, transferring the government from the
Company to the Crown, was read.After this all our tents were sent into
Mahomdee, and we took to the jungles without tents or baggage, merely a
greatcoat and a blanket; and thus we remained till after the taking of
Mithowlie.We then returned to Sitapore, where we got our tents again
the day before Christmas, 1858; and by the new year we were on the banks
of the Gogra, miles from any village.The river swarmed with alligators
of enormous size, and the jungles with wild pig and every variety of
game, and scarcely a day passed without our seeing tigers, wolves, and
hyaenas.We remained in those jungles
across the Gogra, in sight of the Nepaul hills, till about the end of
February, by which time thousands of the rebels had tendered their
submission and returned to their homes.The Ninety-Third then got the
route for Subathoo, in the Himalayas near Simla.Leaving the jungles of
Oude, we marched _via_ Shahjehanpore, Bareilly, Moradabad, and thence by
the foot of the hills till we came into civilised regions at
Saharunpore; thence to Umballa, reaching Subathoo about the middle of
April with our clothes completely in rags.We had received no new
clothing since we had arrived in India, and our kilts were torn into
ribbons.But the men were in splendid condition, and could have marched
thirty miles a day without feeling fatigued, if our baggage-animals
could have kept up with us.On our march out from Kalka, the
Commander-in-Chief passed us on his way to Simla.This ended the work of the old Ninety-Third Sutherland Highlanders in
the Mutiny, and here, for the present, I will end my reminiscences.FOOTNOTES:

THE HISTORY OF THE MURDER OF MAJOR NEILL AT AUGUR IN 1887


I will relate an incident of an unusual kind, told to me by a man whom I
met in Jhansi, which has reference to the executions ordered by General
Neill at Cawnpore in July and August, 1857.But before I do so I may
mention that in Cawnpore, Jhansi, and Lucknow I found the natives very
unwilling to enter into conversation or to give any information about
the events of that year.In this statement I don't include the natives
of the class who acted as guides, etc., or those who were in the service
of Government at the time._They_ were ready enough to talk; but as a
rule I knew as much myself as they could tell me.Those whom I found
suspicious of my motives and unwilling to talk, were men who must have
been on the side of the rebels against us.I looked out for such, and
met many who had evidently served as soldiers, and who admitted that
they had been in the army before 1857; but when I tried to get them to
speak about the Mutiny, as a rule they pretended to have been so young
that they had forgotten all about it,--generally a palpable falsehood,
judging from their personal appearance,--or they professed to have been
absent in their villages and to know nothing about the events happening
in the great centres of the rebellion.The impression left on my mind
was that they were either afraid or ashamed to talk about the Mutiny.In the second chapter of these reminiscences it may be remembered I
asked if any reader could let me know whether Major A. H. S. Neill,
commanding the Second Regiment Central India Horse, who was shot on
parade by Sowar Mazar Ali at Augur, Central India, on the 14th March,
1887, was a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame.The information has
not been forthcoming[53]; and for want of it I cannot corroborate the
following statement in a very strange story.In 1892 I passed two days at Jhansi, having been obliged to wait because
the gentleman whom I had gone to see on business was absent from the
station; and I went all over the city to try and pick up information
regarding the Mutiny.I eventually came across a man who, by his
military salute, I could see had served in the army, and I entered into
conversation with him.At first he pretended that his connection with the army had merely been
that of an armourer-_mistree_[54] of several European regiments; and he
told me that he had served in the armourer's shop of the Ninety-Third
when they were in Jhansi twenty-four years ago, in 1868 and 1869.After
I had informed him that the Ninety-Third was my regiment, he appeared to
be less reticent; and at length he admitted that he had been an armourer
in the service of Scindia before the Mutiny, and that he was in Cawnpore
when the Mutiny broke out, and also when the city was retaken by
Generals Havelock and Neill.After a long conversation he appeared to be convinced that I had no evil
intentions, but was merely anxious to collect reliable evidence
regarding events which, even now, are but slightly known.Amongst other
matters he told me that the (late) Maharaja Scindia was not by any means
so loyal as the Government believed him to be; that he himself (my
informant) had formed one of a deputation that was sent to Cawnpore from
Gwalior to the Nana Sahib before the outbreak; and that although keeping
in the background, the Maharaja Scindia incited his army to rebellion
and to murder their officers, and himself fled as a pretended fugitive
to Agra to devise means to betray the fort of Agra, should the Gwalior
army, as he anticipated would be the case, prove victorious over the
British.He also told me that the farce played by Scindia about 1874,
viz.the giving up a spurious Nana Sahib, was a prearranged affair
between Scindia and the _fakeer_ who represented the Nana.But, as I
expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, my friend came down to
more recent times, and asked me if I remembered about the murder of
Major Neill at Augur in Central India in 1887, thirty years after the
Mutiny?I told him that I very well remembered reading of the case in
the newspapers of the time.He then asked me if I knew why Major Neill
was murdered?I replied that the published accounts of the murder and
trial were so brief that I had formed the conclusion that something was
concealed from the public, and that I myself was of opinion that a woman
must have been the cause of the murder,--that Major Neill possibly had
been found in some intrigue with one of Mazar Ali's womenkind.To which
he replied that I was quite wrong.He then told me that Major Neill was
a son of General Neill of Cawnpore fame, and that Sowar Mazar Ali, who
shot him, was a son of Suffur Ali, _duffadar_ of the Second Regiment
Light Cavalry, who was unjustly accused of having murdered Sir Hugh
Wheeler at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_, and was hanged for the murder by
order of General Neill, after having been flogged by sweepers and made
to lick clean a portion of the blood-stained floor of the
slaughter-house.After the recapture of Cawnpore, Suffur Ali was arrested in the city,
and accused of having cut off General Wheeler's head as he alighted from
his palkee at the Suttee Chowrah _ghat_ on the 27th of June, 1857.This
he stoutly denied, pleading that he was a loyal servant of the Company
who had been compelled to join in the Mutiny against his will.General
Neill, however, would not believe him, so he was taken to the
slaughter-house and flogged by Major Bruce's sweeper-police till he
cleaned up his spot of blood from the floor of the house where the women
and children were murdered.When about to be hanged Suffur Ali adjured
every Mahommedan in the crowd to have a message sent to Rohtuck, to his
infant son, by name Mazar Ali, to inform him that his father had been
unjustly denied and flogged by sweepers by order of General Neill before
being hanged, and that his dying message to him was that he prayed God
and the Prophet to spare him and strengthen his arm to avenge the death
of his father on General Neill or any of his descendants.My informant went on to tell me that Mazar Ali had served under Major
Neill for years, and had been treated by him with special kindness
before he came to know that the Major was the son of the man who had
ordered his father's execution; that while he was lying ill in hospital
a _fakeer_ one day arrived in the station from some remote quarter of
India, and told him of his father's dying imprecation, and that Major
Neill being the son of General Neill, it was the decree of fate that
Mazar Ali should shoot Major Neill on parade the following day; which he
did, without any apparent motive whatever.I expressed my doubts about the truth of all this, when my informant
told me he could give me a copy of a circular, printed in Oordoo and
English, given to the descendants of Suffur Ali, directing them, as a
message from the other world, to avenge the death and defilement of
their father.The man eventually brought the leaflet to me in the _dak_
bungalow in Jhansi.The circular is in both Oordoo and English, and
printed in clean, clear type; but so far as I can read it, the English
translation, which is printed on the leaflet beneath the Oordoo, and a
copy of which I reproduce below, does not strike me as a literal
translation of the Oordoo.The latter seems to me to be couched in
language calculated to prove a much stronger incitement to murder than
the English version would imply.However, the following is the English
version _verbatim_, as it appears on the leaflet, word for word and
point for point, italics and all._The imprecation, vociferated by_ SUFFUR ALI,
      _Duffadar 2nd Regiment Light Cavalry, who was executed at
      the Slaughter-house, on the 25th July, 1857, for killing_
      SIR HUGH WHEELER, _at the Suttechoura Ghat_.be pleased to receive into Paradise the
      soul of your humble servant, whose body Major Bruce's Mehtur
      police are now defiling by lashes, forced to lick a space of
      the blood-stained floor of the Slaughter-house, and
      hereafter to be hanged, by the order of General Neill.And,
      oh Prophet!in due time inspire my infant son Mazar Ali of
      Rohtuck, that he may revenge this desecration on the General
      and his descendants._Take notice!_--Mazar Ali, Sowar, 2nd Regiment, Central
      India Horse, who under divine mission, shot Major A. H. S.
      Neill, Commanding the Corps, at Augur, Central India, on the
      14th March 1887, was sentenced to death by Sir Lepel
      Griffin, Governor-General's Agent.The Oordoo in the circular is printed in the Persian character without
the vowel-points, and as I have not read much Oordoo since I passed my
Hindoostanee examination thirty-three years ago, I have had some
difficulty in translating the leaflet, especially as it is without the
vowel-points.The man who gave it to me asked if I knew anything about
the family of General Neill, and I replied that I did not, which was the
truth.When I asked why he wanted to know, he said that if any more of
his sons were still in India, their lives would soon be taken by the
descendants of men who were defiled and hanged at Cawnpore under the
brigade-order of General Neill, dated Cawnpore, 25th of July, 1857.This
is the order to which I have alluded in the second chapter of my
reminiscences, and which remained in force till the arrival of Sir Colin
Campbell at Cawnpore in the following November.As I had never seen a
copy of it, having only heard of it, I asked my informant how he knew
about it.He told me that thousands of copies, in English, Oordoo, and
Hindee, were in circulation in the bazaars of Upper India.I told my
friend that I should very much like to see a copy, and he promised to
bring me one.Shortly after he left me in the _dak_ bungalow,
undertaking to return with a copy of the order, as also numerous
proclamations from the English Government, and the counter-proclamations
on the part of the leaders of the rebellion.I thought that here I had
struck a rich historical mine; but my friend did not turn up again!I
sat up waiting for him till long after midnight, and as he did not
return I went into the city again the following day to the place where I
had met him; but all the people around pretended to know nothing
whatever about the man, and I saw no more of him.However, I was glad to
have got the leaflet _re_ the assassination of Major Neill, because
several gentlemen have remarked, since I commenced my reminiscences,
that I mention so many incidents not generally known, that many are
inclined to believe that I am inventing history rather than relating
facts.But that is not so; and, besides what I have related, I could
give hundreds of most interesting incidents that are not generally known
nor ever will be known.[55]

Now, in my humble opinion, is the time that a history of the real facts
and causes of the Mutiny should be written, if a competent man could
devote the time to do so, and to visit the centres of the rebellion and
get those who took part in the great uprising against the rule of the
Feringhee to come forward, with full confidence of safety, and relate
all they know about the affair.Thousands of facts would come to light
which would be of immense historical importance, as also of great
political value to Government, facts that in a few years will become
lost to the world, or be remembered only as traditions of 1857.But the
man who is to undertake the work must be one with a thorough knowledge
of the native character and languages, a man of broad views, and, above
all, one who would, to a certain extent, sympathise with the natives,
and inspire them with confidence and enlist their assistance.As a rule,
the Englishman, the Government official, the _Sahib Bahadoor_, although
respected, is at the same time too much feared, and the truth would be
more or less concealed from him.I formed this opinion when I heard of
the circumstances which are supposed to have led to the assassination of
Major Neill.If true, we have here secret incitement to murder handed
down for generations, and our Government, with its extensive police and
its Thuggee Department, knowing nothing about it![56]

stating that, so far as it is possible at this date to corroborate
incidents that occurred thirty-five years ago, Mr.Forbes-Mitchell has
afforded us ample proof of the accuracy of his memory and the general
correctness of his facts.In the case under notice, we have been shown
the leaflet in which Mazar Ali's cold-blooded murder of his commanding
officer is vindicated, and of which the English translation above given
is an exact reproduction.The leaflet bears no evidence whatever to
disclose its origin, but we see no reason to doubt that, as Mr.Forbes-Mitchell's informant declared, it was widely circulated in the
bazaars of Upper India shortly after Mazar Ali paid the penalty of his
crime with his own life."--ED._Calcutta Statesman._

that no further explanation of Major Neill's murder by the son of a man
who was executed by the Major's father's orders is necessary.APPENDIX B

EUROPEANS AMONG THE REBELS


Although recollections of the Mutiny are fast being obliterated by the
kindly hand of time, there must still be many readers who will remember
the reports current in the newspapers of the time, and elsewhere in 1857
and 1858, of Europeans being seen in the ranks of the rebels.In a
history of _The Siege of Delhi, by an Officer who served there_ (name
not given), published by Adam and Charles Black, Edinburgh, 1861, the
following passages occur.After describing the battle of
Budlee-ke-Serai, the writer goes on to say: "The brave old Afghan chief,
Jan Fishan Khan,[57] who with some horsemen had followed our star from
Meerut, was heard crying out, his stout heart big with the enthusiasm of
the moment: 'Another such day, and I shall become a Christian!'"And in
his comments on this the writer says: "And sad to tell, a European
deserter from Meerut had been struck down fighting in the sepoy ranks,
and was recognised by his former comrades."After describing the opening
of the siege and the general contempt which the Europeans had for the
enemy's artillery, the writer states that the tone of conversation in
the camp was soon changed, and "From being an object of contempt, their
skill became one of wonder and admiration, perhaps too great.Some
artillery officers protested that their practice was better than our
own.Many believed that their fire was under the superintendence of
Europeans.Two men with solar helmets could be seen, by the help of our
best glasses, in their batteries, but no one who knew how much of the
work in India was really done by natives, wondered at the practical
skill they now showed."Turning from Delhi to Lucknow, many will
remember the account of the disastrous action at Chinhut by Mr.He
says: "The masses of the rebel cavalry by which the British were
outflanked near the Kookrail bridge, were apparently commanded by some
European who was seen waving his sword and attempting to make his men
follow him and dash at ours.He was a handsome-looking man, well-built,
fair, about twenty-five years of age, with light moustaches, wearing the
undress uniform of a European cavalry officer, with a blue, gold-laced
cap on his head."Rees suggests the possibility of this person
having been either a Russian or a renegade Christian.The only other case to which I will allude came under my own
observation.I have told in my fourteenth chapter how Brigadier Adrian
Hope was killed in the abortive attack on the fort of Rooyah, by a shot
fired from a high tree inside the fort, and how it was commonly believed
that the man who fired the shot was a European.I myself thought at the
time that such was the case, and now I am convinced of it.I was the
non-commissioned officer of a party of the Ninety-Third sent to cover an
engineer-officer who had either volunteered or been ordered to take a
sketch of one of the fort gates and its approaches, in the hope of being
able to blow it in, and thus gain an entrance to the fort, which was
surrounded by a deep ditch, and inside the ditch an almost impenetrable
belt of prickly bamboos about ten yards in breadth, so interwoven and
full of thorns that a cat could scarcely have passed through it.Under
the guidance of a native of the Intelligence Department, we managed to
advance unseen, and got under cover of a thick clump of bamboos near the
gate.Strict orders had been given that no one on any account whatever
was to speak, much less to fire a shot, unless we should be attacked,
for fear of drawing attention to our proceedings, till the engineer had
had time to make a rough sketch of the position of the gate and its
approaches.During this time we were so close to the fort that we could
hear the enemy talking inside; and the man who was on the tree could be
seen and heard by us quite plainly, calling to the stormers on the other
face in unmistakable barrack-room English: "Come on, you ----
Highlanders!you have a harder nut to crack than eating
oatmeal porridge.If you can come through these bamboos we'll warm your
---- for you, if you come in here!"In short, the person
talking showed such a command of English slang and barrack-room abuse
that it was clear he was no native.Every one of my party was convinced
that the speaker was a European, and if we had been aware at the time
that this man had just killed Brigadier Hope he would certainly have
paid the penalty with his own life; but we knew nothing of this till we
retired, and found that the stormers had been recalled, with the
butcher's bill already given.The events above related had almost passed from my recollection, till
they were recalled by the following circumstance.A vacancy having
occurred among the _durwans_[58] in the factory under my charge, among
several candidates brought by the _jemadar_[59] for the vacant post was
a fine-looking old man, who gave me an unmistakable military salute in
the old style, square from the shoulder--quite different from the
present mongrel German salute, which the English army has taken to
imitating since the Germans beat their old conquerors, the French; I
mean the present mode of saluting with the palm of the hand turned to
the front.As soon as I saw this old man I knew he had been a soldier;
my heart warmed to him at once, and I determined to give him the vacant
appointment.So turning to him I said: "You have served in the army; are
you one of the sepoys of 1857?"He at once admitted that he had formerly
belonged to the Ninth Native Infantry, and that he was present with the
regiment when it mutinied at Allyghur on the 20th of May, 1857.He had
accompanied the regiment to Delhi, and had fought against the English
throughout the siege, and afterwards at Lucknow and throughout the Oude
campaigns."But, _Sahib_" said he, "the Ninth Regiment were almost the
only regiment which did not murder their officers.We gave each of them
three months' pay in advance from the treasury, and escorted them and
their families within a safe distance of Agra before we went to Delhi,
and all of us who lived to come through the Mutiny were pardoned by the
Government."I knew this to be the truth, and ordered the _jemadar_ to
enrol the applicant, by name Doorga, or Doorga Sing, late sepoy of the
Ninth Native Infantry, as one of the factory _durwans_, determining to
have many a talk with him on his experiences of the Mutiny.Many of my readers may recollect that, after escorting their European
officers to the vicinity of Agra, the Ninth Regiment went to Delhi, and
throughout the siege the men of this regiment proved the most daring
opponents of the British Army.According to Mead's _Sepoy Revolt_, "The
dead bodies of men bearing the regimental number of the Ninth Regiment
were found in the front line of every severe engagement around Delhi and
at the deadly Cashmere Gate when it was finally stormed."After engaging
Doorga Sing it was not long before I made him relate his experiences of
the siege of Delhi, and afterwards at Lucknow and in Oude, and one day I
happened to ask him if it was true that there were several Europeans in
the rebel army.He told me that he had heard of several, but that he
personally knew of two only, one of whom accompanied the mutineers from
Meerut and was killed at the battle of Budlee-ke-Serai,--evidently the
deserter alluded to above.The other European was a man of superior
stamp, who came to Delhi from Rohilcund with the Bareilly Brigade, and
the King gave him rank in the rebel army next to General Bukht Khan, the
titular Commander-in-Chief, This European commanded the artillery
throughout the siege of Delhi, as he had formerly been in the Company's
artillery and knew the drill better than any man in the rebel army.I
asked Doorga Sing if he had ever heard his name or what rank he held
before the Mutiny, and he said he had heard his name at the time, but
had forgotten it, and that before the Mutiny he had held the rank of
sergeant-major, but whether in the native artillery or in one of the
native infantry regiments at Bareilly he did not now recollect.But the
Badshah promoted him to be general of artillery immediately on the
arrival of the Bareilly Brigade, and he was by far the bravest and most
energetic commander that the rebels had, and the most esteemed by the
revolted sepoys, whose respect he retained to the last.Even after they
had ceased saluting their native officers they continued to turn out
guards and present arms to the European _sahib_.Throughout the siege of
Delhi there was never a day passed that this man did not visit every
battery, and personally correct the elevation of the guns.He fixed the
sites and superintended the erection of all new batteries to counteract
the fire of the English as the siege advanced.On the day of the
assault, the 14th of September, he fought like _shaitan_,[60] fighting
himself and riding from post to post, trying to rally defeated sepoys,
and bringing up fresh troops to the support of assailed points.Doorga
Sing's company had formed the guard at the Cashmere Gate, and he vividly
described the attack and defence of that post, and how completely the
sepoys were surprised and the powder-bags fixed to the gate before the
sentries of the guard were aware of the advance of the English.After the assault Doorga Sing did not see the European till the beaten
army reached Muttra, when he again found him superintending the
arrangements for crossing the Jumna.About thirty thousand sepoys had
collected there in their retreat from Delhi, a common danger holding
them together, under the command of Bukht Khan and Feroze Shah.But they
paid more respect to the European, and obeyed his orders with far more
alacrity than they did those of Bukht Khan or any other of their nominal
leaders.After crossing the Jumna the European remained with the rebels
till they reached a safe retreat on the Oude side of the Ganges, when he
left the force in company with the Raja of Surajpore, a petty state on
the Oude side about twenty or twenty-five miles above Cawnpore.About
this time my informant, Doorga Sing, having been wounded at Delhi, left
the rebel army _en route_ to Lucknow, and returned to his village near
Onao in Oude; but hearing of the advance of the English, and expecting
no mercy, he and several others repaired to Lucknow, and rejoined their
old comrades.He did not again see the European till after the fall of Lucknow, when
he met him at Fort Rooyah, where he commanded the sepoys, and was the
principal adviser of the Raja Nirput Singh, whom he prevented from
accepting the terms offered by the English through General Walpole.I am
fully convinced that this was the man whom we saw in the tree, and who
was reported to have killed Brigadier Hope.After their retreat from Rooyah the sepoys, under this European,
remained in the jungles till the English army had passed on to Bareilly,
when they reattacked Shahjehanpore, and would have retaken it, if a
brigade had not arrived from Bareilly to its relief.After being driven
back from Shahjehanpore the sepoys held together in Mahomdee, Sitapore,
and elsewhere, throughout the hot season of 1858, mostly under the
guidance of the European and Bukht Khan.The last time Doorga Sing saw
the renegade was after the battle of Nawabgunge in Oude, where Bukht
Khan was killed and a large number of the sepoys were driven across the
Raptee into Nepaul territory, upon which they held a council among
themselves and determined to follow their leaders no longer, but to give
themselves up to the nearest English post under the terms of the Queen's
proclamation.The European tried to dissuade them from doing this,
telling them that if they gave themselves up they would all be hanged
like dogs or sent in chains across the _Kala Pani_.[61] But they had
already suffered too much to be further imposed upon, and one of their
number, who had gone to get information about other parties who were
known to have given themselves up to the English, returned at this time
with information that all sepoys who had not taken part in murdering
their officers were, after giving up their arms, provided with a pass
and paid two rupees each, and allowed to return to their villages.On
this the greater part of the sepoys, including all left alive of the
Ninth Regiment, told the European that they had resolved to listen to
him no longer, but to return to their villages and their families, after
giving themselves up at the nearest English post.Thereupon the _sahib_
sat down and commenced to shed tears, saying _he_ had neither home nor
country to return to.There he was left, with a few more whose crimes
had placed them beyond the hope of pardon; and that was the last which
Doorga Sing saw or heard of the European general of the mutineer
artillery.Before writing this, I have often cross-questioned Doorga Sing about
this European, and his statements never vary.He says that the time is
now so long past that he could not be sure of the _sahib's_ name even if
he heard it; but he is positive he came from Bareilly, and that his rank
before the Mutiny was sergeant-major, and that he had formerly been in
the Company's artillery.He thinks, however, that at the time of the
Mutiny this sergeant was serving with one of the native infantry
regiments in Bareilly; and he further recollects that it was commonly
reported in the sepoy ranks that when the Mutiny broke out this
sergeant-major had advised the murder of all the European officers,
himself shooting the adjutant of the regiment with his own hand to prove
his loyalty to the rebel cause.The whole narrative is so extraordinary that I publish it with a view to
discovering if there are any still living who can give facts bearing on
this strange, but, I am convinced, true story.Doorga Sing promised to
find for me one or two other mutineer sepoys who knew more about this
European and his antecedents than he himself did.I have no detailed
statement of the Mutiny at Bareilly, and the short account which I
possess merely says that, "As soon as the artillery fired the signal gun
in their lines, Brigadier Sibbald mounted his horse and galloped off to
the cavalry lines, but was met on the way by a party of infantry, who
fired on him.He received a bullet in his chest, and then turned his
horse and galloped to the appointed rendezvous for the Europeans, and,
on arriving there, dropped dead from his horse."The account then goes
on to say: "The European sergeant-major had remained in the lines, and
Adjutant Tucker perished while endeavouring to save the life of the
sergeant-major."The question arises--Is it possible that this
sergeant-major can have been the same man whom Doorga Sing afterwards
met in command of the rebel ranks in Delhi, and who was said to have
killed his adjutant?FOOTNOTES:

A FEW WORDS ON SWORD-BLADES


A short time back I read an article on sword-blades, reprinted I believe
from some English paper.Now, in a war like the Mutiny sword-blades are
of the utmost importance to men who depend on them either for taking or
preserving life; I will therefore state my own experience, and give
opinions on the swords which came under my observation, and I may at
once say that I think there is great room for improvement in our blades
of Birmingham manufacture.I consider that the swords supplied to our
officers, cavalry and artillery, are far inferior as weapons of offence
to a really good Oriental _tulwar_.Although an infantry man I saw a
good deal of sword-practice, because all the men who held the
Secundrabagh and the Begum's Kothee were armed with native _tulwars_
from the King of Oude's armoury, in addition to their muskets and
bayonets, and a large proportion of our men were killed and wounded by
sword-cuts.In the first place, then, for cutting our English regulation swords are
too straight; the Eastern curved blade is far more effective as a
cutting weapon.Secondly, our English swords are far too blunt, whereas
the native swords are as keen in edge as a well-stropped razor.Our
steel scabbards again are a mistake for carrying sharp blades; and, in
addition to this, I don't think our mounted branches who are armed with
swords have proper appliances given to them for sharpening their edges.Even in time of peace, but especially in time of war, more attention
ought to be given to this point, and every soldier armed with a sword
ought to be supplied with the means of sharpening it, and made to keep
it with an edge like a razor.I may mention that this fact was noticed
in the wars of the Punjab, notably at Ramnugger, where our English
cavalry with their blunt swords were most unequally matched against the
Sikhs with _tulwars_ so keen of edge that they would split a hair.I remember reading of a regiment of British cavalry charging a regiment
of Sikh cavalry.The latter wore voluminous thick _puggries_ round their
heads, which our blunt swords were powerless to cut through, and each
horseman had also a buffalo-hide shield slung on his back.They
evidently knew that the British swords were blunt and useless, so they
kept their horses still and met the British charge by lying flat on
their horses' necks,[62] with their heads protected by the thick turban
and their backs by the shields; and immediately the British soldiers
passed through their ranks the Sikhs swooped round on them and struck
them back-handed with their sharp, curved swords, in several instances
cutting our cavalry men in two.In one case a British officer, who was
killed in the charge I describe, was hewn in two by a back-handed stroke
which cut right through an ammunition-pouch, cleaving the pistol-bullets
right through the pouch and belt, severing the officer's backbone and
cutting his heart in two from behind.It was the same in the Balaclava
charge, both with the Heavy and the Light Brigade.Their swords were too
straight, and so blunt that they would not cut through the thick coats
and sheep-skin caps of the Russians; so that many of our men struck with
the hilts at the faces of the enemy, as more effective than attempting
to cut with their blunt blades.In the article on English sword-blades to which I have referred, stress
is laid on the superiority of blades of spring steel, tempered so that
the tip can be bent round to the hilt without breaking or preventing the
blade assuming the straight immediately it is released.Now my
observations lead me to consider spring steel to be totally unfitted for
a sword-blade.The real Damascus blade that we have all read about, but
so few have seen, is as rigid as cast-iron, without any spring
whatever,--as rigid as the blade of a razor.The sword-blade which bends
is neither good for cut nor thrust, even in the hands of the most expert
and powerful swordsman.A blade of spring steel will not cut through the
bone; directly it encounters a hard substance, it quivers in the hand
and will not cut through.Let any sword-maker in Birmingham try
different blades in the hands of an expert swordsman on a green tree of
soft wood, and the rigid blade of well-tempered steel will cut four
times as deep as the blade of highly tempered spring steel which you can
bend into a circle, tip to hilt.My opinion is that the motto of a
sword-blade ought to be the same as the Duke of Sutherland's--"_Frangas
non flectes_, Thou mayest break but not bend"; and if blades could be
made that would neither break nor bend, so much the better.I believe that the manufacture of real Damascus steel blades is a lost
art.When serving in the Punjab about thirty years ago, I was well
acquainted with an old man in Lahore who had been chief armourer to
Runjeet Sing, and he has often told me that the real Damascus blades
contained a large percentage of arsenic amalgamated with the steel while
the blades were being forged, which greatly added to their hardness,
toughness, and strength, preserved the steel from rust, and enabled the
blades to be sharpened to a very fine edge.This old man's test for a
sword-blade was to get a good-sized fish, newly caught from the river,
lay it on a soft, yielding bed,--cotton quilt folded up, or any soft
yielding substance,--and the blade that did not cut the fish in two
across the thickest part behind the gills, cutting against the scales,
at one stroke, was considered of no account whatever.From what I have
seen no sword-blade that bends, however sharp it may be, will do that,
because the spring in the steel causes the blade to glance off the fish,
and the impetus of the cut is lost by the blade quivering in the hand.Nor will any of our straight sword-blades cut a large fish through in
this manner; whereas the curved Oriental blade, with a drawing cut,
severs it at once, because the curved blade presents much more cutting
surface.One revolution of a circular saw cuts much deeper into wood
than one stroke of a straight saw, although the length of the straight
saw may be equal to the circumference of the circular one.So it is with
sword-blades.A stroke from a curved blade, drawn through, cuts far
deeper than the stroke from a straight blade.[63]

I will mention one instance at Lucknow that came under my own notice of
the force of a sword-cut from a curved sword of rigid steel.There were
three brothers of the name of Ready in the Ninety-Third called David,
James, and John.They were all powerful, tall men, in the prime of life,
and all three had served through the Crimea.David was a sergeant, and
his two brothers were privates.When falling in for the assault on the
Begum's palace, John Ready took off his Crimean medal and gave it to his
brother David, telling him that he felt a presentiment that he would be
killed in that attack, and that David had better keep his medal, and
send it home to their mother.David tried to reason him out of his
fears, but to no purpose.John Ready replied that he had no fear, and
his mother might know that he had died doing his duty.Well, the assault
took place, and in the inner courts of the palace there was one division
held by a regiment of dismounted cavalry, armed with swords as keen as
razors, and circular shields, and the party of the Ninety-Third who got
into that court were far out-numbered on this occasion, as in fact we
were everywhere else.On entering James Ready was attacked by a _sowar_
armed with sword and shield.Ready's feather bonnet was knocked off, and
the _sowar_ got one cut at him, right over his head, which severed his
skull clean in two, the sword cutting right through his neck and
half-way down through the breast-bone.John Ready sprang to the
assistance of his brother, but too late; and although his bayonet
reached the side of his opponent and was driven home with a fatal
thrust, in doing so he came within the swoop of the same terrible sword,
wielded by the powerful arm of a tall man, and he also was cut right
through the left shoulder diagonally across the chest, and his head and
right arm were clean severed from the body.The _sowar_ delivered his
stroke of the sword at the same moment that he received the bayonet of
John Ready through his heart, and both men fell dead together.David
Ready, the sergeant, seized the _tulwar_ that had killed both his
brothers, and used it with terrible effect, cutting off heads of men as
if they had been mere heads of cabbage.When the fight was over I
examined that sword.It was of ordinary weight, well-balanced, curved
about a quarter-circle, as sharp as the sharpest razor, and the blade as
rigid as cast-iron.Now, my experience is that none of our very best
English swords could have cut like this one.A sword of that quality
would cut through a man's skull or thigh-bone without the least quiver,
as easily as an ordinary Birmingham blade would cut through a willow.I may also mention the case of a young officer named Banks, of the
Seventh Hussars, who was terribly cut up in charging through a band of
Ghazis.One leg was clean lopped off above the knee, the right arm cut
off, the left thigh and left arm both cut through the bone, each wound
produced by a single cut from a sharp, curved _tulwar_.I don't know if
the young fellow got over it;[64] but he was reported to be still alive,
and even cheerful when we marched from Lucknow.In this matter of sword-blades, I have no wish to dogmatise or to pose
as an authority; I merely state my observations and opinion, in the
hopes that they may lead to experiments being made.The sharpening of our cavalry swords, if still the same as
in 1857, receives far too little attention.FOOTNOTES:

[62] In which case they would have been simply ridden over.Mitchell's are quite true as regards curved
swords; but he forgets that the _point_ is the most effective attack
against Eastern swordsmen.APPENDIX D

THE OPIUM QUESTION


On the afternoon of the 19th August, 1892, I left Cawnpore for Lucknow.As I was a few minutes before time, I walked along the railway-platform
to see the engine, and, strange to relate, the engine attached to the
train which was to take me into Lucknow (under circumstances very
different from those of 1857) was No.In 1857 I had crossed the
Ganges in the ranks of the Ninety-Third Highlanders, with the figures 93
on the front of my cap, and here I was, under very different
circumstances, revisiting Lucknow for the first time thirty-five years
after, and the engine to the train was No.I need not say that I
lifted my hat to that engine.As a matter of fact, I never do pass the
old number without giving it a salute; but in this instance I looked
upon it as a happy omen for the success of my journey.I took my seat in the carriage, and shortly after was joined by a
gentleman whom I took to be a Mahommedan; but to my surprise he told me
that he was a Christian employed in the Educational Department, and that
he was going to Lucknow for a month's holiday.He appeared to be a man
of over sixty years of age, but said he was only fifty-four, and that he
would retire from Government service next year.Of course I introduced
the subject of the Mutiny, and asked him where he had been at the time.He stated that when the Mutiny broke out he was at school in Bareilly,
and that he was then a Mahommedan, but did not join in the rebellion;
that on the outbreak of the Mutiny, when all the Europeans were either
killed or fled from Bareilly, he had retired to his village near
Shahjehanpore, and remained there till order was re-established on the
advance of the English into Rohilcund in May, 1858, after Khan Bahadoor
Khan had reigned in Bareilly twelve months.In course of conversation I asked my companion if he could give any
reason why it was that the whole rural population of Oude had joined the
urban population against the British in 1857, whereas on the south side
of the Ganges the villagers were in favour of the British, where they
were not overawed by the mutineers?He told me a strange thing, and that
was that he was fully convinced that the main reason why the village
population of Oude joined the city population of Lucknow was owing to
the oppression caused by our introduction of the opium-tax among the
people.At first I misunderstood him, and thought I had come across an agent of
the Anti-Opium Society."So you are against Government control of the
opium-cultivation and sale of the drug," I said."I consider the tax on opium a most legitimate source of
revenue.What I mean is that although a just tax, it was a highly
obnoxious one to the citizens of Lucknow and the rural population of
Oude at the time of the Mutiny."He went on to state that although a
Christian convert from Mahommedanism and a strictly temperate man, he
had no sympathy with the anti-opium party; that he considered them a
most dangerous set of fanatics, who would set the whole country in
rebellion again before a twelve-month if they could get the Government
to adopt their narrow-minded views.Regarding 1857, he continued, and I
quote his exact words, as I noted them down immediately after I got to
the hotel:

"Under the rule of the Nawabs of Lucknow many taxes were imposed, which
were abolished by the British; but in their stead the opium-tax was
introduced, which was the most unpopular tax that could have been
devised, because it touched every one, from the _coolie_ in the bazaar
to the noble in his palace.Before the annexation of Oude opium was
untaxed, and was largely consumed by all classes of the people, both in
the capital and in the villages.Though the mass of the people were
well-affected to British rule in general, disloyal agitators had merely
to cite the opium-tax as a most obnoxious and oppressive impost, to
raise the whole population against the British Government, and the same
would be the case again, if ever the British Government were weak enough
to be led by the Anti-Opium Society.""Then," said I, "since you are so much against the Anti-Opium Society, I
suppose you are also against Christian missionaries.""That by no means
follows," was the answer."Many of our most Christian and able
missionaries have as little sympathy with the anti-opium propagandists
as I have.The true missionary aims at reforming the people through the
people, not by compelling moral reformation through the Government,
which would be merely a return to the Inquisition of Rome in another
form.I would encourage missionaries by every possible means; but they
must be broad-minded, earnest, pious men, who mind their own business,
and on no pretence whatever attempt to dictate to Government, or to
control its action either in the matter of taxation or in any other way.I would never encourage men who go about the country railing against the
Government for collecting revenue from one of the most just sources that
can be named.Missionaries of experience know that the mass of the
population are miserably poor, and a pill of opium is almost the only
stimulant in which they indulge.Then, why attempt to deprive them of
it, merely to please a score or so of sentimental faddists?Let the
missionaries mind their own business, and render to Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's.Let them
confine themselves to proclaiming the Gospel to the heathen, and teach
the Bible in their schools; but don't allow them to mix in politics, or
in any way interfere with the government or taxation of the country.I
would throw the English education of the people more into the hands of
the missionaries.Our Government schools are antichristian, and are
making infidels of the people."THE END

dark.You have nice brown hair, and are whiter than I am.""Some like dark people best," suggested Dan.I asked auntie to buy me a big cake of soap to wash the brown
off, but it wouldn't come."He thought the bright, vivacious little face, with the
brilliant dark eyes, pretty, though Althea did not."You will like to live with Dan, my dear?""I have got to go away--on business.""I don't want you to go away, auntie," she said."Dan and I can't live
alone.""Dan has a mother, who will be very good to you."asked Althea, brightening up."And you will come to see me some time, auntie?""Then I will go with Dan;" and the little girl placed her hand
confidingly in that of our hero.Dan thought it would be pleasant for him to have a little sister, and he
knew that it would brighten his mother's existence."Shall we go now, madam?"She drew from her pocket a wallet
containing a considerable sum of money."I will hand you two months' payment in advance," she said, "and
afterward I will remit you monthly, or direct you where to call for
money.Two months at fifty dollars will amount to one hundred, and
twenty more for Althea's dress will make it up to a hundred and twenty."Whenever I have any to be careful about," answered Dan."I hope you will be comfortably provided from this time.There is a
little trunk of Althea's clothes in the trunk-room below.I will write
you an order for it, but you may as well wait till you have moved before
carrying it away."Then you shall go into supper with Althea and myself.""I'm afraid I don't look fit."At any rate, it's nobody's business.There was nothing to say, so Dan followed the mysterious lady into the
supper-room, Althea clinging to his hand.He felt awkward as he took his
seat.Suppose some one should recognize him as the newsboy who usually
stood in front of the Astor House!The young lady whom Tom Carver was escorting boarded at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, and had alighted at the same time with our hero, though he did
not observe it.Tom had been invited to supper, and, with Julia and her father, was
seated at a neighboring table when Dan entered.Tom could hardly credit his eyes when he saw Dan entering the
supper-room, with the little girl clinging to his hand.he ejaculated, forgetting his manners in his
surprise."I beg your pardon, but I was so astonished.There is that newsboy
coming into supper!""What a pretty little girl is with him!""You must be mistaken about your friend being a newsboy.""Your acquaintance, then; though he is nice enough looking to be a
friend.I saw him selling papers yesterday in front of the Astor
House.""His business must be good, or he would not board at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.""Of that boy at the next table, pa."Why, that's my young friend of the ferry-boat.Tom, have the
kindness to ask him to come here a moment and speak to me."Much surprised, and considerably against his will, Tom rose and walked
over to where Dan was sitting."Look here," said he; "come over to the next table, will you?""There's a gentleman wants to speak to you."Rogers, of the firm of Barton &
Rogers, who had asked him to call at his place of business on Pearl
street."Not as a rule," answered Dan, smiling."Then, Dan, let me make you acquainted with my daughter, Julia.""I think you were sitting opposite me in the stage, Mr."You were polite enough to hand me my handkerchief when I awkwardly
dropped it.""Dan, this young gentleman is Thomas Carver.Carver a long time," said Dan, smiling."You didn't tell me that, Tom," said Julia Rogers, turning to Tom."No," said Tom, embarrassed; "it is a good while ago.""I won't detain you any longer from your friends," said Mr."I shall see you at the office in the morning.""Where did you meet him, papa?"Her father told the story of Dan's exploit on the ferry-boat."He is a very smart boy," he said."I shall probably take him into my
employ."All this was very disagreeable to Tom Carver, but he did not venture to
say all that he felt, being somewhat in awe of Mr."They are making a great fuss over a common newsboy," he muttered to
himself.After supper, Dan prepared to take Althea home with him.She felt so
well acquainted already that she made no objection, but, hand-in-hand,
left the hotel with Dan.He halted a Broadway stage, and they got in."Are you carrying me to where you live, Dan?""Will your mother be glad to see me?"She wants a little girl to keep her
company."Mordaunt was apprised by Fanny that Dan had gone up town with a
lady, and therefore was not alarmed when he did not return home at the
usual time.She hoped he would clear fifty cents, but had no idea to
what extent their fortunes would be advanced by Dan's evening's work."I will save Dan some supper," she said to herself.So, mother-like, she supped economically herself, on a cup of tea and
some dry bread, and bought a bit of steak for Dan's supper, for she
thought he would be very hungry at so late an hour.It was nearly half-past eight when she heard Dan's well known step on
the stairs.She opened the door to welcome him, but the cheerful welcome upon her
lips died away in surprise when she saw his companion."She is going to be my little sister, mother," said Dan, gayly.said Althea, releasing Dan's hand, and putting
her own confidingly in that of Mrs."Yes, my dear," said the widow, her heart quite won by the little girl's
innocent confidence, and she bent over and kissed her."It means that Althea is to board with us, and be company for you.I
have agreed with her aunt that you will take her.""But does her aunt know that we live in such a poor place?"asked his
mother in a tone of hesitation."Yes, mother, but that makes no difference, as we shall move up town
to-morrow.""I am sure you have acted for the best, Dan, but it seems so strange.""Will it seem strange to receive fifty dollars a month for Althea's
board?"I didn't suppose we ought to charge more."Are you a great eater,
Althea?""Sometimes I am," said the little girl, naively."Never mind, I guess there will be enough."I didn't know there
would be two, but I will go cut and buy some more meat, if you can
wait.""I have had supper, mother, or dinner rather.I dined with Althea and
her aunt at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.""Has Althea been stopping there, Dan?""Then how can she stay even one night in this poor place?"Althea, do you mind stopping here just one night?We
will go to a better place to-morrow.""No, Dan, I don't care.""There, mother, I told you so, Althea is a brick.""What a funny boy you are, Dan!A brick is red and
ugly, and I am not.""No, Althea, you are not ugly, but your cheeks are red.""They don't look like a brick, Dan.""I had got your supper all ready, Dan," said his mother, regretfully."You didn't have any meat, I'll warrant.Now, like a good mother, sit
down and eat the steak."Assured that Dan had supped well, Mrs.Mordaunt didn't resist his
advice.Dan looked on, and saw with pleasure that his mother relished the meat."We will be able to live better hereafter, mother," he said."There
won't be any stinting.Fifty dollars will go a good ways, and then,
besides, there will be my earnings.I forgot to tell you, mother, that I
have probably got a place.""Our good fortune is coming all at once, Dan," said Mrs.I think it has come to stay, too.""I feel so tired," said Althea, at this point.In twenty minutes the little girl was in a sound sleep.Dan was not
sorry, for he wanted to tell his mother about the days adventures, and
he could do so more freely without any one to listen."So, mother," he concluded, "we are going to turn over a new leaf.We
can't go back to our old style of living just yet, but we can get out of
this tenement-house, and live in a respectable neighborhood.""God has been good to us, Dan."I know it, mother, but somehow I don't think of that as quick as you.Who do you think I saw in the supper-room at the Fifth Avenue?He was wonderfully puzzled to know how I happened to be
there.He told the party he was with that I was a common newsboy.""He is a very mean boy," said Mrs."After being
so intimate with you too."He can't do me any harm, and I don't care for his
friendship.The time may come when I can meet him on even terms."I shall work along, and if I get rich I
sha'n't be the first rich man that has risen from the ranks."Early the next morning Dan started out in search of a new home.He and his mother decided that they would like to live somewhere near
Union Square, as that would be a pleasant afternoon resort for their
young boarder."No, Dan, I have not time this morning."Very well, mother; I will do my best."Dan crossed Broadway, and took a horse-car up town.In West Sixteenth street his attention was drawn to the notice,
"Furnished Rooms to Let," upon a good-looking brick house.He rang the bell, and asked to see the lady of the house.A stout, matronly looking woman, with a pleasant face, answered the
servant's call."I called to inquire for rooms," said Dan."For my mother, and sister, and myself.""I have a large back room on the third floor, and a small room on the
fourth floor."It was neatly carpeted and furnished, and had a cheerful outlook."This will do for mother and Althea," he said."Yes, ma'am, but I am sure that will suit.It is for me, and I am not
particular.But there's one thing that may trouble us.""I will give her the privilege of using my kitchen.I don't care to
take boarders, as it would be too much care, but your mother is welcome
to use my kitchen stove.""Leave that to your mother and myself," said Mrs."How much do you want for your rooms?""Of course; that is all I ask."We will pay it," said Dan, quite relieved, for he feared he should have
to pay more."I generally ask a week's rent in advance," said Mrs.Brown, "but in
your case I won't insist upon it.""Oh, it is perfectly convenient," said Dan, and he drew out his
pocket-book containing the money--over a hundred dollars--which Althea's
aunt had given him.Brown's respect for Dan was considerably increased by this display
of wealth, and she congratulated herself on securing such substantial
lodgers.This business accomplished Dan went down town, and informed his mother
of the arrangement he had made.Mordaunt, Althea, and
he were installed in their new home, much to the regret of Mrs.Rafferty, who regretted losing so good a neighbor.Before this, however,
Dan sought the counting-room of Barton & Rogers.DAN BECOMES A DETECTIVE.Barton & Rogers evidently did business in a large way.They occupied an
imposing-looking building of five stories, the greater part being used
to store goods.A spare,
dark-complexioned man of about thirty-five, with a pen behind his ear,
was issuing orders to a couple of workmen."No, he is not," said the dark man, curtly."You might be more civil," thought our hero.He stood his ground, feeling authorized to do so because he had come by
appointment.Observing this, the book-keeper turned and said, sharply:

"Didn't you hear?"I heard you," said Dan, quietly."Not at all, sir; but Mr."Thank you, but I don't think that would do."The book-keeper eyed him sharply, and his face lighted up with a sudden
discovery."You sell papers in front of the Astor House,
don't you?""I thought so; I have bought papers of you."Rogers wants me, I suppose, or he would not have asked me to call,"
returned Dan."Not always," said Dan, with a smile."Some hot days I am far from
cool."Rogers wishes you to supply him with an evening paper?""Perhaps he does," returned Dan, with a smile."In the supper-room of the Fifth Avenue Hotel."demanded Talbot, the book-keeper, in
surprise."I was taking supper," said Dan, rather enjoying the others surprise,
"and Mr.Do you often take supper at the Fifth Avenue Hotel?""I'm willing to change places with you."you are here before me, Dan," he remarked, pleasantly."No, sir; only about five minutes.""I must keep you waiting a few minutes longer while I look at my
letters.The letters have arrived, have they not, Mr."Amuse yourself as you like while you are waiting, Dan," said the
merchant.Talbot, the book-keeper, followed the merchant into the
counting-room, and Dan was left alone.He looked about him with
interest, thinking it probable that this was to be his future business
home.It would certainly be a piece of good fortune to become attached
to so large and important a house, and he felt in very good spirits,
though he foresaw that Mr.Talbot would not make it very pleasant for
him.But with his employer on his side he need not be alarmed."I have to go out a few minutes," he said to Dan."Come with me, and we
can talk on the way."Talbot followed the two with a frown upon his brow."How on earth has that boy managed to get round Mr."I hope he won't be foolish enough to take him in here."Talbot had a nephew whom he was anxious to get into the business, and
Dan's engagement would interfere with his little plan.This partly
accounts for his brusque reception of Dan on his first arrival."Well, how do you like our place of business, Dan?""Would you rather sell papers or take employment with me?""I should like very much to be in your employ, sir.""How much did you earn as a newsboy?""When I was lucky I made a dollar a day.""Then I ought to give you six dollars a week."It is more than boys generally get at the
start, but I am willing to pay a good sum to a boy who suits me.""I will try to suit you, sir.""Do you know why I take you into my employ?""I feel kindly disposed to you, Dan, but that is not my chief reason."Dan was puzzled, and waited to hear more."My attention was drawn to you on the ferry-boat.I observed your
detection of the mean scamp who cheated a poor flower-girl by offering
her bad money, and I inferred that you were sharp and keen.""That is the sort of boy I want just now."I don't think he admires me much," he answered."He wanted to clear me
out before you came in.""Yes; he recognized me as a newsboy."He has a nephew whom he wishes me to
engage."Perhaps his nephew would suit you better, sir," said Dan, modestly."Are you willing to resign in his favor?""I prefer to leave that to you, sir."The nephew is a disagreeable boy, who would not
suit me at all.He thinks more of dress than of duty, and, if I read him
aright, is lazy and incompetent.Talbot has spoken to
me about taking him.""Perhaps he doesn't know his nephew's faults.""He knows them well enough, but is desirous of promoting his interests.He won't look upon you very favorably when he learns that I have engaged
you.""If you are satisfied, I won't care for that."And now for a few words in confidence," and Mr."Our business is a large one, and the sums of
money handled are necessarily large.Three months since I ascertained
that somewhere in my establishment there was a leak.We are losing money
in some unexplained way.I believe that some one in whom I repose
confidence is betraying me."Talbot," he said, in the same low voice."It seems strange, perhaps, that I should speak so confidentially to
you--a mere boy--but I am impressed with the idea that you can help me.""If I can, sir, I will," said Dan, earnestly.My first injunction is to say no word, even to your
nearest relations, of what I have told you."I want to know what are his habits,
whether he uses money freely, with whom he associates.Can you, without
betraying to him that he is watched, find out some information for me on
these points?""If you secure any information, never communicate it to me in the
office.Either come to my house, or write me there.""You understand that I am employing you in a detective capacity, and
that your time will partly be taken up out of business hours.I intend
to pay you extra, according to results.Rogers, but I am afraid you will be disappointed in
me.""Have you any directions to give me, sir, as to how to go to work?""No; I am nothing of a detective myself.I might,
of course, employ a professional detective, but Talbot is sharp, and he
would suspect.He won't dream of my employing a
boy.That is all I have to say for the present."To-morrow let it be, then.Rogers shook hands with our hero, and walked away."I am afraid I have a hard job on my hands," thought Dan, "but I will do
my best."DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's mother was much pleased with her new quarters.The large room,
occupied by Althea and herself, was bright and cheerful, and well
furnished.Besides the ordinary chamber furniture, there was a
comfortable arm-chair and a lounge.Mordaunt felt that she would
not be ashamed now to receive a visit from some of her former friends.She had anticipated some trouble about the preparation of meals, but
Mrs.Brown made a proposition which wonderfully removed all
difficulties.Mordaunt," she said, "your family is about the same as mine.I
have a son who is employed in a newspaper office down town, and you have
two young children.Now, suppose we club together, and each pay half of
the table supplies.Then one day you can superintend the cooking--you
will only have to direct my servant Maggie--and the next day I will do
it.Then, every other day, each of us will be a lady of leisure, and not
have to go into the kitchen at all."The arrangement will be so much to my advantage that I can say only
one thing--I accept with thanks.But won't you be doing more than your
share?You will be furnishing the fuel, and pay Maggie's wages.""I should have to do that at any rate.The plan is perfectly
satisfactory to me, if it suits you."Mordaunt found that the expense was not beyond her means.Her
income for the care of Althea was fifty dollars a month, and Dan paid
her four dollars a week out of his wages, reserving the balance as a
fund to purchase clothes.She went herself to market and selected
articles for the table, and, for the first time since her husband's
failure, found herself in easy circumstances.There was no need now to make vests at starvation prices.She had
thought of continuing, but Dan insisted upon her giving it up entirely."If you want to sew, mother," he said, "you can make some of Althea's
clothes, and pay yourself out of the ten dollars a month allowed for her
clothes."Mordaunt decided to follow Dan's
advice.She lost no time in obtaining books for the little girl, and
commencing her education.Althea knew her letters, but nothing more.She
was bright and eager to learn, and gained rapidly under her new teacher.Naturally, Dan and his mother were curious as to Althea's early
history, but from the little girl they obtained little information."Do you remember your mother, Althea?"Only a little while before you brought me here.""Your mother isn't dead, is she?"Poor mamma cried very much
when she went away.She kissed me, and called me her darling.""Perhaps her lungs are affected, and she has gone to a warmer climate,"
suggested Mrs."She may have gone to Florida, or even to
Italy."asked Dan, turning to Althea."Father is a bad man," said the child, positively."He came back once, and then mamma cried again.I think he wanted mamma
to give him some money."Dan and his mother talked over the little girl's revelations, and
thought they had obtained a clew to the mystery in which the child's
history was involved.Althea's mother might have married a man of bad
habits, who wanted to get possession of her fortune, and rendered a
separation necessary.Ill health might have required her to leave home
and shift the care of the little girl upon strangers.It seemed rather
odd that she should have been handed over to utter strangers, but there
might have been reasons of which they knew nothing."We won't trouble ourselves about it," said Dan."It's good luck for us,
even if it was bad luck for Althea's mother.I like the idea of having a
little sister."Althea's last name was not known to her new protector.When Dan
inquired, he was told that she could pass by his name, so Althea
Mordaunt she became.Both Dan and his mother had feared that she might become homesick, but
the fear seemed groundless.She was of a happy disposition, and almost
immediately began to call Mrs."I call you mother," she said, "but I have a mamma besides; but she has
gone away.""You must not forget your mamma, my dear," said the widow.She will come back some day; she said she would.""And I will take care of you till she does, Althea.""I am glad I came to you, for now I have
a brother Dan.""And I have a little sister," said Dan.While Dan was away, and now he was away after supper regularly, Althea
was a great deal of company for Mrs.In the pleasant afternoons she took the little girl out to walk,
frequently to Union Square Park, where she made acquaintance with other
little girls, and had a merry time, while her new mother sat on one of
the benches.One day a dark-complexioned gentleman, who had been looking earnestly at
Althea, addressed Mrs."That is a fine little girl of yours, madam," he said."She does not resemble you much," he said, inquiringly."No; there is very little resemblance," answered Mrs.Mordaunt, quietly,
feeling that she must be on her guard.Mordaunt did not reply, and the stranger thought she was offended."I beg your pardon," he said, "but she resembles a friend of mine, and
that called my attention to her."Mordaunt bowed, but thought it wisest not to protract the
conversation.She feared that the inquirer might be a friend of the
father, and hostile to the true interests of the child.For a week to come she did not again bring Althea to the park, but
walked with her in a different direction.When, after a week, she
returned to the square, the stranger had disappeared.At all events, he
was not to be seen.Talbot heard of his engagement with anything but satisfaction.He
even ventured to remonstrate with Mr."Do you know that this boy whom you have engaged is a common newsboy?""I have bought a paper more than once of him, in front of the
Astor House.""It is none of my business, but I think you could easily get a better
boy.There is my nephew----"

"Your nephew would not suit me, Mr."Won't you give him a trial?""If Dan should prove unsatisfactory, would you try my nephew?"It was an incautious concession, for it was an inducement to the
book-keeper to get Dan into trouble.It was Dan's duty to go to the post-office, sometimes to go on errands,
and to make himself generally useful about the warehouses.As we know,
however, he had other duties of a more important character, of which Mr.The first discovery Dan made was made through the book-keeper's
carelessness.Rogers was absent in Philadelphia, when Talbot received a note which
evidently disturbed him.Dan saw him knitting his brows, and looking
moody.Finally he hastily wrote a note, and called Dan."Take that to -- Wall street," he said, "and don't loiter on the way."On reaching the address, Dan found that Jones & Robinson were stock
brokers."Tell him we will carry the stocks for him a week longer, but can't
exceed that time.""Perhaps you had better write him a note," suggested Dan, "as he may not
like to have me know his business.""I believe I have made a discovery," he said to himself.Talbot is
speculating in Wall street.I wonder if he speculates with his own money
or the firm's?"His face, however, betrayed nothing as he handed the note to the
book-keeper, and the latter, after a searching glance, decided that
there was nothing to fear in that quarter.Talbot's operations, if the reader
will accompany him to a brownstone house on Lexington avenue, on the
evening of the day when Dan was sent to the office of the Wall street
brokers.Talbot ascended the steps, not with the elastic step of a man with
whom the world is prospering, but with the slow step of a man who is
burdened with care.he inquired of the servant who answered the
bell."Will you tell her I should like to speak with her?"Talbot walked in with the air of one who was familiar with the house,
and entering a small front room, took a seat.The furniture was plain, and the general appearance was that of a
boarding-house.Talbot seemed immersed in thought, and only raised his eyes from the
carpet when he heard the entrance of a young lady.His face lighted up,
and he rose eagerly."My dear Virginia," he said, "it seems a long time since I saw you.""It is only four days," returned the young lady, coolly."Four days without seeing you is an eternity."It was easy to see that Talbot was in love, and
she was not."Not good news," said he, soberly.Before going further, it may be as well to describe briefly the young
lady who had so enthralled the book-keeper.She had the advantage of youth, a complexion clear red and white, and
decidedly pretty features.If there was a defect, it was the expression
of her eyes.There was nothing soft or winning in her glance.She
seemed, and was, of a cold, calculating, unsympathetic nature.She was
intensely selfish, and was resolved only to marry a man who could
gratify her taste for finery and luxurious living.Sinclair, who kept the boarding-house, and
though living in dependence upon her aunt, did nothing to relieve her
from the care and drudgery incidental to her business."It's too provoking," she said, pouting."So it is, Virginia;" and Talbot tried to take her hand, but she quietly
withdrew it."You told me that you would have plenty of money by this time, Mr."I expected it, but a man can't foresee the fluctuations of Wall street.I am afraid I shall meet with a loss.""I don't believe you are as smart as Sam Eustis--he's engaged to my
cousin.He made ten thousand dollars last month on Lake Shore.""It's the fools that blunder into luck," said Talbot, irritated."Then you'd better turn fool; it seems to pay," said Virginia, rather
sharply."No need of that--I'm fool enough already," said Talbot, bitterly."Oh, well, if you've only come here to make yourself disagreeable, I'm
sure you'd better stay away," said the young lady, tossing her head."I came here expecting sympathy and encouragement," said Talbot."Instead, you receive me with taunts and coldness.""I will be cheerful
and pleasant when you bring me agreeable news.""Why will you require
impossibilities of me?I have an income of two thousand
dollars a year.We can live comfortably on that, and be happy in a snug
little home.""Thank you; I'd
rather not.It means that I am to be a
household drudge, afraid to spend an extra sixpence--perhaps obliged to
take lodgers, like my aunt.""I am sure you cannot love me when you so coolly give me up for money.""I haven't given you up, but I want you to get money.""Where there's a will, there's a way, Mr.If you really care so
much for me, you will try to support me as I want to live.""Tell me, in a word, what you want.""Well," said Virginia, slowly, "I want to go to Europe for my
honey-moon.I've heard so much of Paris, I know I should like it ever
so much.Then I want to live _respectably_ when I get back.""Well, we must have a nice little house to ourselves, and I think, just
at first, I could get along with three servants; and I should want to go
to the opera, and the theater, and to concerts.""You have not been accustomed to live in that way, Virginia.""No; and that's why I have made up my mind not to marry unless my
husband can gratify me.""Yes, I think so," said Virginia, coolly."And you would desert me for a richer suitor?""Of course I would rather marry you--you know that," said Virginia, with
perfect self-possession; "but if you can't meet my conditions, perhaps
it is better that we should part.""No; only sensible," she returned, calmly."I don't mean to marry you
and be unhappy all my life; and I can't be happy living in the stuffy
way my aunt does.We should both be sorry for such a marriage when it
was too late.""I will take the risk, Virginia," said Talbot, fixing his eyes with
passionate love on the cold-hearted girl."But I will not," said Virginia, decidedly."I am sure you needn't take
it to heart, Mr.Why don't you exert yourself and win a fortune,
as other people do?I am sure plenty of money is made in Wall street."Come now, smooth your face, and tell me you will
try," she said, coaxingly."Yes, Virginia, I will try," he answered, his face clearing."And if I
try----"

"You will succeed," she said, smiling."And now don't let us talk about disagreeable things.Do you know, sir,
it is a week since you took me to any place of amusement?And here I
have been moping at home every evening with my aunt, who is terribly
tiresome, poor old soul!""I would rather spend the evening here with you, Virginia, than go to
any place of amusement.""I don't--if you call by that name being in the company of one you
love.""You would, if you had as little variety as I have.""Tell me one thing, Virginia--you love me, don't you?"asked Talbot, in
whose mind sometimes there rose an unpleasant suspicion that his love
was not returned."Why, of course I do, you foolish man," she said, carelessly."And now,
where are you going to take me?""Where do you want to go, my darling?"To-morrow they play 'The Huguenots.'""I thought you didn't care for music, Virginia?"I want to go because it's fashionable, and I want
to be seen.So, be a good boy, and get some nice seats for to-morrow
evening.""And you'll try to get rich, for my sake?""As soon as you can tell me you have ten thousand dollars, and will
spend half of it on a trip to Europe, I will marry you.""Then I hope to tell you so soon."When Talbot left the house it was with the determination to secure the
sum required by any means, however objectionable.Virginia Conway followed his retreating form with her cool, calculating
glance."I'll give him
two months to raise the money, and if he fails, I think I can captivate
Mr.Cross was a middle-aged grocer, a widower, without children, and
reputed moderately wealthy.Talbot had entered the house, Dan was not far off.Later, he
saw him at the window with Virginia."I suppose that's his young lady," thought Dan.I guess he's
safe for this evening."Stocks took an upward turn, so that Talbot's brokers were willing to
carry them for him longer without an increase of margin.The market
looked so uncertain, however, that he decided to sell, though he only
made himself whole.To escape loss hardly satisfied him, when it was so
essential to make money.He was deeply in love with Virginia Conway, but there was no hope of
obtaining her consent to a marriage unless he could raise money enough
to gratify her desires.He was returning to his boarding-house at a late hour one night, when,
in an unfrequented street, two figures advanced upon him from the
darkness, and, while one seized him by the throat, the other rifled his
pockets.Talbot was not a coward, and having only a few dollars in his
pocket-book, while his watch, luckily, was under repair at Tiffany's, he
submitted quietly to the examination.The pocket-book was opened and its contents eagerly scanned.An exclamation of disgust mingled with profanity followed."Why don't you carry money, like a gentleman?""Ain't you ashamed to carry such a lean wallet as that there?""Really, gentlemen, if I had expected to meet you, I would have provided
myself better," said Talbot, not without a gleam of humor."He's chaffing us Bill," said Mike."You'd better not, if you know what's best for yourself," growled Bill.You ought to have waited till next week, when I'd have
had it for you.""Yes; but they are small, and not worth much.""You've took us in reg'lar!A gent like you ought to have diamond studs,
or a pin, or something of value.""I know it, and I'm sorry I haven't, for your sakes."I look upon you as gentlemen, and treat you
accordingly.In fact, I'm glad I've met with you.""I may be able to put something in your way.""I can't tell you in the street.Is there any quiet place, where we
shall not be disturbed or overheard?""This may be a plant," said Mike, suspiciously."If it is," growled Bill, "you'd better make your will.""I know the risk, and am not afraid.In short, I have a job for you."The men consulted, and finally were led to put confidence in Talbot."We'll hear what you have to say.The three made their way to a dilapidated building on Houston street,
and ascended to the fourth floor.Bill kicked open the door of a room with his foot and strode in.A thin, wretched-looking woman sat in a wooden chair, holding a young
child."Just clear out into the other
room.She meekly obeyed the command of her lord, glancing curiously at Talbot
as she went out.Mike she knew only too well, as one of her husband's
evil companions.The door was closed, but the wife bent her ear to the keyhole and
listened attentively.Suspecting nothing, the conspirators spoke in louder tones than they
were aware of, so that she obtained a pretty clear idea of what was
being planned."Now go ahead," said Bill, throwing himself on the chair his wife had
vacated."We might,'specially if we knowed the combination."Talbot gave the name of his employer and the number of his store."What have you got to do with it?"What are you going to make out of it?"I'll guarantee that you'll find four hundred dollars
there to pay you for your trouble.""If we're caught, it'll be Sing Sing for seven years.""We might do it for five hundred apiece," said Bill.There was a little discussion, but finally this was acceded to.Various
details were discussed, and the men separated."I'm goin' your way," said Mike."All right, thank you, but we'd better separate at the street door."Are you too fine a gentleman to be seen with the likes of me?""Not at all, my friend; but if we were seen together by any of the
police, who know me as book-keeper, it would excite suspicion later."I shouldn't dare to tamper with men like you and Bill.You might find a way to get even with me."said the miserable wife to herself, as she heard through
the keyhole the details of the plan."Bill is getting worse and worse
every day."Here, Nancy, get me something to eat," said Bill, when his visitors had
departed."Yes, Bill, I will get you all there is."The wife brought out from a small closet a slice of bread and a segment
of cheese.said the burly ruffian, turning up his nose."It's all I've got, Bill.""You and your brat have eaten it!"If you will give money, I will provide better."I'll teach you to
complain of me.and he struck the woman two brutal
blows with his fist.One, glancing, struck the child, who began to cry.This further irritated Bill, who, seizing his wife by the shoulders,
thrust her out on the landing."There, stay there with the cursed brat!""I mean to have
one quiet night."The wretched wife crept down stairs, and out into the street, scarcely
knowing what she did.She was not wholly destitute of spirit, and
though she might have forgiven personal injury, felt incensed by the
treatment of her innocent child.she said, pitifully, "must you suffer because your
father is a brute?She sat down on some steps near by; the air was chilly, and she shivered
with the cold, but she tried to shelter her babe as well as she could.She attracted the attention of a boy who was walking slowly by.It was Dan, who had at a distance witnessed Talbot's encounter with the
burglars, and his subsequent friendly companionship with them, and was
trying to ascertain the character of the place which he visited.asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy.[Illustration: "What's the matter with you?"asked Dan, in a tone of
sympathy.Page 148]

"My husband has thrust me out of doors with my poor baby.""I can let you have enough for that.I'll
take you to it, and pay for your lodging, and pay for it in advance."Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not
far away."She may know something about Talbot's visit.DAN AS A GOOD SAMARITAN."What made your husband treat you so badly?""Rum has been sinking him lower and lower,
and it's easy to see the end.""You are taking too dark a view of your husband," said Dan, soothingly."He won't go as far as that.""I know him only too well," she said."This very evening he has been
planning a burglary."Dan started, and a sudden suspicion entered his mind."Yes; it is a store on Pearl street."Dan felt that he was on the track of a discovery.He was likely to be
repaid at last for the hours he had spent in detective service.he asked, fixing his eyes intently on the woman."I don't know his name; he is a well-dressed man."Was it a man who came to your rooms this evening?"Here Dan gave a rapid description of
Talbot.He is the book-keeper of the firm."He is to pay a thousand dollars for the job."Bill, I suppose, is your husband?"By this time they had reached a small public-house, of humble exterior,
but likely to afford his companion better accommodations than she had at
home.The woman followed him, with the child in her arms.A stout German, who
appeared to be the proprietor of the establishment, was sitting in an
arm-chair, smoking a pipe.asked the German, with a broad grin."No; she is an acquaintance of mine.Her husband has driven her out of
his house in a fit of drunkenness.asked the Dutchman, shrewdly."Fifty cents a night for the lodging."asked the landlord, upon whom the silver
half-dollar produced a visible impression."Yes," said the woman; "my poor baby is tired.""You had better stay here two nights," said Dan."Don't let your husband
know where you are just yet.Here is money to pay for another night's
lodging, and enough to buy food besides.""But for you I should have
had to stay out all night.""Oh, no; some one would have taken you in.""You don't know this neighborhood; the policeman would have found me,
and taken me to the station-house.For myself I care little; but my poor
babe, who is worse than fatherless----" and she burst into tears.Brighter days may be in store," said Dan,
cheerfully."I will come and see you day after to-morrow," said Dan.Our hero must not be awarded too great credit for his generosity.Rogers would willingly defray all expenses connected with
the discovery, and that the money he had advanced to his unfortunate
companion would be repaid.Had it been otherwise, however, his generous
heart would have prompted him to relieve the woman's suffering.Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr."The master won't be up for an hour," said the servant."Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.""I don't think he'll see you.He was up late last night," she said."It's very important you make yourself," said Susan, crossly."I _am_ a person of great importance," said Dan, smiling.Rogers
will see me, you'll find."Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered."You're to walk into the parlor," she said.Rogers came down stairs almost
directly in dressing-gown and slippers."The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!""By two men living in Houston street--at least, one lives there.""Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr.Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with
it some further information he had drawn from the woman."I didn't think Talbot capable of this," said Mr."He has been
in our employ for ten years.I don't like to think of his treachery,
but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it.Now, Dan, what is your
advice?""I am afraid my advice wouldn't be worth much, Mr.Rogers," said Dan,
modestly.I am indebted to you for this important
discovery.I won't promise to follow your
advice, but I should like to hear it.""Then, sir, I will ask you a question.Do you want to prevent the
robbery, or to catch the men in the act?""I wish to catch the burglars in the act.""Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?"But how can I take measures to guard
against loss?""No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks.He will draw money if I am
not at the store."He is to tell the burglars the combination.He will
get it from the janitor.""I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong
word.""I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the
time comes.""Then," continued Dan, flushing with excitement, "we'll wait till the
burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe.While they are at
work, we will nab them.""Yes, sir; I want to be there.""I don't know about that, sir.But if anything is going on to-night, I
want to be in it."Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank,
what shall I do?""He may make off with the money during the day.""I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in
that event.""This is going to be an exciting day," said Dan to himself, as he set
out for the store.TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and
nervous.Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply
for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning."I'm a little late this morning, Mr."Oh, well, you can be excused for once," said Talbot.He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor.Besides, he intended
to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best
to be on friendly terms with him.About ten o'clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr.It was to this effect:


     "I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come
     to the store.Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send
     a messenger to my house."The only obstacle to
carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his
employer.About one o'clock he called Dan into the office."Here, Dan," he said, "I want you to go to the bank at once.""Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars--rather a heavy amount--and
you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see
that you have so much with you."You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in
large bills.""He means to make a big haul," said Dan to himself, as he left the
store."I hope our plans won't miscarry.Rogers to
lose so large a sum."As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a
lamp-post, eyed him sharply.As Dan was turning the corner of the street
he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him."You are in the employ of Barton & Rogers, are you not?""I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr."He is the book-keeper, is he not?"There is no need of watching till you bring
back the money.Where do you think Talbot will put the money?""In the safe, I think, sir."I believe he will retain the greater part on his
own person.If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money
they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he
agrees to pay them.""I shall take care to keep Talbot in view.He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken
by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the
safe.""It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money," he said."Don't be afraid," he said, confidentially."Talbot won't leave the
city.His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without
misgivings.The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully.There was no doubt about its being correct, however."Be very careful, young man," said the disbursing clerk."You've got too
much to lose."Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat,
and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat."I'm a boy of fortune for a short time," he said to himself."I hope
the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own."Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and
it gave him a feeling of security.Some one might have seen the large
sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such
circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday
and robbed.He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would
interfere in such a case.asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting
him."I don't carry one," said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously."Nor I. I have been very unfortunate.Can't you give me a quarter to buy
me some dinner?""Ask some one else; I'm in a hurry," said Dan, coldly."I'm not as green as you take me for," said Dan to himself.He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken.Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard, emerging from Dan knew
not where, laid his hand on his shoulder."Boy," said he, in a fierce undertone, "give me that money you have in
your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.""You forget we are in the public street," said Dan."And you would be--stunned, perhaps killed!""Look here,
boy, I am a desperate man.I know how much money you have with you.Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at
hand.This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only
speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk.He
gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one
side, calling:

"Stop thief!"The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his
arm was grasped as by an iron vise.exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to
a policeman."You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.""I have taken nothing," he
added, sullenly.I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave
up the money in his possession."Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully.Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan's
arrival very anxiously."No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the
point of attacking me."Talbot asked no further questions, considerably to Dan's relief, for he
did not wish to mention the detective if it could be avoided.The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as
he received the money:

"You can't be too careful when you have much money about you.I am
almost sorry I sent for this money," he proceeded."I don't think I
shall need to use it to-day.""Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?""No; I shall put it in the safe over night.I don't care to risk you or
the money again to-day.""He won't put it in the safe."TALBOT'S SCHEME FAILS.Talbot went into the office where he was alone.But the partition walls
were of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he
could see all that passed within.The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two
parcels.One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it "$12,000."The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket.Dan
saw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills
assigned to the different packages.He had no doubt, however, that the
smaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the
safe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained
only about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank.Indeed, he was not observed,
except by Dan, whose business it was to watch him.The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package
therein.He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside,
but for some time had no opportunity.About an hour later he was sent out on an errand.He looked about him in
a guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside
detective.The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him
carelessly."Well," he asked, "have you any news?"Talbot has divided the money into two
packages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket."He means to appropriate the greater part to his own
use.""Is there anything more for me to do?"Does the book-keeper suspect that he
is watched?""I am afraid he will get away with the money," said Dan, anxiously.Do you know whether there's any woman in the case?""He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue."It is probably on her account that he wishes to
become suddenly rich."This supposition was a correct one, as we know.It did not, however,
argue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive
is more common in such cases.Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred
during the remainder of the day.Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor."You may lock the safe," he said."By the way, you may use the word 'Hartford' for the combination.""Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of
money--twelve thousand dollars.""Wouldn't it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr."Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it
to-day.However, it is secure in the safe," he added, carelessly."I have no doubt of that, Mr.In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who
was leaning against a lamp-post."I beg your pardon," said the book-keeper, politely."Hartford," said Talbot, in a low tone."They've got the word," said Talbot to himself."Now the responsibility
rests with them.His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her
name.He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a
position to win the consent of the object of his passion.He knew, or,
rather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated.It
was enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him.In a
few days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love.Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars
would be credited to the burglars.If his
European journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be
proved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock
speculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway.He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of
obtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her
with a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety.Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling
upon him inquiringly."Well," she said, "have you any news to tell me?""Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?"asked Talbot,
eagerly."I make so many promises, you know," she said, fencing."Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?"I dared everything, and I have
succeeded.""As you might have done before, had you listened to me."Ten thousand dollars--the amount you required.""We will make the grand
tour?"She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek.It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid
for the wrong and wickedness he had done.It would not always be so,
even if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy."Now let us form our plans," he said."Will you marry me to-morrow
evening?"We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow
evening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife.On Saturday a
steamer leaves for Europe.I can hardly believe that I shall so soon
realize the dreams of years."How can you be spared from your business?""No; not till you are almost ready to start.""It is better that there should be no gossip about it.Besides, your
aunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist
upon delay.That's something we should neither of us be willing to
consent to.""No, for it would interfere with our European trip.""You consent, then, to my plans?""Yes; I will give you your own way this time," said Virginia, smiling."And you will insist on having your own way ever after?""Of course," she said; "isn't that right?""I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule,
you must not be a tyrant, my darling."Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from
the first.He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took
leave of Miss Conway at the door.He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his
coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm.He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man--the detective."You are suspected
of robbing the firm that employs you."exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face,
though his heart sank within him."I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search.If my
suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize."I will give you into
custody."The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a
policeman."Take this man into custody," he said.exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale."You will be searched at the station-house, Mr."I hope nothing will be found to criminate you.Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled
it into the darkness.The detective darted after it, and brought it back."This is what I wanted," he said."Policeman, you will bear witness
that it was in Mr.I fear we shall have to detain
you a considerable time, sir."Fate had turned against him, and he was
sullen and desperate.he asked himself; but no answer suggested
itself.In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence
of his wife and child.Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to
where she had gone."I'm better without her," he said to his confederate, Mike."She's
always a-whinin' and complainin', Nance is.If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can't
always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry.I like to see a woman have
some spirit, I do.""They may have too much," said Mike, shrugging his shoulders."My missus
ain't much like yours.If I speak rough to
her, she ups with something and flings it at my head."Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that's the best way.""Why, you're not half a man, you ain't.Do
you want to know what I'd do if a woman raised her hand against me?""I'd beat her till she couldn't see!"said Bill, fiercely; and he looked
as if he was quite capable of it."You haven't got a wife like mine.""Just you take me round there some time, Mike.If she has a tantrum,
turn her over to me."He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the
proposal did not strike him favorably.His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he
was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from
using it to subdue her.So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced
vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities.Had
she been Bill's wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have
been bloodshed."I say, Bill," said Mike, suddenly, "how much did your wife hear of our
plans last night?""If she had she would not dare to say a word," said Bill, carelessly."She knows I'd kill her if she betrayed me," said Bill."There ain't no
use considerin' that.""Well, I'm glad you think so.It would be awkward if the police got wind
of it.""What do you think of that chap that's puttin' us up to it?""I don't like him, but I like his money.""Five hundred dollars a-piece ain't much for the risk we run.""If we don't find more in the safe, we'll bleed him when all's over.It was true that Bill was the leading spirit.He was reckless and
desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the
danger incurred.They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and
though both had served a short term of imprisonment, they had in
general escaped scot-free.It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at
the close of the afternoon the "combination," which was to make the
opening of the safe comparatively easy."It's a good thing to have a friend inside," he said to his confederate."There'll be the janitor to dispose of," suggested Mike."Don't kill him if you can help it, Bill.Murder has an ugly look, and
they'll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar.He can wake up when we're
gone, but we'll tie him so he can't give the alarm."Obey
orders, and I'll bring you out all right."So the day passed, and darkness came on.The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had
been a sailor.Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated
him for his early vocation.It had not, however, impaired his physical
strength, which was very great, and Mr.Rogers was glad to employ him in
his present capacity.When Jack Green--Jack was the name he generally went by--heard of the
contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased.It was becoming
rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and
he fancied he should like a little scrimmage.He even wanted to
withstand the burglars single-handed."What's the use of callin' in the police?""It's only two men,
and old Jack is a match for two.""You're a strong man, Jack," said Dan, "but one of the burglars is as
strong as you are.He's broad-shouldered and
big-chested.""I ain't afraid of him," said Jack, defiantly."Perhaps not, but there's another man, too.But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were
admitted about eight o'clock, and carefully secreted, to act when
necessary.Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first,
and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken
in the act.Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part
not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to
do as he was told.It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance.This was effected about twelve o'clock, and by the light of a
dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe.At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm
and dismay.he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in
making tremulous."Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm."All right; I'll do it myself.The word agreed with the information
they had received from Talbot.It served to convince them that the
janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon.There was no
suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the
establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption."Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work.Just behave
yourself, and we'll give you ten dollars--shall we, Mike?""Yes," answered Mike; "I'm agreed.""It'll look as if I was helpin' to rob my master," objected Jack."Oh, never mind about that; he won't know it.When all is over we'll tie
you up, so that it will look as if you couldn't help yourself.Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering
him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered:

"I'm a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.""All right," said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack's fidelity was
very cheaply purchased.He plumed himself on his success in converting
the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him."Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me."Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which
he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe.It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy
approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan.Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as
he was crouching before him, exclaiming:

"Now, you villain, I have you!"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was,
was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance."You'll repent this, you old idiot!"he hissed between his closed teeth,
and, in spite of old Jack's efforts to keep him down, he forced his way
up.At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden
attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack's life was
likely to be of a very brief tenure.But here the reinforcements
appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle.One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in
hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the
heads of the two captives.In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the
lantern, cried, exultingly:

"If I am an old idiot, I've got the better of you, you scoundrels!It was hard for him to give in, but the
fight was too unequal."Mike," said he, "this is a plant.I wish I had that cursed book-keeper
here; he led us into this.""Yes," answered Bill; "he put us up to this."No need to curse him," said Jack, dryly; "he meant you to succeed.""Didn't he tell you we were coming to-night?""How did you find it out, then?""It wasn't enough; but we should have got more out of him.""Before you go away with your prisoners," said Jack to the policeman, "I
wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions.Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led
us to think that he deposited it in the safe.I wish to ascertain, in
the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he
carried away.""That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then."Burglar," said old Jack, indifferently."There's an
old saying, 'Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.'Your
cursing won't hurt me any.""If my curses don't my fists may!"retorted Bill, with a malignant look."You won't have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to
come, if you get your deserts," said Jack, by no means terrified."I've
only done my duty, and I'm ready to do it again whenever needed."By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money
labeled "$12,000."The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts
and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat.They had been so near
success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term
of years.muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said
amen."Gentlemen, I will count this money before you," said the janitor, as he
opened the parcel.It resulted, as my readers already
know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel
contained but one thousand dollars."Gentlemen, will you take
notice of this?Of course it is clear where the rest is gone--Talbot
carried it away with him.""By this time he is in custody," said Jack."Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?""Come here, Dan," said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in
the background.Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of
defeating you.We should have known nothing of your intentions but for
Dan, the Detective.""Why, I could crush him with one hand.""Force is a good thing, but brains are better," said Jack."Dan here has
got a better head-piece than any of us.""You've done yourself credit, boy," said the chief policeman."When I
have a difficult case I'll send for you.""You are giving me more credit than I deserve," said Dan, modestly."If I ever get out of jail, I'll remember you," said Bill, scowling."I
wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the
heels by a boy like you--that's enough to make me sick.""You've said enough, my man," said the policeman who had him in charge.The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way
to the station-house.They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten
years' term of imprisonment.As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found
on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this
statement fell to the ground before Dan's testimony and that of Bill's
wife.He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his
just deserts.*       *       *       *       *       *       *

On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr.Rogers called Dan
into the counting-room."Dan," he said, "I wish to express to you my personal obligations for
the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this
burglary.""I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand
dollars.It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been
a heavy loss.""Such a loss as that would have ruined me," said Dan, smiling."So I should suppose," assented his employer."I predict, however, that
the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something
left.""As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that."Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed
to Dan.This was the way it read:


     No.Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars.Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so.When
he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity."It is a large sum for a boy like you,
Dan."But, sir, you don't mean all this for me?"It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved
for us.""How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?"By the way, what wages do we pay
you?""It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House,
isn't it, Dan?"Now, Dan, let me give you two
pieces of advice.""First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don't draw upon it
unless you are obliged to."And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education.You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you
should still be learning.It may help you, in a business point of view,
to understand book-keeping."Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German,
of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all.Punctually every month Dan received a remittance of sixty dollars
through a foreign banker, whose office was near Wall street.Of this sum it may be remembered that ten dollars were to be
appropriated to Althea's dress.Of the little girl it may be said she was very happy in her new home.Mordaunt, whom she called mamma,
while she always looked forward with delight to Dan's return at night.Mordaunt was very happy in the child's companionship, and found the
task of teaching her very congenial.But for the little girl she would have had many lonely hours, since Dan
was absent all day on business."I don't know what I shall do, Althea, when you go to school," she said
one day."I don't want to go to school.Let me stay at home with you, mamma.""For the present I can teach you, my dear, but the time will come when
for your own good it will be better to go to school.I cannot teach you
as well as the teachers you will find there.""You know ever so much, mamma."Compared with you, my dear, I seem to know a great deal, but there are
others who know much more."Althea was too young as yet, however, to attend school, and the happy
home life continued.Mordaunt and Dan often wondered how long their mysterious ward was
to remain with them.If so, how could that
mother voluntarily forego her child's society?These were questions they sometimes asked themselves, but no answer
suggested itself.They were content to have them remain unanswered, so
long as Althea might remain with them.The increase of Dan's income, and the large sum he had on interest,
would have enabled them to live comfortably even without the provision
made for their young ward.Dan felt himself justified in indulging
in a little extravagance."Mother," said he, one evening, "I am thinking of taking a course of
lessons in dancing.""What has put that into your head, Dan?""Julia Rogers is to have a birthday party in two or three months, and I
think from a hint her father dropped to-day I shall have an invitation.I shall feel awkward if I don't know how to dance."Tom Carver will be sure to be there, and if I don't dance, or if I am
awkward, he will be sure to sneer at me.""Will that make you feel bad, Dan?""Not exactly, but I don't want to appear at disadvantage when he is
around.If I have been a newsboy, I want to show that I can take the
part of gentleman as well as he.""Does the ability to dance make a gentleman, Dan?""No, mother, but I should feel awkward without it.I don't want to be a
wall-flower.What do you say to my plan, mother?""Carry it out by all means, Dan.There is no reason why you shouldn't
hold up your head with any of them," and Mrs.Mordaunt's eyes rested
with pride on the handsome face and manly expression of her son."You are a little prejudiced in my favor, mother," said Dan, smiling."If I were as awkward as a cat in a strange garret, you wouldn't see
it."He selected a
fashionable teacher, although the price was high, for he thought it
might secure him desirable acquaintances, purchased a handsome suit of
clothes, and soon became very much interested in the lessons.He had a
quick ear, a good figure, and a natural grace of movement, which soon
made him noticeable in the class, and he was quite in demand among the
young ladies as a partner.He was no less a favorite socially, being agreeable as well as
good-looking.Mordaunt," said the professor, "I wish all my scholars did me as
much credit as you do."Thank you, sir," said Dan, modestly, but he felt gratified.By the time the invitation came Dan had no fears as to acquitting
himself creditably."I hope Tom Carver will be there," he said to his mother, as he was
dressing for the party.Rogers lived in a handsome brown-stone-front house up town.As Dan approached, he saw the entire house brilliantly lighted.He
passed beneath a canopy, over carpeted steps, to the front door, and
rang the bell.The door was opened by a stylish-looking <DW52> man, whose grand air
showed that he felt the importance and dignity of his position.As Dan passed in he said:

"Gentlemen's dressing-room third floor back."With a single glance through the open door at the lighted parlors, where
several guests were already assembled, Dan followed directions, and went
up stairs.Entering the dressing-room, he saw a boy carefully arranging his hair
before the glass."That's my friend, Tom Carver," said Dan to himself.Tom was so busily engaged at his toilet that he didn't at once look at
the new guest.When he had leisure to look up, he seemed surprised, and
remarked, superciliously:

"I didn't expect to see _you_ here.""Are you engaged to look after this room?"With all my heart, if you'll brush me," answered Dan, partly offended
and partly amused."Our positions are rather different, I think."You are a guest of Miss Rogers, and so am I.""You don't mean to say that you are going down into the parlor?""A boy who sells papers in front of the Astor House is not a suitable
guest at a fashionable party.""That is not your affair," said Dan, coldly."But it is not true that I
sell papers anywhere.""And I will again, if necessary," answered Dan, as he took Tom's place
in front of the glass and began to arrange his toilet.Then, for the first time, Tom took notice that Dan was dressed as well
as himself, in a style with which the most captious critic could not
find fault.He would have liked
to see Dan in awkward, ill-fitting, or shabby clothes.It seemed to him
that an ex-newsboy had no right to dress so well, and he was greatly
puzzled to understand how he could afford it."It is not remarkable that I should be well dressed."So can I," answered Dan, laconically."Do you mean to say that you bought that suit and paid for it?""You are very kind to take so much interest in me.It may relieve your
mind to see this."Dan took a roll of bills from his pocket, and displayed them to the
astonished Tom."I don't see where you got so much money," said Tom, mystified."I've got more in the bank," said Dan."I mention it to you that you
needn't feel bad about my extravagance in buying a party suit.""I wouldn't have come to this party if I had been you," said Tom,
changing his tone."You'll be so awkward, you know.You don't know any one except Miss
Rogers, who, of course, invited you out of pity, not expecting you would
accept.""You forget I know you," said Dan, smiling again."I beg you won't presume upon our former slight acquaintance," said Tom,
hastily."I shall be so busily occupied that I really can't give you any
attention.""Then I must shift for myself, I suppose," said Dan, good-humoredly."Go first, if you like," said Tom, superciliously."He doesn't want to go down with me," thought Dan."Perhaps I shall
surprise him a little;" and he made his way down stairs.As Dan entered the parlors he saw the young lady in whose honor the
party was given only a few feet distant.He advanced with perfect ease, and paid his respects."I am very glad to see you here this evening, Mr.Mordaunt," said Julia,
cordially."I had no idea he would look
so well."Mentally she pronounced him the handsomest young gentleman present."Take your partners for a quadrille, young gentlemen," announced the
master of ceremonies."Not as yet," answered the young lady, smiling.So it happened that as Tom Carver entered the room, he beheld, to his
intense surprise and disgust, Dan leading the young hostess to her place
in the quadrille."I suppose he
never attempted to dance in his life.It will be fun to watch his
awkwardness.I am very much surprised that Julia should condescend to
dance with him--a common newsboy."At first Tom thought he wouldn't dance, but Mrs.Rogers approaching
said:

"Tom, there's Jane Sheldon.Accordingly Tom found himself leading up a little girl of eight.There was no place except in the quadrille in which Dan and Julia Rogers
were to dance.Tom found himself one of the "sides.""Good-evening, Julia," he said, catching the eye of Miss Rogers."I am too late to be your partner.""Yes, but you see I am not left a wall-flower," said the young lady,
smiling.Mordaunt kindly relieved me of that apprehension.""You are fortunate," said Tom, sneering."I leave my partner to thank you for that compliment," said Julia,
determined not to gratify Tom by appearing to understand the sneer."There's no occasion," said Tom, rudely."I am glad of it," said Dan, "for I am so unused to compliments that I
am afraid I should answer awkwardly.""I can very well believe that," returned Tom, significantly.She looked offended rather for she felt that
rudeness to her partner reflected upon herself.But here the music struck up, and the quadrille began."Now for awkwardness," said Tom to himself, and he watched Dan closely.But, to his surprise, nothing could be neater or better modulated than
Dan's movements.Instead of hopping about, as Tom thought he would, he
was thoroughly graceful."Where could the fellow have learned to dance?"he asked himself, in
disappointment.Julia was gratified; for, to tell the truth, she too had not been
altogether without misgivings on the subject of Dan's dancing, and,
being herself an excellent dancer, she would have found it a little
disagreeable if Dan had proved awkward.The quadrille proceeded, and Tom was chagrined that the newsboy, as he
mentally termed Dan, had proved a better dancer than himself."Oh, well, it's easy to dance in a quadrille," he said to himself, by
way of consolation."He won't venture on any of the round dances."But as Dan was leading Julia to her seat he asked her hand in the next
polka, and was graciously accepted.He then bowed and left her, knowing that he ought not to monopolize the
young hostess.Although Tom had told Dan not to expect any attentions from him, he was
led by curiosity to accost our hero."It seems that newsboys dance," said he."But it was not in very good taste for you to engage Miss Rogers for the
first dance.""Somebody had to be prominent, or Miss Rogers would have been left to
dance by herself.""There are others who would have made more suitable partners for her.""I am sorry to have stood in your way."I shall have plenty of opportunities of dancing
with her, and you won't.I suppose she took pity on you, as you know no
other young lady here."Just then a pretty girl, beautifully dressed, approached Dan.Mordaunt," she said, offering her hand with a beaming
smile."Good-evening, Miss Carroll," said Dan.In a minute Dan was whirling round the room with the young lady, greatly
to Tom's amazement, for Edith Carroll was from a family of high social
standing, living on Murray Hill."How in the duse does Dan Mordaunt know that girl?"To Tom's further disappointment Dan danced as gracefully in the galop as
in the quadrille.When the galop was over, Dan promenaded with another young lady, whose
acquaintance he had made at dancing-school, and altogether seemed as
much at his ease as if he had been attending parties all his life.Tom managed to obtain Edith Carroll as a partner."I didn't know you were acquainted with Dan Mordaunt," he said."Oh, yes, I know him very well.Why I think he dances _beautifully_,
and so do all the girls.""How do the girls know how he dances?""Why he goes to our dancing-school.The professor says he is his best
pupil."That's fortunate for him," said Tom, with a sneer."Perhaps he may
become a dancing-master in time.""He would make a good one, but I don't think he's very likely to do
that.""It would be a good thing for him.He is as well-dressed as any
young gentleman here."This was true, and Tom resented it.He felt that Dan had no right to
dress well."He ought not to spend so much money on dress when he has his mother to
support," he said, provoked."It seems to me you take a great deal of interest in Mr.Mordaunt," said
the young beauty, pointedly."Oh, no; he can do as he likes for all me, but, of course, when a boy
in his position dresses as if he were rich one can't help noticing it.""I am sure he can't be very poor, or he could not attend Dodworth's
dancing-school.At any rate I like to dance with him, and I don't care
whether he's poor or rich."Presently Tom saw Dan dancing the polka with Julia Rogers, and with the
same grace that he had exhibited in the other dances.He felt jealous, for he fancied himself a favorite with Julia, because
their families being intimate, he saw a good deal of her.On the whole Tom was not enjoying the party.He did succeed, however, in
obtaining the privilege of escorting Julia to supper.Just in front of him was Dan, escorting a young lady from Fifth avenue.Mordaunt appears to be enjoying himself," said Julia Rogers."Yes, he has plenty of cheek," muttered Tom."Excuse me, Tom, but do you think such expressions suitable for such an
occasion as this?""I am sorry you don't like it, but I never saw a more forward or
presuming fellow than this Dan Mordaunt.""I beg you to keep your opinion to yourself," said Julia Rogers, with
dignity."I find he is a great favorite with all the young ladies here.I had no idea he knew so many of them."It seemed to him that all the girls were infatuated with
a common newsboy, while his vanity was hurt by finding himself quite
distanced in the race.About twelve o'clock the two boys met in the dressing-room."You seemed to enjoy yourself," said Tom, coldly."Yes, thanks to your kind attentions," answered Dan, with a smile."It
is pleasant to meet old friends, you know.By the way, I suppose we
shall meet at Miss Carroll's party.""So the young lady tells me," answered Dan, smiling."I suppose _you'll_ be giving a fashionable party next," said Tom, with
a sneer.But Dan's dreams were by no means sweet that night.When he reached home, it was to hear of a great and startling
misfortune.At half-past twelve Dan ascended the stairs to his mother's room.He had
promised to come in and tell her how he had enjoyed himself at the
party.He was in excellent spirits on account of the flattering
attentions he had received.It was in this frame of mind that he opened
the door.What was his surprise, even consternation, when his mother
advanced to meet him with tearful eyes and an expression of distress."Oh, Dan, I am so glad you have got home!""I am quite well, Dan; but Althea----"

And Mrs.You don't mean she is----"

He couldn't finish the sentence, but his mother divined what he meant.she said, "but she has disappeared--she has been
stolen."Mordaunt told what she knew, but that related only to the
particulars of the abduction.We are in a position to tell the reader
more, but it will be necessary to go back for a month, and transfer the
scene to another continent.In a spacious and handsomely furnished apartment at the West End of
London sat the lady who had placed Althea in charge of the Mordaunts.She was deep in thought, and that not of an agreeable nature."I fear," she said to herself, "that trouble awaits me.John Hartley,
whom I supposed to be in California, is certainly in London.I cannot be
mistaken in his face, and I certainly saw him in Hyde Park to-day.I don't know, but I fear he did.If so, he will not long
delay in making his appearance.Then I shall be persecuted, but I must
be firm.He shall not learn through me where Althea is.He is her
father, it is true, but he has forfeited all claim to her guardianship.A confirmed gambler and drunkard, he would soon waste her fortune,
bequeathed her by her poor mother.He can have no possible claim to it;
for, apart from his having had no hand in leaving it to her, he was
divorced from my poor sister before her death."At this point there was a knock at the door of the room.There entered a young servant-maid, who courtesied, and said:

"Mrs.Vernon, there is a gentleman who wishes to see you.""Yes, mum; he said his name was Bancroft."I know no one of that name," mused the lady."Well, Margaret,
you may show him up, and you may remain in the anteroom within call."Her eyes were fixed upon the door with natural curiosity, when her
visitor entered.Instantly her face flushed, and her eyes sparkled with anger."I see you know me, Harriet Vernon," he said."It is some time since we
met, is it not?I am charmed, I am sure, to see my sister-in-law looking
so well."He sank into a chair without waiting for an invitation."When did you change your name to Bancroft?"demanded the lady,
abruptly."Oh," he said, showing his teeth, "that was a little ruse.I feared you
would have no welcome for John Hartley, notwithstanding our near
relationship, and I was forced to sail under false colors.""It was quite in character," said Mrs.Vernon, coldly; "you were always
false.The slender tie that
connected us was broken when my sister obtained a divorce from you.""You think so, my lady," said the visitor, dropping his tone of mocking
badinage, and regarding her in a menacing manner, "but you were never
more mistaken.You may flatter yourself that you are rid of me, but you
flatter yourself in vain.""Do you come here to threaten me, John Hartley?""I come here to ask for my child."Where you cannot get at her," answered Mrs."Don't think to put me off in that way," he said, fiercely."Don't think to terrify me, John Hartley," said the lady,
contemptuously."I am not so easily alarmed as your poor wife."Hartley looked at her as if he would have assaulted her had he dared,
but she knew very well that he did not dare.He was a bully, but he was
a coward."You refuse, then, to tell me what you have done with my child?"A father has some rights, and the law will not permit
his child to be kept from him.""Does your anxiety to see Althea arise from parental affection?"she
asked, in a sarcastic tone.I have a right to the custody of my
child.""I suppose you have a right to waste her fortune also at the
gaming-table.""I have a right to act as my child's guardian," he retorted."Why should you not, John Hartley?You
ill-treated and abused her mother.Fortunately, she escaped from you before it was all gone.But you
shortened her life, and she did not long survive the separation.It was
her last request that I should care for her child--that I should, above
all, keep her out of your clutches.I made that promise, and I mean to
keep it.""You poisoned my wife's mind against me," he said."But for your cursed
interference we should never have separated.""You are right, perhaps, in your last statement.I certainly did urge my
sister to leave you.I obtained her consent to the application for a
divorce, but as to poisoning her mind against you, there was no need of
that.By your conduct and your treatment you destroyed her love and
forfeited her respect, and she saw the propriety of the course which I
recommended.""I didn't come here to be lectured.You can spare your invectives,
Harriet Vernon.I was not a model husband,
perhaps, but I was as good as the average.""If that is the case, Heaven help the woman who marries!""Or the man that marries a woman like you!""You are welcome to your opinion of me.I am entirely indifferent to
your good or bad opinion."I don't recognize your right to question me on this subject, but I
will answer you.He appeared to be occupied with
some thought.When he spoke it was in a more conciliatory tone."I don't doubt that she is in good hands," he said."I am sure you will
treat her kindly.Perhaps you are a better guardian than I. I am willing
to leave her in your hands, but I ought to have some compensation.""Althea has a hundred thousand dollars, yielding at least five thousand
dollars income.Probably her expenses are little more than one-tenth of
this sum.Give me half her income--say
three thousand dollars annually--and I will give you and her no further
trouble.""I thought that was the object of your visit," said Mrs."I was right in giving you no credit for parental affection.In regard
to your proposition, I cannot entertain it.You had one half of my
sister's fortune, and you spent it.You have no further claim on her
money.""Then I swear to you that I will be even with you.I will find the
child, and when I do you shall never see her again.""Margaret," she said, coldly, "will you show this gentleman out?""You are certainly very polite, Harriet Vernon," he said."You are bold,
too, for you are defying me, and that is dangerous.You had better
reconsider your determination, before it is too late.""It will never be too late; I can at any time buy you off," she said,
contemptuously."We shall see," he hissed, eying her malignantly.Vernon, when her visitor had been shown out,
"never admit that person again; I am always out to him.""I wonder who 'twas," she thought, curiously.John Hartley, when a young man, had wooed and won Althea's mother.Julia
Belmont was a beautiful and accomplished girl, an heiress in her own
right, and might have made her choice among at least a dozen suitors.That she should have accepted the hand of John Hartley, a banker's
clerk, reputed "fast," was surprising, but a woman's taste in such a
case is often hard to explain or justify.Vernon--strenuously objected to the match, and by so doing gained the
hatred of her future brother-in-law.Opposition proved ineffectual, and
Julia Belmont became Mrs.Her fortune amounted to two hundred
thousand dollars.The trustee and her sister succeeded in obtaining her
consent that half of this sum should be settled on herself, and her
issue, should she have any.John Hartley resigned his position
immediately after marriage, and declined to enter upon any business."Julia and I have enough to live upon.If I am
out of business I can devote myself more entirely to her."This reasoning satisfied his young wife, and for a time all went well.But Hartley joined a fashionable club, formed a taste for gambling,
indulged in copious libations, not unfrequently staggering home drunk,
to the acute sorrow of his wife, and then excesses soon led to
ill-treatment.The money, which he could spend in a few years, melted
away, and he tried to gain possession of the remainder of his wife's
property.But, meanwhile, Althea was born, and a consideration for her
child's welfare strengthened the wife in her firm refusal to accede to
this unreasonable demand."You shall have the income, John," she said--"I will keep none back; but
the principal must be kept for Althea.""You care more for the brat than you do for me," he muttered."I care for you both," she answered."You know how the money would go,
John."That meddling sister of yours has put you up to this," he said,
angrily.It is right, and I have decided for myself.""I feel that in refusing I am doing my duty by you.""It is a strange way--to oppose your husband's wishes.Women ought never
to be trusted with money--they don't know how to take care of it.""You are not the person to say this, John.In five years you have wasted
one hundred thousand dollars.""It was bad luck in investments," he replied.Investing money at the gaming-table is not
very profitable.""Do you mean to insult me, madam?""I am only telling the sad truth, John."She withdrew, flushed and indignant, for she had spirit enough to resent
this outrage, and he left the house in a furious rage.When Hartley found that there was no hope of carrying his point, all
restraint seemed removed.He plunged into worse excesses, and his
treatment became so bad that Mrs.Hartley consented to institute
proceedings for divorce.It was granted, and the child was given to her.When he returned his wife had died of
pneumonia, and her sister--Mrs.Vernon, now a widow--had assumed the
care of Althea.An attempt to gain possession of the child induced her
to find another guardian for the child.This was the way Althea had
come into the family of our young hero.Thus much, that the reader may understand the position of affairs, and
follow intelligently the future course of the story.When John Hartley left the presence of his sister-in-law, he muttered
maledictions upon her."I'll have the child yet, if only to spite her," he muttered, between
his teeth."I won't allow a jade to stand between me and my own flesh
and blood.I must think of some plan to circumvent her."He had absolutely no clew, and little money to assist
him in his quest.But Fortune, which does not always favor the brave,
but often helps the undeserving, came unexpectedly to his help.At an American banker's he ran across an old acquaintance--one who had
belonged to the same club as himself in years past."What are you doing here, Hartley?"By the way, I was reminded of you not long since.""I saw your child in Union Square, in New York.""Are you sure it was my
child?""Of course; I used to see it often, you know."Don't _you_ know where she lives?""No; her aunt is keeping the child from me.She was with a middle-aged lady, who evidently
was suspicious of me, for she did not bring out the child but once more,
and was clearly anxious when I took notice of her.""She was acting according to instructions, no doubt.""So do I. Why do they keep _you_ away from her?""Because she has money, and they wish to keep it in their hands," said
Hartley, plausibly.She is living
here in London, doubtless on my little girl's fortune."John Hartley knew that this was not true, for Mrs.Vernon was a rich
woman; but it suited his purpose to say so, and the statement was
believed by his acquaintance."This is bad treatment, Hartley," he said, in a tone of sympathy."What are you going to do about it?""Try to find out where the child is placed, and get possession of her."This information John Hartley felt to be of value.It narrowed his
search, and made success much less difficult.In order to obtain more definite information, he lay in wait for Mrs.Margaret at first repulsed him, but a sovereign judiciously slipped into
her hand convinced her that Hartley was quite the gentleman, and he had
no difficulty, by the promise of a future douceur, in obtaining her
co-operation."If it's no harm you mean my
missus----"

"Certainly not, but she is keeping my child from me.You can understand
a father's wish to see his child, my dear girl.""Indeed, I think it's cruel to keep her from you, sir.""Then look over your mistress' papers and try to obtain the street and
number where she is boarding in New York."Of course you have, sir," said the girl, readily.So it came about that the girl obtained Dan's address, and communicated
it to John Hartley.As soon as possible afterward Hartley sailed for New York."I'll secure the child," he said to himself, exultingly, "and then my
sweet sister-in-law must pay roundly for her if she wants her back."All which attested the devoted love of John Hartley for his child.ALTHEA'S ABDUCTION.Arrived in New York, John Hartley lost no time in ascertaining where Dan
and his mother lived.In order the better to watch without incurring
suspicion, he engaged by the week a room in a house opposite, which,
luckily for his purpose, happened to be for rent.It was a front window,
and furnished him with a post of observation from which he could see who
went in and out of the house opposite.Hartley soon learned that it would not be so easy as he had anticipated
to gain possession of the little girl.She never went out alone, but
always accompanied either by Dan or his mother.If, now, Althea were attending school, there
would be an opportunity to kidnap her.As it was, he was at his wits'
end.Mordaunt chanced to need some small
article necessary to the work upon which she was engaged.She might
indeed wait until the next day, but she was repairing a vest of Dan's,
which he would need to wear in the morning, and she did not like to
disappoint him."My child," she said, "I find I must go out a little while.""I want to buy some braid to bind Dan's vest.He will want to wear it in
the morning.""May I go with you, mamma?"You can be reading your picture-book till I come back.Mordaunt put on her street dress, and left the house in the
direction of Eighth avenue, where there was a cheap store at which she
often traded.No sooner did Hartley see her leave the house, as he could readily do,
for the night was light, than he hurried to Union Square, scarcely five
minutes distant, and hailed a cab-driver."Do you want a job, my man?""There is nothing wrong, sir, I hope."My child has been kidnapped during my absence in Europe."She is in the custody of some designing persons, who keep possession
of her on account of a fortune which she is to inherit.She does not
know me to be her father, we have been so long separated; but I feel
anxious to take her away from her treacherous guardians."I've got a little girl of my own, and I understand
your feelings.Fifteen minutes afterward the cab drew
up before Mrs.Brown's door, and Hartley, springing from it, rang the
bell.Brown was out, and a servant answered the
bell."A lady lives here with a little girl," he said, quickly."Precisely; and the little girl is named Althea."Mordaunt has been run over by a street-car, and been carried into
my house.She wishes the little girl to come at once to her.""I am afraid her leg is broken; but I can't wait.Will you bring the
little girl down at once?"Nancy went up stairs two steps at a time, and broke into Mrs."Put on your hat at once, Miss Althea," she said."But she said she was coming right back.""She's hurt, and she can't come, and she has sent for you."But how shall I know where to go, Nancy?""There's a kind gentleman at the door with a carriage.Your ma has been
taken to his home."I'm afraid mamma's been killed," she said."No, she hasn't, or how could she send for you?"This argument tended to reassure Althea, and she put on her little shawl
and hat, and hurried down stairs.Hartley was waiting for her impatiently, fearing that Mrs.Mordaunt
would come back sooner than was anticipated, and so interfere with the
fulfillment of his plans."So she calls this woman mamma," said Hartley to himself."Not very badly, but she cannot come home to-night.Get into the
carriage, and I will tell you about it as we are riding to her."He hurried the little girl into the carriage, and taking a seat beside
her, ordered the cabman to drive on.Sandra moved to the garden.He had before directed him to drive to the South Ferry."She was crossing the street," said Hartley, "when she got in the way of
a carriage and was thrown down and run over."The carriage was not a heavy one, luckily, and
she is only badly bruised.She will be all right in a few days."John Hartley was a trifle inconsistent in his stories, having told the
servant that Mrs.Mordaunt had been run over by a street-car; but in
truth he had forgotten the details of his first narrative, and had
modified it in the second telling.However, Nancy had failed to tell the
child precisely how Mrs.Mordaunt had been hurt, and she was not old
enough to be suspicious."Not far from here," answered Hartley, evasively."Then I shall soon see mamma.""No, not my own mamma, but I call her so."My papa is a very bad man."I thought this was some of Harriet Vernon's work," said Hartley to
himself."It seems like my amiable sister-in-law.She might have been in
better business than poisoning my child's mind against me."he asked, partly out of curiosity, but mainly
to occupy the child's mind, so that she might not be fully conscious of
the lapse of time."Oh, yes; Dan is a nice boy.He has gone to a party
to-night.""And he won't be home till late."I am glad of that," thought Hartley.He goes down town every morning, and he doesn't come home
till supper time."Hartley managed to continue his inquiries about Dan, but at last Althea
became restless."I don't see how mamma could have gone so far.""I see how it is," he said."The cab-driver lost the way, and that has
delayed us."Meanwhile they reached the South
Ferry, and Hartley began to consider in what way he could explain their
crossing the water.After a moment's thought Hartley took a flask from his pocket, into
which he had dropped a sleeping potion, and offered it to the child."Drink, my dear," he said; "it will do you good."It was a sweet wine and pleasant to the taste."It is a cordial," answered Hartley.I will ask mamma to get some."I feel very sleepy," said Althea, drowsily, the potion having already
begun to attack her.The innocent and unsuspecting child did as she was directed.She struggled against the increasing drowsiness, but in
vain."There will be no further trouble," thought Hartley."When she wakes up
it will be morning.It might have been supposed that some instinct of parental affection
would have made it disagreeable to this man to kidnap his own child by
such means, but John Hartley had never been troubled with a heart or
natural affections.He was supremely selfish, and surveyed the sleeping
child as coolly and indifferently as if he had never before set eyes
upon her.Two miles and a half beyond the South Ferry, in a thinly settled
outlying district of Brooklyn, stood a three-story brick house, shabby
and neglected in appearance, bearing upon a sign over the door the name


         DONOVAN'S

     WINES AND LIQUORS.It was the nightly resort of a set of rough and lawless men, many of
them thieves and social outlaws, who drank and smoked as they sat at
small tables in the sand-strewn bar-room.Hugh Donovan himself had served a term at Sing Sing for burglary, and
was suspected to be indirectly interested in the ventures of others
engaged in similar offenses, though he managed to avoid arrest.John Hartley ordered the hackman to stop.He sprang from the carriage,
and unceremoniously entered the bar-room.Donovan, a short, thickset man
with reddish whiskers, a beard of a week's growth, and but one
serviceable eye, sat in a wooden arm-chair, smoking a clay pipe.There
were two other men in the room, and a newsboy sat dozing on a settee.Donovan looked up, and his face assumed a look of surprise as he met the
glance of the visitor, whom he appeared to know.he asked, taking the pipe from
his mouth."I have a job for her and for you."I want her taken care of for a few
days or weeks.""Shure, the old woman isn't a very good protector for a gal.There are reasons--imperative reasons--why the girl
should be concealed for a time, and I can think of no other place than
this."I have little time for explanation, but I may
tell you that she has been kept from me by my enemies, who wanted to get
hold of her money.""Did the old lady leave it all away from you, then?The least I can expect is to be made guardian of my
own child.Is there no way of getting up stairs
except by passing through the bar-room?"Hartley, we can go up the back way.At the rear of the house was a stair-way, up which he
clambered, bearing the sleeping child in his arms.Donovan pushed the door open, and disclosed a dirty room, with his
better-half--a tall, gaunt woman--reclining in a rocking-chair,
evidently partially under the influence of liquor, as might be guessed
from a black bottle on a wooden table near by.She stared in astonishment at her husband's companions."Shure, Hugh, who is it you're bringin' here?""It's a child, old woman, that you're to have the care of.""Divil a bit do I want a child to worrit me.""Will I get the money, or Hugh?""You shall have half, Bridget," said her husband."I will pay ten dollars a week--half to you, and half to your husband,"
said Hartley."Here's a week's pay in advance," and he took out two
five-dollar bills, one of which was eagerly clutched by Mrs."I'll take care of her," said she, readily."Shure that's a quare name.You can call her any name you like," said
Hartley, indifferently."Perhaps you had better call her Katy, as there
may be a hue and cry after her, and that may divert suspicion."Donovan, and she opened the door of a small
room, in which was a single untidy bed.I gave her a sleeping potion--otherwise
she might have made a fuss, for she doesn't know me to be her father."Donovan, I depend upon your keeping her safe.It will not do
to let her escape, for she might find her way back to the people from
whom I have taken her.""Say nothing about me in connection with the matter, Donovan.I will
communicate with you from time to time.If the police are put on the
track, I depend on your sending her away to some other place of
security."I shall go back to New York at once.I must leave
you to pacify her as well as you can when she awakes."I'll trate her like my own child," said Mrs.Had Hartley been a devoted father, this assurance from the coarse,
red-faced woman would have been satisfactory, but he cared only for the
child as a means of replenishing his pockets, and gave himself no
trouble.The hackman was still waiting at the door."It's a queer place to leave a child," thought he, as his experienced
eye took in the features of the place."It appears to be a liquor
saloon.However, it is none of
my business."Driver, I am ready," said Hartley."Go over Fulton Ferry, and leave me at your stand in Union Square."Hartley threw himself back on the seat, and
gave himself up to pleasant self-congratulation."I think this will bring Harriet Vernon to terms," he said."She will
find that she can't stand between me and my child.If she will make it
worth my while, she shall have the child back, but I propose to see that
my interests are secured."The next morning Hartley stepped into an up-town hotel, and wrote a
letter to his sister-in-law in London, demanding that four thousand
dollars be sent him yearly, in quarterly payments, in consideration of
which he agreed to give up the child, and abstain from further
molestation.ALTHEA BECOMES KATY DONOVAN.The sleeping potion which had been administered to Althea kept her in
sound sleep till eight o'clock the next morning.When her eyes opened,
and she became conscious of her surroundings, she looked about her in
surprise.Then she sat up in bed and gazed wildly at the torn wall paper
and dirty and shabby furniture.The door opened, and the red and inflamed face of Mrs."I want mamma," answered the child, still more frightened."Shure I'm your ma, child.""No, you are not," said Althea.I sent you away to board, but
you've come home to live with your ma."You are a bad woman," returned the child,
ready to cry."It's a purty thing for a child to tell her ma she's lyin'.""Don't you go
on talkin' that way, but get right up, or you sha'n't have any
breakfast.""Oh, send me back to my mother and Dan!""Dress yourself, and I'll see about it," said Mrs.Althea looked for her clothes, but could not find them.In their place
she found a faded calico dress and some ragged undergarments, which had
once belonged to a daughter of Mrs."Those clothes are not mine," said Althea."I had a pretty pink dress and a nice new skirt.These was the clothes you took off last night,"
said Mrs."I won't put this dress on," said the child, indignantly."Then you'll have to lay abed all day, and won't get nothing to eat,"
said the woman."Shure you're a quare child to ask your own mother's name."That's a quare name intirely.I'm afraid
you're gone crazy, Katy."Was it possible that she could be Katy Donovan,
and that this red-faced woman was her mother?She began to doubt her own
identity.She could not remember this woman, but was it possible that
there was any connection between them?"I used to live in New York with Mamma Mordaunt.""Well, you're livin' in Brooklyn now with Mamma Donovan.""Shure I shouldn't have sent you away from me to have you come home and
deny your own mother.""Will you let me go to New York and see Mamma Mordaunt?"asked Althea,
after a pause."If you're a good girl, perhaps I will.Now get up, and I'll give you
some breakfast."With a shudder of dislike Althea arrayed herself in the dirty garments
of the real Katy Donovan, and looked at her image in the cracked mirror
with a disgust which she could not repress.Hartley had suggested that her own garments should be taken away in
order to make her escape less feasible.She opened the door, and entered the room in which Mrs.Donovan had set
the table for breakfast.As she came in at one door, Hugh Donovan entered at another."Come here, little gal," he said, with a grin.Althea looked at him with real terror.Certainly Hugh Donovan was not a
man to attract a child.Althea at once thought of an ogre whom Dan had described to her in a
fairy story, and half fancied that she was in the power of such a
creature."I don't want to," said the child, trembling."Go to your father, Katy," said Mrs.Althea shuddered at the idea, and she gazed as if
fascinated at his one eye."Yes, come to your pa," said Donovan, jeeringly."I like little
gals--'specially when they're my own.""Yes, you be, and don't you deny it.The little girl began to cry in nervous terror, and Donovan laughed,
thinking it a good joke."Well, it'll do after breakfast," he said."Sit up, child, and we'll see
what the ould woman has got for us."Donovan did not excel as a cook, but Althea managed to eat a little
bread and butter, for neither of which articles the lady of the house
was responsible.When the meal was over she said:

"Now, will you take me back to New York?""You are not going back at all," said Hugh."You are our little girl,
and you are going to live with us."Althea looked from one to the other in terror.Was it possible they
could be in earnest?She was forced to believe it, and was overwhelmed
at the prospect.She burst into a tempest of sobs.Hugh Donovan's face darkened, and his anger was kindled."Stop it now, if you know what's best for yourself!"Althea was terrified, but she could not at once control her emotion.Her husband took it,
and brandished it menacingly."Yes," said Althea, trembling, stopping short, as if fascinated."Then you'll feel it if you don't stop your howlin'."Althea gazed at him horror-stricken."I thought you'd come to your senses," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction."Kape her safe, old woman, till she knows how to behave."In silent misery the little girl sat down and watched Mrs.Donovan as
she cleared away the table, and washed the dishes.It was dull and
hopeless work for her.Mordaunt and Dan,
and wished she could be with them again.The thought so saddened her that she burst into a low moan, which
at once drew the attention of Mrs."I can't help it," moaned Althea.See here, now," and the woman displayed the whip
with which her husband had threatened the child."I'll give ye something
to cry for.""Oh, don't--don't beat me!""Ye want to run away," said Mrs.I mean I won't unless you let me."asked Althea, with her little heart
sinking at the thought."No, Katy, you may go wid me when I go to the market," answered Mrs."Shure, if you'll be a good gal, I'll give you all the pleasure
I can."Althea waited half an hour, and then was provided with a ragged
sun-bonnet, with which, concealing her sad face, she emerged from the
house, and walked to a small market, where Mrs.Donovan obtained her
supplies for dinner.Troubled as she was, Althea looked about her with a child's curiosity on
her way through the strange streets.It served to divert her from her
sorrow."Shure it's my little Katy," said the woman, with a significant wink
which prevented further questioning.Althea wished to deny this, but she did not dare to.She had become
afraid of her new guardians.She felt
sure that he would take her away from these wicked people, but how was
Dan to know where she was.The poor child's lips quivered, and she could
hardly refrain from crying.It was so late when Dan heard of Althea's disappearance that he felt it
necessary to wait till morning before taking any steps toward her
recovery."I'll find her, mother," he said, confidently."Do not lie awake
thinking of her, for it won't do any good."I didn't know how much I loved the dear child
till I lost her.""I am not so hopeful as you, Dan.I fear that I shall never see her
again."Now, mother, I am going to bed, but I shall be up
bright and early in the morning, and then to work.""You won't have any time, Dan.Rogers,
telling him my reasons, and he will be sure not to object.If Althea is
to be found, I will find her within a week."Mordaunt some courage, but she could not
feel as sanguine of success as Dan.In the morning Dan sought out Nancy, and took down her account of how
the little girl had been spirited away."So she went away in a carriage, Nancy?""Can you tell me what sort of a looking man it was that took her away?"I was struck dumb, you see, wid hearing how your
mother broke her leg, and I didn't think to look at him sharp.""You can tell if he was an old man or a young one."He was betwixt and betwane."Now, what kind of a carriage was it?""Jist a hack like them at the square.""No; shure they all look alike to me."Dan made more inquiries, but elicited nothing further that was likely to
be of service to him.After a little reflection he decided to go to Union Square and
interview some of the drivers waiting for passengers there.He did so, but the driver who had actually been employed by Hartley was
absent, and he learned nothing.One driver, however, remembered carrying
a gentleman and child to a house on Twenty-seventh street, between
Eighth and Ninth avenues.Dan thought the clew of sufficient importance to be followed up.His
courage rose when, on inquiring at the house mentioned, he learned that
a child had actually been brought there."May I see the child, madam?""If you like," answered the lady, in surprise.She appeared in a short time with a boy of about Althea's age."It is a little girl I am inquiring after," he said."You would
have saved me some trouble.""I begin to think I am not as good a detective as I thought," said Dan
to himself."I am on a false scent, that is sure."When he had been asking questions of the cab-drivers he had not been
unobserved.John Hartley, who knew Dan by sight, laughed in his sleeve
as he noted our hero's inquiries."You may be a smart boy, my lad," he said to himself, "but I don't think
you'll find the child.I have a great mind to give you a hint."He approached Dan, and observed, in a friendly way:

"Are you in search of your little sister?""Yes, sir," returned Dan, eagerly."I am not sure, but possibly I may.I occupy a room directly opposite
the house in which you board.""Did you see Althea carried away?""Yes; I was sitting at my window when I saw a hack stop at your door.The door-bell was rung by a man who descended from the hack, and shortly
afterward your sister came out, and was put into the carriage.""What was the man's appearance, sir?"So much the better," thought Hartley, with satisfaction."He was a little taller than myself, I should say," he answered, "and I
believe his hair was brown"--Hartley's was black."I am sorry I can't
remember more particularly."I came down into the street before the cab
drove away, and I heard the gentleman referred to say, in a low voice,
'Drive to Harlem.'""Thank you, sir," said Dan, gratefully."That puts me on the right
track."I wish I could tell you more," said Hartley, with a queer smile."If you find your little sister, I should be glad if you would let me
know," continued Hartley, chuckling inwardly."I will, sir, if you will let me know your name and address.""My name is John Franklin, and I live in the house directly opposite
yours, No."All right, sir; I will note it down."John Hartley looked after Dan with a smile."My dear young friend," he said to himself, "it goes to my heart to
deceive you, you are so innocent and confiding.I wish you much joy of
your search in Harlem.I think it will be some time before I receive
intelligence of your success.Still I will keep my room here, and look
after you a little.I am really afraid your business will suffer while
you are wandering about."John Hartley had already written to London, and he was prepared to wait
three weeks or more for an answer to his proposition.Meanwhile he had
one source of uneasiness.His funds were getting low, and unless Harriet
Vernon responded favorably to his proposal, he was liable to be
seriously embarrassed.He had on previous similar occasions had recourse
to the gaming-table, but Fortune did not always decide in his favor.He
did not dare to hazard the small sum he had on hand, lest want of
success should imperil the bold scheme for obtaining an income at his
child's expense.At this critical point in his fortunes he fell in with a Western
adventurer, who, by a sort of freemasonry, recognizing Hartley's want of
character, cautiously sounded him as to becoming a partner in a
hazardous but probably profitable enterprise.It was to procure some
genuine certificates of stock in a Western railway for a small number of
shares, say five or ten, and raise them ingeniously to fifty and a
hundred, and then pledge them as collateral in Wall street for a
corresponding sum of money.John Hartley, if an honest man, would have indignantly declined the
overtures; but he was not endowed with Roman virtue.He made a cautious
investigation to ascertain how great was the danger of detection, and
how well the enterprise would pay.The answer to the second question was
so satisfactory that he made up his mind to run the necessary risk.Blake and he came to a definite understanding, and matters were put in
train.Certificates were readily obtained, and by the help of a skillful
accomplice, who did the work for a specified sum, were ingeniously
raised tenfold.Then Blake, assuming the dress and manners of a thriving business man
from Syracuse, negotiated a loan, pledging the raised certificate as
collateral.The private banker put it away among his securities without
a doubt or suspicion, and Blake and Hartley divided a thousand dollars
between them.John Hartley was very much elated by his success.The pecuniary
assistance came just in the nick of time, when his purse was very low."It's a good thing to have more than one string to your bow," he
thought."Not but that my little game in getting hold of the child is
likely to pay well.Harriet Vernon will find that I have the whip-hand
of her.She must come to my terms, sooner or later."At that very moment Harriet Vernon was embarking at Liverpool on a
Cunard steamer.She had received the letter of her brother-in-law, and
decided to answer it in person.DAN DISGUISES HIMSELF.For several days Dan strolled about Harlem, using his eyes to good
advantage.As a pretext he carried with him a few morning papers for
sale.Armed with these he entered shops and saloons without exciting
surprise or suspicion.But he discovered not a trace of the lost girl.One day, as he was riding home in the Third avenue cars, there flashed
upon his mind a conviction that he was on a wrong scent."Is it probable that the man who carried away Althea would give the
right direction so that it could be overheard by a third party?No; it
was probably meant as a blind, and I have been just fool enough to fall
into the trap."Before the day was over they were wholly opened.He met John Hartley on
Broadway toward the close of the afternoon."Well, have you heard anything of your sister?"he asked, with an
appearance of interest."Keep on, you will find her in time."After they parted, Dan, happening to look back, detected a mocking
glance in the face of his questioner, and a new discovery flashed upon
him.He had sent him to Harlem,
purposely misleading him."Can he have had anything to do
with the abduction of Althea?"This was a question which he could not satisfactorily answer, but he
resolved to watch Hartley, and follow him wherever he went, in the hope
of obtaining some clew.Of course he must assume some disguise, as
Hartley must not recognize him.He hired a room on East Fourth street for a week, and then sought an
Italian boy to whom he had occasionally given a few pennies, and with
some difficulty (for Giovanni knew but little English, and he no
Italian) proposed that the Italian should teach him to sing and play
"Viva Garibaldi."Dan could play a little on the violin, and soon
qualified himself for his new business.At a second-hand shop on Chatham street he picked up a suit of tattered
velvet, obtained a liquid with which to stain his skin to a dark brown,
and then started out as an Italian street musician.His masquerade suit
he kept in his room at East Fourth street, changing therefrom his street
dress morning and evening.When in full masquerade he for the first time
sang and played, Giovanni clapped his hands with delight.Giovanni was puzzled to understand why Dan took so much pains to enter
upon a hard and unprofitable profession, but Dan did not enlighten him
as to his motive.He thought it most prudent to keep his secret, even from his mother.One
day he met her on the sidewalk, and began to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Mordaunt listened without a suspicion that it was her own son, and
gave him two pennies, which he acknowledged by a low bow, and "Grazia,
signora.""I hope his padrone does not beat him," said Mrs."I hear these poor boys are much abused.I wonder if I can make him
understand?"Si, signora, padrone," answered Dan."It is no use; he doesn't understand English.Here is some more money
for you," and she handed him a five-cent coin."Its a wise mother that knows her own child," thought Dan.Hartley boarded a University Place car, and Dan jumped on also.Italian boys so seldom ride that the conductor eyed Dan with some
suspicion."I thought you might be expecting to ride for nothing," said the
conductor."Seems to me you're flush for an Italian fiddler.""And I don't understand your lingo."A charitable lady inside the car chanced to see Dan, and it occurred to
her that she would do him a service."If the conductor doesn't object, you may sing while we are on our way."You can sing and play," said the conductor, good-naturedly.Dan was not at all desirous of doing this, for Hartley sat only three
feet from him, and he feared he might recognize him, but it would not be
in character to refuse, so he began, and sang his one air, playing an
accompaniment.Several of the passengers handed him small coins, among
them Hartley."I can't agree with you, ma'am," said Hartley."I would rather give him
money to stop.""His voice strikes me as very rich, and the Italian is such a beautiful
language.""I have heard a good deal better performers even among the street boys,"
said Hartley."So have I," said Dan to himself."He doesn't suspect me; I am glad of
that."Hartley remained in the car till it reached the Astor House, and so, of
course, did Dan.In fact, Hartley was on his way to Brooklyn to pay
another installment to the guardians of the little girl whom he had
carried off.Hartley kept on his way to Fulton Ferry, Dan following at a prudent
distance.Had Hartley looked back, he would have suspected nothing, for he had not
penetrated Dan's disguise, and would therefore have been quite at a loss
to understand any connection between the street musician and himself.They both boarded the same ferry-boat, and landed in Brooklyn together.At this moment Hartley turned round, and his glance fell upon Dan."Si, signor," answered Dan, bowing deferentially."I sing, I play," said our hero."It is lucky you don't, or you might not like my compliment.""Shall I sing 'Viva Garibaldi?'"Here, take
this money, and don't sing.""Si, signor," answered Dan, assuming a look of bewilderment.Hartley prepared to board a car, which was not yet ready to start.Dan
rapidly decided that it would not do for him to follow Hartley any
farther.Looking about him, his eye fell
on a bright-looking newsboy of about twelve."Do you want to make some money, Johnny?""Did you speak to me, Garibaldi?""Yes, but I am no Italian," said Dan, rapidly."I am on the track of
that man, but he suspects me.I will give you a dollar if you will jump
on the car and find out where he goes."Pay your expenses out of it, and I will pay you back when you
report to me."The newsboy ran, jumped on the car, and it moved on."It is the best thing I could do," thought Dan."I hope the boy is
sharp, and won't lose sight of him.I feel sure that he had something
to do with carrying off poor little Althea."For two hours Dan lingered near the ferry, playing occasionally by way
of filling up the time.It seemed to be a good location, for he received
from fifty to sixty cents from passers-by."When hard times come," thought Dan, "I shall know what to do.I will
become an Italian street singer."After two hours the newsboy jumped off an incoming car, and approached
Dan.DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.Dan's eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan."Now tell me," he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they
would not be overheard."You've made a fortun' by fiddling, you have," said the newsboy, in
surprise.The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan's.Hartley went in, and he directly afterward."Perhaps he only went in for a drink," suggested Dan, uneasily."No, he didn't call for nothing to drink.I saw him take out some money
and give to the man and the woman."I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn't.Then I
sat down for a minute, makin' believe I was tired.They looked at me,
but I didn't appear to be noticin' 'em, and they let me stay.""Did you see anything of a little girl?""Yes, there was a little gal came in.Donovan's daughter, he feared, not the
child he was seeking.He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan's
hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea."Did you hear the little girl say anything?""Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.""You needn't tell me any more."Have you found out what you want to know?"Have you anything to do for the next two hours?""Then I'll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me.I think I
could find it myself, but I can't take any chances.And don't say a word
about what you have seen.""She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.""Then I'd be willing to help you for nothing.I've got a little sister
about her size.If anybody stole her, I'd mash him!"The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out."That's the place," said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan's, only a few
rods away.You'd better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and
that would lead them to suspect me.If I do, it'll be through your help."He stopped in the street, and began
to sing "Viva Garibaldi."Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a couple of men.One
of them handed him a three-cent piece."Grazio, signor," said Dan, pulling off his hat."What part of Italy do you come from?""Si, signor, I come from Italy," answered Dan, not considering it
prudent to understand too well."His hair doesn't look like that of most Italians."I'd know him for an Italian boy anywhere."At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his
violin under his arm, entered.One was an Irishman, the other a German.Both
had evidently drank more than was good for them.Dan looked in vain for
Althea."Well, boy, what do you want?"asked Dan, uncertain whether he was talking
as an Italian boy might be expected to."No; I don't want to hear any fiddle-scraping.""Shure, let him play a little, Mister Donovan," said the Irishman."Just as you like," said Donovan, carelessly, "only I have no money for
him."Dan struck up his one tune--Viva Garibaldi--but the Irishman did not
seem to care for that."Oh, bother ould Garibaldi!"Accordingly he tried to play an air popular enough at the time, but
made bad work of it.exclaimed the German, who had a better musical ear
than the Irishman."Here, lend me your fiddle, boy."He took the violin, and in spite of his inebriety, managed to play a
German air upon it."Shure you bate the boy at his own trade," said the Irishman.The German indicated his preference, and the Irishman called for whisky."I no drink," answered our hero, shaking his head."Shure you're an Italian wonder, and it's Barnum ought to hire you.""Then you're a haythen," said Pat Moriarty.He gulped down the whisky, and finding it more convenient to sit than to
stand, fell back upon a settee."I wish Althea would come in," thought Dan.At that moment a heavy fall was heard in the room overhead, and a
child's shrill scream directly afterward."Something's happened to my wife," muttered Donovan.He hurried up stairs, and the German followed.This gave Dan an excuse
for running up, too.Donovan had been drinking more copiously than usual.While in this
condition she imprudently got upon a chair to reach a pitcher from an
upper shelf.Her footing was uncertain, and she fell over, pitcher in
hand, the chair sharing in the downfall.When her husband entered the room she was lying flat on her back,
grasping the handle of the pitcher, her eyes closed, and her breathing
stertorious.Althea, alarmed, stood over her, crying and screaming."The old woman's taken too much," said Donovan.he
shouted, leaning over his matrimonial partner."Ain't you ashamed of
yourself, now?"Donovan opened her eyes, and stared at him vacantly."On your back, you old fool, where you deserve to be.""It's the whisky," murmured the fallen lady.Why can't you drink dacent like me?Shure it's a purty
example you're settin' to the child.Ain't you ashamed to lie here in a
hape before them gintlemen?"This called Althea's attention to the German and Dan.In spite of Dan's
disguise, she recognized him with a cry of joy.she exclaimed, dashing past
Donovan, and clasping her arms round the supposed Italian.exclaimed Donovan, looking at the two in surprise."Oh, it's my brother Dan," exclaimed Althea."You'll take me away, won't
you, Dan?"So that's your game, my young chicken, is it?"demanded Donovan,
seizing our hero roughly by the shoulder.Then pulling off Dan's hat, he
added: "You're no more Italian than I am."Dan saw that it would be useless to keep up the deceit any longer.He
looked Donovan full in the face, and said, firmly:

"You are right, Mr.Donovan, I have come here for my sister."Donovan's red face turned fairly purple with rage.Why, I could crush you with my little
finger.""I have not insulted you," said Dan."I don't know anything about your sister."That little girl is my adopted sister," said Dan, pointing to Althea."Ask her if she doesn't know me.""That is my daughter, Katy Donovan," said the saloon keeper."No, I am not," said Althea, beginning to cry."I want to go away with
my brother Dan."Donovan," (by
this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), "is
not this our little Katy?""You see, young man, you're mistaken.You can leave," and Donovan waved
his hand triumphantly.I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since
living with my mother."said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his
fingers."I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house," continued
Dan."The same man has been here to-day," added Dan.How much does he pay you for taking
care of the girl?""I can't waste my time
talkin' wid you."No, I won't, unless Althea goes with me," said Dan, firmly.We'll see about that," and Donovan, making a rush,
seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero's
resistance."I'll tache you to come here insultin' your betters!"Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match
for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance.The Irishman
already referred to was still upon the settee.he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his
burden."What's the lad been doin'?""What's he been doin', is it?He's been insultin' me to my face--that's
what the Donovans won't stand."Don't trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you.Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him
credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar
below.There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and
descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy
who had offended him.He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good
luck falling on his feet."That's the best place for you, you young meddler!""You'll
find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy.I won't charge you
no rint, and that's an object in these hard times--eh, Barney?""To be sure it is," said Barney; "but all the same, Donovan, I'd rather
pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!""He hasn't the choice," said Donovan triumphantly."What's it all about now, Donovan?""He wanted to shtale my Katy," said Donovan.asked Donovan, not caring to go
into particulars.Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was
hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries.DAN DISCOMFITS THE DONOVANS.Dan found himself at first bewildered and confused by his sudden descent
into the cellar.As his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, he was
able to get an idea of his surroundings.It was a common cellar with an
earthen floor.Ranged along one side was a row of kegs, some containing
whisky, others empty.Besides, there were a few boxes and odds and ends
which had been placed here to get them out of the way."Not a very cheerful-looking place," thought Dan, "though I do get it
rent free."He sat down on a box, and began to consider his position.The walls were solid, and although there was a narrow
window, consisting of a row of single panes, it was at the top of the
cellar, and not easily accessible.He might indeed reach it by the
ladder, but he would have to break the glass and crawl through, a mode
of escape likely to be attended by personal risk."No, that won't do," thought Dan."At any rate, I won't try it till
other things fail."Meanwhile Donovan, in the bar-room above, was in high good humor.He
felt that he had done a sharp thing, and more than once chuckled as he
thought of his prisoner below.Indeed he could not forbear, after about
half an hour, lifting the trap and calling down stairs:

"Hallo, there!""You're an impudent jackanapes!""You'll
get enough of it before you're through.""So will you," answered Dan, boldly."I'll take the risk," chuckled Donovan."Do you know what you remind me
of?""You're like a rat in a trap.""Not exactly," answered Dan, as a bright thought dawned upon him."Because a rat can do no harm, and I can."It occurred to Donovan that Dan might have some matches in his pocket,
and was momentarily alarmed at the thought that our hero might set the
house on fire."If you had," said the saloon-keeper, relieved, "it would do you no good
to set a fire."I don't mean to set the house on fire," said Dan, composedly.returned Dan, rising from his seat on the box.asked Donovan, following with his glance the
boy's motion."I'm going to take the spigot out of them
whisky-kegs, and let the whisky run out on the floor."exclaimed the saloon-keeper, now thoroughly
frightened.As he spoke Dan dextrously pulled the spigot from a keg, and Donovan, to
his dismay, heard the precious liquid--precious in his eyes--pouring out
upon the floor.With an exertion he raised the trap-door, hastily descended the ladder,
and rushed to the keg to replace the spigot.Meanwhile Dan ran up the ladder, pulled it after him, and made his late
jailer a captive."Put down the ladder, you young rascal!"roared Donovan, when, turning
from his work, he saw how the tables had been turned."It wouldn't be convenient just yet," answered Dan, coolly.He shut the trap-door, hastily lugged the ladder to the rear of the
house (unobserved, for there were no customers present), then dashed up
stairs and beckoned to Althea to follow him.Donovan was stupefied by liquor.Putting on her things, the little girl hastily and gladly obeyed.As they passed through the saloon, Donovan's execrations and shouts were
heard proceeding from the cellar."Never you mind, Althea," said Dan.The two children hurried to the nearest horse-car, which luckily came up
at the moment, and jumped on board.Dan looked back with a smile at the saloon, saying to himself:

"I rather think, Mr.Donovan, you've found your match this time.I hope
you'll enjoy the cellar as much as I did."In about an hour and a half Dan, holding Althea by the hand,
triumphantly led her into his mother's presence."I've brought her back, mother," he said."Oh, my dear, dear little girl!""I
thought I should never, never see you again.But we will not wait to hear a twice-told tale.Rather let us return to
Donovan, where the unhappy proprietor is still a captive in his own
cellar.Here he remained till his cries attracted the attention of a
wondering customer, who finally lifted the trap-door."What are you doin' down there?""Put down the ladder and let me up first of all."It was a considerable time before the ladder was found.Then the
saloon-keeper emerged from his prison in a very bad humor."I wish I had left you there," said the customer, with justifiable
indignation."This is your gratitude for my trouble, is it?""Excuse me, but I'm so mad with that cursed boy."Come, that's talking," said the placated customer."Wait a minute," said Donovan, a sudden fear possessing him.He rushed up stairs and looked for Althea.His wife was lying on the floor, breathing heavily, but the little girl
was gone.exclaimed Donovan,
sinking into a chair.Then, in a blind fury with the wife who didn't prevent the little girl's
recapture, he seized a pail of water and emptied it over the face of the
prostrate woman.Donovan came to, and berated her husband furiously."Serves you right, you jade!"It was certainly an unlucky day for the Donovans.After calling at Donovan's, on the day when Dan recovered Althea, John
Hartley crossed the Courtlandt street ferry, and took a train to
Philadelphia with Blake, his accomplice in the forged certificates.The
two confederates had raised some Pennsylvania railway certificates,
which they proposed to put on the Philadelphia market.They spent several days in the Quaker City, and thus Hartley heard
nothing of the child's escape.Donovan did not see fit to inform him, as this would stop the weekly
remittance for the child's board, and, moreover, draw Hartley's
indignation down upon his head.One day, in a copy of the _New York Herald_, which he purchased at the
news-stand in the Continental Hotel, Hartley observed the arrival of
Harriet Vernon at the Fifth Avenue Hotel."I thought she would come," he said to himself, with a smile."I have
her in my power at last.She must submit to my terms, or lose sight of
the child altogether.""Blake," he said, aloud, "I must take the first train to New York.""On the contrary, I see a chance of making a good haul."Vernon sat in her room at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel.A servant brought up a card bearing the name of John
Hartley."He is prompt," she said to herself, with a smile."Probably he has not
heard of Althea's escape from the den to which he carried her.I will
humor him, in that case, and draw him out.""I will see the gentleman in the parlor," she said.Five minutes later she entered the ladies' parlor.Hartley rose to
receive her with a smile of conscious power, which told Harriet Vernon
that he was ignorant of the miscarriage of his plans."I heard of your _unexpected_ arrival, Mrs.Vernon," he commenced, "and
have called to pay my respects.""Your motive is appreciated, John Hartley," she said, coldly."That's pleasant," he said, mockingly."May I beg to apologize for
constraining you to cross the Atlantic?""Don't apologize; you have merely acted out your nature.""Probably that is not meant to be complimentary.However, it can't be
helped.""I suppose you have something to say to me, John Hartley," said Mrs.I wrote you that I had ferreted out your cunningly
devised place of concealment for my daughter."She seemed very cool and composed,
whereas he expected she would be angry and disturbed."We may as well come to business at once," he said."If you wish to
recover the charge of your ward, you must accede to my terms.""They are expressed in my letter to you.You must agree to pay me a
thousand dollars each quarter.""It strikes me you are exorbitant in your demands."At any rate, the money won't come out of you.It will
come from my daughter's income.""So you would rob your daughter, John Hartley?"Is
she to live in luxury, and with thousands to spare, while I, her only
living parent, wander penniless and homeless about the world.""I might sympathize with you, if I did not know how you have misused the
gifts of fortune, and embittered the existence of my poor sister.As it
is, it only disgusts me.""I don't want you sympathy, Harriet Vernon," he said, roughly."I want
four thousand dollars a year.""Suppose I decline to let you have it?""Then you must take the consequences," he said, quickly."That you and Althea will be forever separated.He looked at her intently to see the effect of his threat.Harriet Vernon was as cool and imperturbable as ever."Have you been in New York for a week past?"she asked, as he thought,
irrelevantly."Because you don't appear to know what has happened."As for me, I bid you good-evening.""I mean, John Hartley, that you are not as shrewd as you imagine.I mean
that a boy has foiled you; and while you were doubtless laughing at his
simplicity, he has proved more than a match for you.You have no claim
upon me, and I must decline your disinterested proposal."She left the room, leaving him crest-fallen and stupefied.He started for Brooklyn immediately, and toward eleven o'clock entered
the saloon at Donovan's."She's gone," he cried, "but I couldn't help it, Mr.On my
honor, I couldn't."The story was told, Donovan ending by invoking curses upon the boy who
had played such a trick upon him."I am ashamed of you, for
allowing a boy to get the best of you.""That boy's a fox," said Donovan."He's a match for the old one, he is.I'd like to break his neck for him."I may get hold of the girl again," mused Hartley, as
he rose to go."If I do, I won't put her in charge of such a
dunderhead."He left Donovan's and returned to New York, but he had hardly left the
Fulton ferry-boat when he was tapped on the shoulder by an officer."A little financial irregularity, as they call it in Wall street.You
may know something about some raised railroad certificates!"The morning papers contained an account of John Hartley's arrest, and
the crime with which he was charged.Harriet Vernon read it at the breakfast-table with an interest which may
be imagined."I don't like to rejoice in any man's misfortune," she said to herself,
"but now I can have a few years of peace.My precious brother-in-law
will doubtless pass the next few years in enforced seclusion, and I can
have a settled home."Directly after breakfast, she set out for the humble home of her niece.She found all at home, for Dan was not to go back to business till
Monday."Well, my good friend," she said, "I have news for you.""Good news, I hope," said Dan.Henceforth I can have Althea with me.The obstacle that
separated us is removed."Mordaunt's countenance fell, and Dan looked sober.It was plain
that Althea was to be taken from them, and they had learned to love her."I am very glad," faltered Mrs."You don't look glad," returned Mrs."You see we don't like to part with Althea," explained Dan, who
understood his mother's feelings."Who said you were to part with the child?""I thought you meant to take her from us."Your mistake is a natural one, for I have not told you my
plans.I mean to take a house up town, install Mrs.Mordaunt as my
housekeeper and friend, and adopt this young man (indicating Dan),
provided he has no objection."I have plenty of money, and no one to care for, or to
care for me.I have taken a fancy to you all, and I am quite sure that
we can all live happily together.Althea is my niece, and you, Dan, may
call me aunt, too, if you like.Dan offered her his hand in a frank, cordial way, which she liked."So it is settled, then," she said, in a pleased voice."I ought to warn
you," she added, "that I have the reputation of being ill-tempered.You
may get tired of living with me.""We'll take the risk," said Dan, smiling.Vernon, whose habit it was to act promptly, engaged a house on
Madison avenue, furnished it without regard to expense, and in less than
a fortnight, installed her friends in it.Then she had a talk with Dan
about his plans."Do you wish to remain in your place," she asked, "or would you like to
obtain a better education first?""To obtain an education," said Dan, promptly."Then give notice to your employer of your intention."Vernon in a second interview informed him that besides defraying
his school expenses, she should give him an allowance of fifty dollars a
month for his own personal needs."May I give a part of it to my mother?""You don't ask why I refuse," she said."I suppose you have a good reason," said Dan, dubiously."My reason is that I shall pay your mother double this sum.Unless she
is very extravagant it ought to be enough to defray her expenses."exclaimed Dan, in fresh
astonishment.All these important changes in the position of the Mordaunts were
unknown to their old friends, who, since their loss of property, had
given them the cold shoulder.One day Tom Carver, in passing the house, saw Dan coming down the steps
quite as handsomely dressed as himself."I didn't know what else could carry you to such a house.""Oh, that's easily explained," said Dan."You don't mean to say she boards there?"asked Tom, in a more deferential tone.At any rate she gives me a handsome allowance.""And you don't have anything to do?""Why, my father only
allows me three dollars a week."I don't need as much as my aunt allows me.""I say, Dan," said Tom, in the most friendly terms, "I'm awfully hard
up."Yes," said Dan, secretly amused with the change in Tom's manner.said Tom, linking his arm in Dan's."I'm very glad you're rich again."Thank you," said Dan, smiling, "but I'm afraid you have forgotten
something.""You know I used to be a newsboy in front of the Astor House.""And you might not care to associate with a newsboy.""Well, you are all right now," said Tom, magnanimously."You didn't always think so, Tom.""I always thought you were a gentleman, Dan."I suppose it's the way of the world," thought Dan."It is lucky that
there are some true friends who stick by us through thick and thin."Mordaunt had an experience similar to Dan's.Her old acquaintances,
who, during her poverty never seemed to recognize her when they met,
gradually awoke to the consciousness of her continued existence, and
left cards.She received them politely, but rated their professions of
friendship at their true value.They had not been "friends in need," and
she could not count them "friends indeed."Six years rolled by, bringing with them many changes.The little family
on Madison avenue kept together.She had a hearty love for young people, and enjoyed the growth and
development of her niece Althea, and Dan, whom she called her nephew and
loved no less.He completed his preparation for college, and
graduated with high honors.He is no less frank, handsome, and
self-reliant than when as a boy he sold papers in front of the Astor
House for his mother's support.He looks forward to a business life, and
has accepted an invitation to go abroad to buy goods in London and Paris
for his old firm.He was, in fact, preparing to go when a mysterious
letter was put in his hands.It ran thus:


     "MR.DANIEL MORDAUNT:--I shall take it as a great favor if you will
     come to the St.Nicholas Hotel this evening, and inquire for me.I
     am sick, or I would not trouble you.I have to speak
     to you on a matter of great importance."I don't know of any one of that name."I cannot think of any one," said Mrs."I hope you won't go,
Dan," she added, anxiously; "it may be a trap laid by a wicked and
designing man.""You forget that I am not a boy any longer, mother," said Dan, smiling."I think I can defend myself, even if Mr.Davis is a wicked and
designing person."To her he was
still a boy, though in the eyes of others an athletic young man.Davis at the hotel, Dan was ushered into a room on
the third floor.Seated in an arm-chair was an elderly man, weak and
wasted, apparently in the last stages of consumption."It would have been well if he had not known me, for I did him a great
wrong."said Dan, trying to connect the name with his
father.You see before you Robert Hunting, once your
father's book-keeper."Dan's handsome face darkened, and he said, bitterly:

"You killed my father!""Heaven help me, I fear I did!"sighed Davis--to call him by his later
name."The money of which you robbed him caused him to fail, and failure led
to his death.""I have accused myself of this crime oftentimes," moaned Davis."Don't
think that the money brought happiness, for it did not."From Europe I went to
Brazil, and engaged in business in Rio Janeiro.A year since I found my
health failing, and have come back to New York to die.But before I die
I want to make what reparation I can.""You cannot call my father back to me," said Dan, sadly."No; but I can restore the money that I stole.That is the right
word--stole.I hope you and your mother have not suffered?""We saw some hard times, but for years we have lived in comfort."Will you bring a lawyer to me to-morrow evening?"You might keep every dollar if you would bring my father back."The next evening Davis transferred to Dan and his mother property
amounting to fifty thousand dollars, in payment of what he had taken,
with interest, and in less than a month later he died, Dan taking upon
himself the charge of the funeral.His trip to Europe was deferred, and
having now capital to contribute, he was taken as junior partner into
the firm where he had once filled the position of office-boy.His father had failed disastrously, and
Tom is glad to accept a minor clerkship from the boy at whom he once
sneered.Julia Rogers has never lost her preference for Dan.It is whispered that
they are engaged, or likely soon to be, and Dan's assiduous attentions
to the young lady make the report a plausible one.John Hartley was sentenced to a term of years in prison.Harriet Vernon
dreaded the day of his release, being well convinced that he would seize
the earliest opportunity to renew his persecutions.She had about made
up her mind to buy him off, when she received intelligence that he was
carried off by fever, barely a month before the end of his term.It was
a sad end of a bad life, but she could not regret him.Althea was saved
the knowledge of her father's worthlessness.She was led to believe that
he had died when she was a little girl.Dan, the young detective, has entered
upon a career of influence and prosperity.The hardships of his earlier
years contributed to strengthen his character, and give him that
self-reliance of which the sons of rich men so often stand in need.A
similar experience might have benefited Tom Carver, whose lofty
anticipations have been succeeded by a very humble reality.Let those
boys who are now passing through the discipline of poverty and
privation, take courage and emulate the example of "Dan, the Detective."A. L. BURT'S PUBLICATIONS

For Young People

BY POPULAR WRITERS,

97-99-101 Reade Street, New York.+Bonnie Prince Charlie+: A Tale of Fontenoy and Culloden.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.The
boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a Jacobite
agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches Paris, and
serves with the French army at Dettingen.He kills his father's foe in a
duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the adventures of Prince
Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland."Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of 'Quentin Durward.'The
     lad's journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up
     as good a narrative of the kind as we have ever read.For freshness
     of treatment and variety of incident Mr.Henty has surpassed
     himself."--_Spectator._


     +With Clive in India+; or, the Beginnings of an Empire.By G. A.
     HENTY.With 12 full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in India and
the close of his career was critical and eventful in the extreme.At its
commencement the English were traders existing on sufferance of the
native princes.At its close they were masters of Bengal and of the
greater part of Southern India.The author has given a full and accurate
account of the events of that stirring time, and battles and sieges
follow each other in rapid succession, while he combines with his
narrative a tale of daring and adventure, which gives a lifelike
interest to the volume."He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital
     importance, and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story
     which of itself is deeply interesting.Young people assuredly will
     be delighted with the volume."--_Scotsman._


     +The Lion of the North+: A Tale of Gustavus Adolphus and the Wars of
     Religion.With full-page Illustrations by JOHN
     SCHÖNBERG.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years' War.The issue had its importance, which has extended to
the present day, as it established religious freedom in Germany.The
army of the chivalrous king of Sweden was largely composed of Scotchmen,
and among these was the hero of the story."The tale is a clever and instructive piece of history, and as boys
     may be trusted to read it conscientiously, they can hardly fail to
     be profited."--_Times._


     +The Dragon and the Raven+; or, The Days of King Alfred.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle between
Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents a vivid picture of
the misery and ruin to which the country was reduced by the ravages of
the sea-wolves.The hero, a young Saxon thane, takes part in all the
battles fought by King Alfred.He is driven from his home, takes to the
sea and resists the Danes on their own element, and being pursued by
them up the Seine, is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris."Treated in a manner most attractive to the boyish
     reader."--_Athenæum._


     +The Young Carthaginian+: A Story of the Times of Hannibal.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by C. J. STANILAND, R.I.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest.That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ, and all but
took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of their knowledge.To
let them know more about this momentous struggle for the empire of the
world Mr.Henty has written this story, which not only gives in graphic
style a brilliant description of a most interesting period of history,
but is a tale of exciting adventure sure to secure the interest of the
reader.From first to last nothing
     stays the interest of the narrative.It bears us along as on a
     stream whose current varies in direction, but never loses its
     force."--_Saturday Review._


     +In Freedom's Cause+: A Story of Wallace and Bruce.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish War
of Independence.The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of Wallace
and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry, and indeed
at one time Wallace was ranked with these legendary personages.The
researches of modern historians have shown, however, that he was a
living, breathing man--and a valiant champion.The hero of the tale
fought under both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical
accuracy has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of "hairbreadth'scapes" and wild adventure."It is written in the author's best style.Full of the wildest and
     most remarkable achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which
     a boy, once he has begun it, will not willingly put on one
     side."--_The Schoolmaster._


     +With Lee in Virginia+: A Story of the American Civil War.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely proving his
sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves with no less courage
and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson through the most exciting events of
the struggle.He has many hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded
and twice taken prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two
cases, the devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he
had assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties."One of the best stories for lads which Mr.The picture is full of life and color, and the stirring and
     romantic incidents are skillfully blended with the personal
     interest and charm of the story."--_Standard._


     +By England's Aid+; or, The Freeing of the Netherlands (1585-1604).With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE, and
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in the service
of one of "the fighting Veres."After many adventures by sea and land,
one of the lads finds himself on board a Spanish ship at the time of the
defeat of the Armada, and escapes only to fall into the hands of the
Corsairs.He is successful in getting back to Spain under the protection
of a wealthy merchant, and regains his native country after the capture
of Cadiz.It overflows with stirring
     incident and exciting adventure, and the color of the era and of
     the scene are finely reproduced.The illustrations add to its
     attractiveness."--_Boston Gazette._


     +By Right of Conquest+; or, With Cortez in Mexico.With full-page Illustrations by W. S. STACEY, and Two Maps.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.50.The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under the
magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked among the most
romantic and daring exploits in history.With this as the groundwork of
his story Mr.Henty has interwoven the adventures of an English youth,
Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor of the good ship Swan, which had
sailed from a Devon port to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the
Spaniards in the New World.He is beset by many perils among the
natives, but is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the
devotion of an Aztec princess.At last by a ruse he obtains the
protection of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in
regaining his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec bride."'By Right of Conquest' is the nearest approach to a perfectly
     successful historical tale that Mr.Henty has yet
     published."--_Academy._


     +In the Reign of Terror+: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by J. SCHÖNBERG.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the chateau of
a French marquis, and after various adventures accompanies the family to
Paris at the crisis of the Revolution.Imprisonment and death reduce
their number, and the hero finds himself beset by perils with the three
young daughters of the house in his charge.After hairbreadth escapes
they reach Nantes.There the girls are condemned to death in the
coffin-ships, but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy
protector."Harry Sandwith, the Westminster boy, may fairly be said to beat
     Mr.His adventures will delight boys by the
     audacity and peril they depict.... The story is one of Mr.Henty's
     best."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Wolfe in Canada+; or, The Winning of a Continent.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.Henty gives an account of the struggle between
Britain and France for supremacy in the North American continent.On the
issue of this war depended not only the destinies of North America, but
to a large extent those of the mother countries themselves.The fall of
Quebec decided that the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New
World; that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the English
language, and English literature, should spread right round the globe."It is not only a lesson in history as instructively as it is
     graphically told, but also a deeply interesting and often thrilling
     tale of adventure and peril by flood and field."--_Illustrated
     London News._


     +True to the Old Flag+: A Tale of the American War of Independence.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.In this story the author has gone to the accounts of officers who took
part in the conflict, and lads will find that in no war in which
American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave with
greater courage and good conduct.The historical portion of the book
being accompanied with numerous thrilling adventures with the redskins
on the shores of Lake Huron, a story of exciting interest is interwoven
with the general narrative and carried through the book."Does justice to the pluck and determination of the British
     soldiers during the unfortunate struggle against American
     emancipation.The son of an American loyalist, who remains true to
     our flag, falls among the hostile redskins in that very Huron
     country which has been endeared to us by the exploits of Hawkeye
     and Chingachgook."--_The Times._


     +The Lion of St.Mark+: A Tale of Venice in the Fourteenth Century.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story of Venice at a period when her strength and splendor were put to
the severest tests.The hero displays a fine sense and manliness which
carry him safely through an atmosphere of intrigue, crime, and
bloodshed.He contributes largely to the victories of the Venetians at
Porto d'Anzo and Chioggia, and finally wins the hand of the daughter of
one of the chief men of Venice."Every boy should read 'The Lion of St.Henty has never
     produced a story more delightful, more wholesome, or more
     vivacious."--_Saturday Review._


     +A Final Reckoning+: A Tale of Bush Life in Australia.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by W. B. WOLLEN.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.The hero, a young English lad, after rather a stormy boyhood, emigrates
to Australia, and gets employment as an officer in the mounted police.A
few years of active work on the frontier, where he has many a brush with
both natives and bushrangers, gain him promotion to a captaincy, and he
eventually settles down to the peaceful life of a squatter.Henty has never published a more readable, a more carefully
     constructed, or a better written story than this."--_Spectator._


     +Under Drake's Flag+: A Tale of the Spanish Main.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.A story of the days when England and Spain struggled for the supremacy
of the sea.The heroes sail as lads with Drake in the Pacific
expedition, and in his great voyage of circumnavigation.The historical
portion of the story is absolutely to be relied upon, but this will
perhaps be less attractive than the great variety of exciting adventure
through which the young heroes pass in the course of their voyages."A book of adventure, where the hero meets with experience enough,
     one would think, to turn his hair gray."--_Harper's Monthly
     Magazine._


     +By Sheer Pluck+: A Tale of the Ashanti War.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.The author has woven, in a tale of thrilling interest, all the details
of the Ashanti campaign, of which he was himself a witness.His hero,
after many exciting adventures in the interior, is detained a prisoner
by the king just before the outbreak of the war, but escapes, and
accompanies the English expedition on their march to Coomassie.Henty keeps up his reputation as a writer of boys' stories.'By Sheer Pluck' will be eagerly read."--_Athenæum._


     +By Pike and <DW18>+: A Tale of the Rise of the Dutch Republic.By G.
     A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by MAYNARD BROWN, and 4
     Maps.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Henty traces the adventures and brave deeds of an
English boy in the household of the ablest man of his age--William the
Silent.Edward Martin, the son of an English sea-captain, enters the
service of the Prince as a volunteer, and is employed by him in many
dangerous and responsible missions, in the discharge of which he passes
through the great sieges of the time.He ultimately settles down as Sir
Edward Martin."Boys with a turn for historical research will be enchanted with
     the book, while the rest who only care for adventure will be
     students in spite of themselves."--_St.James' Gazette._


     +St.George for England+: A Tale of Cressy and Poitiers.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.No portion of English history is more crowded with great events than
that of the reign of Edward III.Cressy and Poitiers; the destruction of
the Spanish fleet; the plague of the Black Death; the Jacquerie rising;
these are treated by the author in "St.The hero of
the story, although of good family, begins life as a London apprentice,
but after countless adventures and perils becomes by valor and good
conduct the squire, and at last the trusted friend of the Black Prince.Henty has developed for himself a type of historical novel for
     boys which bids fair to supplement, on their behalf, the historical
     labors of Sir Walter Scott in the land of fiction."--_The
     Standard._


     +Captain Kidd's Gold+: The True Story of an Adventurous Sailor Boy.By JAMES FRANKLIN FITTS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very idea of
buried treasure.A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy Portuguese
and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes--sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the Spanish
Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long, low schooner,
of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting trading craft.There were many famous sea rovers in their day, but none more celebrated
than Capt.Perhaps the most fascinating tale of all is Mr.Fitts'
true story of an adventurous American boy, who receives from his dying
father an ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious
way.The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a
certain island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure buried
there by two of Kidd's crew.The hero of this book, Paul Jones Garry, is
an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water New England ancestry, and
his efforts to reach the island and secure the money form one of the
most absorbing tales for our youth that has come from the press.+Captain Bayley's Heir+: A Tale of the Gold Fields of California.By
     G. A. HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo,
     cloth, price $1.00.A frank, manly lad and his cousin are rivals in the heirship of a
considerable property.The former falls into a trap laid by the latter,
and while under a false accusation of theft foolishly leaves England for
America.He works his passage before the mast, joins a small band of
hunters, crosses a tract of country infested with Indians to the
Californian gold diggings, and is successful both as digger and trader.Henty is careful to mingle instruction with entertainment; and
     the humorous touches, especially in the sketch of John Holl, the
     Westminster dustman, Dickens himself could hardly have
     excelled."--_Christian Leader._


     +For Name and Fame+; or, Through Afghan Passes.With
     full-page Illustrations by GORDON BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.An interesting story of the last war in Afghanistan.The hero, after
being wrecked and going through many stirring adventures among the
Malays, finds his way to Calcutta and enlists in a regiment proceeding
to join the army at the Afghan passes.He accompanies the force under
General Roberts to the Peiwar Kotal, is wounded, taken prisoner, carried
to Cabul, whence he is transferred to Candahar, and takes part in the
final defeat of the army of Ayoub Khan."The best feature of the book--apart from the interest of its
     scenes of adventure--is its honest effort to do justice to the
     patriotism of the Afghan people."--_Daily News._


     +Captured by Apes+: The Wonderful Adventures of a Young Animal
     Trainer.12mo, cloth, $1.00.The scene of this tale is laid on an island in the Malay Archipelago.Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of New York, sets
sail for Eastern seas in quest of a new stock of living curiosities.The
vessel is wrecked off the coast of Borneo and young Garland, the sole
survivor of the disaster, is cast ashore on a small island, and captured
by the apes that overrun the place.The lad discovers that the ruling
spirit of the monkey tribe is a gigantic and vicious baboon, whom he
identifies as Goliah, an animal at one time in his possession and with
whose instruction he had been especially diligent.The brute recognizes
him, and with a kind of malignant satisfaction puts his former master
through the same course of training he had himself experienced with a
faithfulness of detail which shows how astonishing is monkey
recollection.Very novel indeed is the way by which the young man
escapes death.Prentice has certainly worked a new vein on juvenile
fiction, and the ability with which he handles a difficult subject
stamps him as a writer of undoubted skill.+The Bravest of the Brave+; or, With Peterborough in Spain.By G. A.
     HENTY.With full-page Illustrations by H. M. PAGET.12mo, cloth,
     price $1.00.There are few great leaders whose lives and actions have so completely
fallen into oblivion as those of the Earl of Peterborough.This is
largely due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the glory and
successes of Marlborough.His career as general extended over little
more than a year, and yet, in that time, he showed a genius for warfare
which has never been surpassed.Henty never loses sight of the moral purpose of his work--to
     enforce the doctrine of courage and truth.Lads will read 'The
     Bravest of the Brave' with pleasure and profit; of that we are
     quite sure."--_Daily Telegraph._


     +The Cat of Bubastes+: A Story of Ancient Egypt.With
     full-page Illustrations.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight into the
customs of the Egyptian people.Amuba, a prince of the Rebu nation, is
carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.They become inmates of
the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest, and are happy in his
service until the priest's son accidentally kills the sacred cat of
Bubastes.In an outburst of popular fury Ameres is killed, and it rests
with Jethro and Amuba to secure the escape of the high-priest's son and
daughter."The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred
     cat to the perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very
     skillfully constructed and full of exciting adventures.It is
     admirably illustrated."--_Saturday Review._


     +With Washington at Monmouth+: A Story of Three Philadelphia Boys.By
     JAMES OTIS.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon "whose mother conducted a
boarding-house which was patronized by the British officers;" Enoch
Ball, "son of that Mrs.Ball whose dancing school was situated on
Letitia Street," and little Jacob, son of "Chris, the Baker," serve as
the principal characters.The story is laid during the winter when Lord
Howe held possession of the city, and the lads aid the cause by
assisting the American spies who make regular and frequent visits from
Valley Forge.One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread
was scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless
prodigality shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army but a
few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.The story
abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully drawn, and the
glimpses of Washington's soldiers which are given show that the work has
not been hastily done, or without considerable study.+For the Temple+: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem.With full-page Illustrations by S. J. SOLOMON.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.Henty here weaves into the record of Josephus an admirable and
attractive story.The troubles in the district of Tiberias, the march of
the legions, the sieges of Jotapata, of Gamala, and of Jerusalem, form
the impressive and carefully studied historic setting to the figure of
the lad who passes from the vineyard to the service of Josephus, becomes
the leader of a guerrilla band of patriots, fights bravely for the
Temple, and after a brief term of slavery at Alexandria, returns to his
Galilean home with the favor of Titus.Henty's graphic prose pictures of the hopeless Jewish
     resistance to Roman sway add another leaf to his record of the
     famous wars of the world."--_Graphic._


     +Facing Death+; or, The Hero of the Vaughan Pit.A Tale of the Coal
     Mines.With full-page Illustrations by GORDON
     BROWNE.12mo, cloth, price $1.00."Facing Death" is a story with a purpose.It is intended to show that a
lad who makes up his mind firmly and resolutely that he will rise in
life, and who is prepared to face toil and ridicule and hardship to
carry out his determination, is sure to succeed.The hero of the story
is a typical British boy, dogged, earnest, generous, and though
"shamefaced" to a degree, is ready to face death in the discharge of
duty."The tale is well written and well illustrated and there is much
     reality in the characters.If any father, clergyman, or
     schoolmaster is on the lookout for a good book to give as a present
     to a boy who is worth his salt, this is the book we would
     recommend."--_Standard._


     +Tom Temple's Career.+ By HORATIO ALGER.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Tom Temple, a bright, self-reliant lad, by the death of his father
becomes a boarder at the home of Nathan Middleton, a penurious insurance
agent.Though well paid for keeping the boy, Nathan and his wife
endeavor to bring Master Tom in line with their parsimonious habits.The
lad ingeniously evades their efforts and revolutionizes the household.As Tom is heir to $40,000, he is regarded as a person of some importance
until by an unfortunate combination of circumstances his fortune shrinks
to a few hundreds.He leaves Plympton village to seek work in New York,
whence he undertakes an important mission to California, around which
center the most exciting incidents of his young career.Some of his
adventures in the far west are so startling that the reader will
scarcely close the book until the last page shall have been reached.Alger's most fascinating style, and is bound to
please the very large class of boys who regard this popular author as a
prime favorite.+Maori and Settler+: A Story of the New Zealand War.With full-page Illustrations by ALFRED PEARSE.12mo, cloth, price
     $1.00.The Renshaws emigrate to New Zealand during the period of the war with
the natives.Wilfrid, a strong, self-reliant, courageous lad, is the
mainstay of the household.Atherton, a
botanist and naturalist of herculean strength and unfailing nerve and
humor.In the adventures among the Maoris, there are many breathless
moments in which the odds seem hopelessly against the party, but they
succeed in establishing themselves happily in one of the pleasant New
Zealand valleys."Brimful of adventure, of humorous and interesting conversation,
     and vivid pictures of colonial life."--_Schoolmaster._


     +Julian Mortimer+: A Brave Boy's Struggle for Home and Fortune.By
     HARRY CASTLEMON.12mo, cloth, price $1.00.Here is a story that will warm every boy's heart.There is mystery
enough to keep any lad's imagination wound up to the highest pitch.The
scene of the story lies west of the Mississippi River, in the days when
emigrants made their perilous way across the great plains to the land of
gold.One of the startling features of the book is the attack upon the
wagon train by a large party of Indians.Our hero is a lad of uncommon
nerve and pluck, a brave young American in every sense of the word.He
enlists and holds the reader's sympathy from the outset.Surrounded by
an unknown and constant peril, and assisted by the unswerving fidelity
of a stalwart trapper, a real rough diamond, our hero achieves the most
happy results.Harry Castlemon has written many entertaining stories for
boys, and it would seem almost superfluous to say anything in his
praise, for the youth of America regard him as a favorite author."+Carrots+:" Just a Little Boy.With
     Illustrations by WALTER CRANE."One of the cleverest and most pleasing stories it has been our
     good fortune to meet with for some time.Carrots and his sister are

     very fond of."--_Examiner._

     +Mopsa the Fairy.+ By JEAN INGELOW.Ingelow is, to our mind, the most charming of all living
     writers for children, and 'Mopsa' alone ought to give her a kind of
     pre-emptive right to the love and gratitude of our young folks.It
     requires genius to conceive a purely imaginary work which must of
     necessity deal with the supernatural, without running into a mere
     riot of fantastic absurdity; but genius Miss Ingelow has and the
     story of 'Jack' is as careless and joyous, but as delicate, as a
     picture of childhood."--_Eclectic._

adventure, but because it is the only course remaining by which he can
gain a livelihood.While in his bunk, seasick, Ned Rogers hears the
captain and mate discussing their plans for the willful wreck of the
brig in order to gain the insurance.Once it is known he is in
possession of the secret the captain maroons him on Spider Island,

of treasure.Raising the wreck; a voyage to Havana under sail; shipping
there a crew and running for Savannah; the attempt of the crew to seize
the little craft after learning of the treasure on board, and, as a
matter of course, the successful ending of the journey, all serve to
make as entertaining a story of sea-life as the most captious boy could
desire.+Geoff and Jim+: A Story of School Life.Illustrated
