"Do not dare to say that my child's mother was a loose woman!Arthur Wilmersley--may his Maker judge him as he
deserves--wrecked my life, but at least he never doubted my virtue.He
knew that the only way to get me was to marry me.""No--but for a long time I believed that he had.How could a young,
innocent girl have suspected that the man she loved was capable of such
cold-blooded deception?Even now, I cannot blame myself for having
fallen into the trap he baited with such fiendish cunning.Think of
it--he induced me to consent to a secret marriage by promising that if I
made this sacrifice for his sake, he would become a convert to my
religion--my religion!And as we stood together before the altar, I
remember that I thanked God for giving me this opportunity of saving a
soul from destruction.I never dreamed that the church he took me to was
nothing but an old ruin he had fitted up as a chapel for the occasion.How could I guess that the man who married us was not a priest but a
mountebank, whom he had hired to act the part?"Valdriguez bowed her head and the tears trickled through her thin
fingers."I know that not many people would believe you but, well--I do."It
seemed to Cyril as if the words sprang to his lips unbidden."Then indeed you are a good man," exclaimed Valdriguez, "for it is given
only to honest people to have a sure ear for the truth.Now it will be
easier to tell you the rest.Some weeks after we had gone through this
ceremony, first Lord and then Lady Wilmersley died; on her deathbed I
confided to my lady that I was her son's wife and she gave me her
blessing.My humble birth she forgave--after all it was less humble than
her own--and was content that her son had chosen a girl of her own race
and faith.As soon as the funeral was over, I urged my husband to
announce our marriage, but he would not.He proposed that we should go
for a while to the continent so that on our return it would be taken for
granted that we had been married there, and in this way much unpleasant
talk avoided.So we went to Paris and there we lived together openly as
man and wife, not indeed under his name but under mine.He pretended
that he wanted for once to see the world from the standpoint of the
people; that he desired for a short time to be free from the
restrictions of his rank.I myself dreaded so much entering a class so
far above me that I was glad of the chance of spending a few more months
in obscurity.For some weeks I was happy, then Lord Wilmersley began to
show himself to me as he really was.We had taken a large apartment near
the Luxembourg, and soon it became the meeting-ground for the most
reckless element of the Latin Quarter.Ah, if you but knew what sights I
saw, what things I heard in those days!I feared that my very soul was
being polluted, so I consulted a priest as to what I should do.He told
me it was my duty to remain constantly at my husband's side; with prayer
and patience I might some day succeed in reforming him.So I stayed in
that hell and bore the insults and humiliations he heaped upon me
without a murmur.Now, looking back on the past, I think my meekness and
resignation only exasperated him, for he grew more and more cruel and
seemed to think of nothing but how to torture me into revolt.Whether I
should have been given the strength to endure indefinitely, the life he
led me I do not know, but one evening, when we were as usual
entertaining a disreputable rabble, a young man entered.He was dressed in a
brown velveteen suit; a red sash encircled his waist; and on his arm he
flaunted a painted woman.I stood up and turned to
my husband.I could not speak--and he, the man I had loved, only
laughed--laughed!Never shall I forget the sound of that laughter....

"That night my child was born.That was twenty-eight years ago, but it
seems as if it were but yesterday that I held his small, warm body in my
arms.... Then comes a period of which I remember nothing, and when I
finally recovered my senses, they told me my child was dead.... As soon
as I was able to travel, I returned to my old home in Seville and there
I lived, working and praying--praying for my own soul and for that of my
poor baby, who had died without receiving the sacrament of baptism....
Years passed.I had become resigned to my lot, when one day I received a
letter from Lord Wilmersley.If I had only destroyed it unopened,
how much anguish would have been spared me!But at first when I read it,
I thought my happiness would have killed me, for Lord Wilmersley wrote
that my boy was not dead and that if I would meet him in Paris, he would
give me further news of him.At once did I set
out on my journey.On arriving in Paris I went to the hotel he had
indicated and was shown into a private _salon_.There for the first time
in a quarter of a century I saw again the man I had once regarded as my
husband.At first I had difficulty in recognising him, for now his true
character was written in every line of his face and figure.But I hardly
gave a thought either to him or to my wrongs, so great was my impatience
to hear news of my son.... Then that fiend began to play with me as a
cat with a mouse.Yes, my boy lived, had made his way in the world--that
was all he would tell me.My child had been adopted by some well-to-do
people, who had brought him up as their own--no, I needn't expect to
hear another word.Yes, he was a fine, strong lad--he would say no
more.... Can you imagine the scene?Finally, having wrought me up to the
point where I would have done anything to wring the truth from him, he
said to me: 'I have recently married a young wife and I am not such a
fool as to trust my honour in the keeping of a girl who married an old
man like me for his money.Now I have a plan to propose to you.Come and
live with her as her maid and help me to guard her from all eyes, and if
you fulfil your duties faithfully, at the end of three years I promise
that you shall see your son.'"His revolting proposition made my blood boil.Never, never, I told him,
would I accept such a humiliating situation.He merely shrugged his
shoulders and said that in that case I need never hope to hear what had
become of my son.I raved, threatened, pleaded, but he remained
inflexible, and finally I agreed to do his bidding.""So you, who call yourself a Christian, actually consented to help that
wretch to persecute his unfortunate young wife?"Valdriguez flung her head back defiantly.Besides, had she not taken him for better
or worse?Why should I have helped her to break the bonds her own vows
had imposed on her?He did not ill-treat her, far from it.He deprived
her of her liberty, but what of that?A nun has even less freedom than
she had.Think of it, day
after day I had to stand aside and watch the man I had once looked upon
as my husband, lavish his love, his thought, his very life indeed, on
that pretty doll.Although I no longer loved him, my flesh quivered at
the sight.""My lord, I care not for your judgment nor for that of any man.Would you have had me give up that sacred task
because a pink and white baby wanted to flaunt her beauty before the
world?Lady Wilmersley's fate troubles me not at all; but what
breaks my heart is that, as Arthur died just before the three years were
up, I fear that now I shall never know what has become of my boy.Sometimes I have feared that he is dead--but no, I will not believe it!"And in this
room--perhaps within reach of my hand as I stand here--is the paper
which would tell me where he is.Ah, my lord, I beg, I entreat you to
help me to find it!""I will gladly do so, but what reason have you for supposing that there
is such a paper?""It is true that I have only Lord Wilmersley's word for it," she
replied, and her voice sounded suddenly hopeless."Yet not once but many
times he said to me: 'I have a paper in which is written all you wish to
know, but as I do not trust you, I have hidden it, yes, in this very
room have I hidden it.'And now he is dead and I cannot find it!"Even if we cannot find the paper, there are other means of tracing your
son.We will advertise----"

"Never!""I will never consent to do
anything which might reveal to him the secret of his birth.I would long
ago have taken steps to find him, if I had not realised that I could not
do so without taking a number of people into my confidence, and, if I
did that, the story of my shame would be bound to leak out.Not for
myself did I care, but for him.Think of it, if what Lord Wilmersley
told me was true, he holds an honourable position, believes himself the
son of respectable parents.Would it not be horrible, if he should
suddenly learn that he is the nameless child of a servant girl and a
villain?The fear that he should somehow discover the truth is always
before me.That is why I made you swear to keep my secret.""Of course, I will do as you wish, but I assure you that you exaggerate
the risk.Still, let us first search this room thoroughly; then, if we
do not find the paper, it will be time enough to decide what we shall do
next.""Ah, my lord, you are very good to me and may God reward you as you
deserve.And to Cyril's dismay,
Valdriguez suddenly bent down and covered his hands with kisses.CHAPTER XVII

GUY RELENTS


Cyril and Valdriguez spent the next morning making a thorough search of
the library, but the paper they were looking for could not be found.Cyril had from the first been sceptical of success.He could not believe
that her child was still alive and was convinced that Arthur Wilmersley
had fabricated the story simply to retain his hold over the unfortunate
mother.Valdriguez, however, for a long time refused to abandon the
quest.Again and again she ransacked places they had already carefully
examined.When it was finally borne in upon her that there was no
further possibility of finding what she so sought, the light suddenly
went out of her face and she would have fallen if Cyril had not caught
her and placed her in a chair.With arms hanging limply to her sides,
her half-closed eyes fixed vacantly in front of her, she looked as if
death had laid his hand upon her.Thoroughly alarmed, Cyril had the
woman carried to her room and sent for a doctor.When the latter
arrived, he shook his head hopelessly.She had had a stroke; there was
very little he could do for her.In his opinion it was extremely
doubtful if she would ever fully recover her faculties, he said.Cyril having made every possible arrangement for the comfort of the
afflicted woman, at last allowed his thoughts to revert to his own
troubles.He realised that with the elimination of both Valdriguez and Prentice
there was no one but Anita left who could reasonably be suspected of the
murder; for that the two Frenchmen were implicated in the affair, was
too remote a possibility to be seriously considered.No, he must make up
his mind to face the facts: the girl was Anita Wilmersley and she had
killed her husband!What was he going to do, now that he knew the truth?Judson's advice that Anita should give herself up, he rejected without a
moment's hesitation.Yet, he had to acknowledge that there was little
hope of her being able to escape detection, as long as the police knew
her to be alive.... Suddenly an idea occurred to him.If they could only
be made to believe that she was dead, that and that alone would free her
at once and forever from their surveillance.She would be able to leave
England; to resume her life in some distant country where he.... Cyril
shrank instinctively from pursuing the delicious dream further.He tried
to force himself to consider judicially the scheme that was shaping
itself in his mind; to weigh calmly and dispassionately the chances for
and against its success.If a corpse resembling Anita were found,
dressed in the clothes she wore the day she left Geralton, it would
surely be taken for granted that the body was hers and that she had been
murdered.But how on earth was he to procure such a corpse and, having
procured it, where was he to hide it?The neighbourhood of the castle
had been so thoroughly searched that it would be no easy task to
persuade the police that they had overlooked any spot where a body might
be secreted.Certainly the plan presented almost insurmountable
difficulties, but as it was the only one he could think of, Cyril clung
to it with bull-dog tenacity.Impossible is but a word
designed to shield the incompetent or frighten the timid," he muttered
loudly in his heart, unconsciously squaring his broad shoulders.He decided to leave Geralton at once, for the plan must be carried out
immediately or not at all, and it was only in London that he could hope
to procure the necessary assistance.On arriving in town, however, Cyril had to admit that he had really no
idea what he ought to do next.If he could only get in touch with an
impoverished medical student who would agree to provide a body, the
first and most difficult part of his undertaking would be achieved.But
how and where was he to find this indispensable accomplice?Well, it was
too late to do anything that evening, he decided.He might as well go to
the club and get some dinner and try to dismiss the problem from his
mind for the time being.The first person he saw on entering the dining-room was Campbell.He was
sitting by himself at a small table; his round, rosy face depicted the
utmost dejection and he thrust his fork through an oyster with much the
same expression a man might have worn who was spearing a personal enemy.On catching sight of Cyril, he dropped his fork, jumped from his seat,
and made an eager step forward.Then, he suddenly wavered, evidently
uncertain as to the reception Cyril was going to accord him."Well, this is a piece of luck!"cried Cyril, stretching out his hand.Guy, looking decidedly sheepish, clasped it eagerly."I might as well tell you at once that I know I made no end of an ass of
myself the other day," he said, averting his eyes from his friend's
face."It is really pretty decent of you not to have resented my
ridiculous accusations.""Oh, that's all right," Cyril assured him, "I quite understood your
motive.But I am awfully glad you have changed your attitude towards me,
for to tell you the truth, I am in great need of your assistance."ejaculated Campbell, screwing up his face into an expression
of comic despair.As soon as there was no danger of their being overheard, Cyril told
Campbell of his interview with Judson.At first Guy could not be
persuaded that the girl was Anita Wilmersley."She is not a liar, I am sure of it!If she said that her hair had
turned white, it had turned white, and therefore it is impossible that
she had dyed it," objected Campbell."Judson suggested that she dyed only part of her hair and that it was
the rest which turned white."Having finally convinced Guy that there was no doubt as to the girl's
identity, Cyril proceeded to unfold his plan for rescuing her from the
police.Guy adjusted his eye-glass and stared at his friend speechless with
consternation."This affair has turned your brain," he finally gasped."Your plan is
absurd, absolutely absurd, I tell you.Why, even if I could bribe some
one to procure me a corpse, how on earth could you get it to Geralton?""And where under Heaven are you to hide it?""Get me a corpse and I will arrange the rest," Cyril assured him with
more confidence than he really felt."First you saddle me with a lot of stolen jewels and now you want me to
travel around the country with a corpse under my arm!I say, you do
select nice, pleasant jobs for me!""Can't say I have," acknowledged Guy."Are you willing to sit still and see Anita Wilmersley arrested?""Certainly not, but your scheme is a mad one--madder than anything I
should have credited even you with having conceived."Campbell paused a
moment as if considering the question in all its aspects."However, the
fact that it is crazy may save us.The police will not be likely to
suspect two reputable members of society, whose sanity has so far not
been doubted, of attempting to carry through such a wild, impossible
plot.Yes," he mused, "the very impossibility of the thing may make it
possible.""Glad you agree with me," cried Cyril enthusiastically."Now how soon
can you get a corpse, do you think?"You talk as if I could order one from Whiteley's.When
can I get you a corpse--indeed?To-morrow--in a week--a month--a
year--never.The last-mentioned date I consider the most likely.I will
do what I can, that is all I can say; but how I am to go to work, upon
my word, I haven't the faintest idea.""You are an awfully clever chap, Guy."I am the absolute fool, but I am
still sane enough to know it.""Very well, I'll acknowledge that you are a fool and I only wish there
were more like you," said Cyril, clapping his friend affectionately on
the back."By the way," he added, turning away as if in search of a match and
trying to speak as carelessly as possible, "How is Anita?"For a moment Guy did not answer and Cyril stood fumbling with the
matches fearful of the effect of the question.He was still doubtful how
far his friend had receded from his former position and was much
relieved when Guy finally answered in a very subdued voice:

"She is pretty well--but--" He hesitated.He noticed that Guy's face had lengthened
perceptibly and that he toyed nervously with his eye-glass."The fact is," replied Campbell, speaking slowly and carefully avoiding
the other's eye, "I think it is possible that she misses you."Cyril's heart gave a sudden jump."I can hardly believe it," he managed to stutter."Of course, Miss Trevor may be mistaken.It was her idea, not mine, that
Ani--Lady Wilmersley I mean--is worrying over your absence.But whatever
the cause, the fact remains that she has changed very much.She is no
longer frank and cordial in her manner either to Miss Trevor or myself.It seems almost as if she regarded us both with suspicion, though what
she can possibly suspect us of, I can't for the life of me imagine.That
day at lunch she was gay as a child, but now she is never anything but
sad and preoccupied.""Perhaps she is beginning to remember the past," suggested Cyril.Miss Trevor and I have tried everything we could think
of to induce her to confide in us, but she won't.Possibly you might be
more successful--" An involuntary sigh escaped Campbell."I am sorry now
that I prevented you from seeing her.Mind you, I still think it wiser
not to do so, but I ought to have left you free to use your own
judgment.The number of her sitting-room is 62, on the second floor and,
for some reason or other, she insists on being left there alone every
afternoon from three to four.Now I have told you all I know of the
situation and you must handle it as you think best."CHAPTER XVIII

A SLIP OF THE TONGUE


Cyril spent the night in a state of pitiable indecision.Should he or
should he not risk a visit to Anita?If the police were shadowing him,
it would be fatal, but he had somehow lately acquired the conviction
that they were not.On the other hand, if he could only see her, how it
would simplify everything!As she distrusted both Guy and Miss Trevor,
even if his plot succeeded, she would probably refuse to leave England
unless he himself told her that he wished her to do so.Besides, there
were so many details to be discussed, so many arrangements to be talked
over."Yes," he said to himself as he lay staring into the darkness, "it
is my duty to see her.I shall go to her not because I want to...." A
horrid doubt made him pause.Was he so sure that his decision was not
the outcome of his own desire?How could he trust his judgment in a
matter where his inclinations were so deeply involved?Yet it would be
shocking if he allowed his own feelings to induce him to do something
which might be injurious to Anita.It was a nice question to determine
whether her need of him was sufficient to justify him in risking a
visit?For hours he debated with himself but could arrive at no
conclusion.No sooner did he resolve to stay away from her than the
thought of her unhappiness again made him waver.If he only knew why she
was so unhappy, he told himself that the situation would not be so
unendurable.When he had talked to her over the telephone, she had
seemed cheerful; she had spoken of Guy and Miss Trevor with enthusiasm.What could have occurred since then to make her distrust them and to
plunge her into such a state of gloom?As he tossed to and fro on his
hot, tumbled bed, his imagination pictured one dire possibility after
another, till at last he made up his mind that he could bear the
uncertainty no longer.Having reached this decision, Cyril could hardly refrain from rushing
off to her as soon as it was light.However, he had to curb his
impatience.Three o'clock was the only hour he could be sure of finding
her alone; so he must wait till three o'clock.But how on earth, he
asked himself, was he going to get through the intervening time?He was
in a state of feverish restlessness that was almost agony; he could not
apply himself to anything; he could only wait--wait.Although he knew
that there was no chance of his meeting Anita, he haunted the
neighbourhood of the "George" all the morning.Every few minutes he
consulted his watch and the progress of the hands seemed to him so
incredibly slow that more than once he thought that it must have stopped
altogether.Flinging back his shoulders and assuming a carelessness that almost
amounted to a swagger, Cyril entered the hotel.He was so self-conscious
that it was with considerable surprise as well as relief that he noticed
that no one paid the slightest attention to him.Even the porter hardly
glanced at him, being at the moment engaged in speeding a parting guest.Cyril decided to use the stairs in preference to the lift, as they were
less frequented than the latter, and as it happened, he made his way up
to the second landing without encountering anybody.There, however, he came face to face with a pretty housemaid, who to his
dismay looked at him attentively.Had he but
known it, she had been attracted by his tall, soldierly figure and had
merely offered him the tribute of an admiring glance.But this
explanation never occurred to our modest hero and he hurried, quite
absurdly flustered by this trifling incident.62
opened on a small, ill-lighted hall, which was for the moment completely
deserted.Now that he actually stood on the threshold of Anita's room, Cyril felt
a curious reluctance to proceed farther.It was unwise.... She might not
want to see him.... But even as these objections flashed through his
mind, he knocked almost involuntarily.His heart was beating like a sledge-hammer and
his hands were trembling.Never had he experienced such a curious
sensation before and he wondered vaguely what could be the matter with
him."I can't stand here forever," he said in his heart."I wanted to see
her; well then, why don't I open the door?Still reasoning with himself, he finally entered the room.A bright fire was burning on the hearth and before it were heaped a
number of cushions and from this lowly seat Anita had apparently hastily
arisen.The length of time he had taken to answer her summons had
evidently alarmed her, for she stood like a creature at bay, her eyes
wide open and frightened.On recognising Cyril a deep blush suffused her
face and even coloured the whiteness of her throat.Her relief was obvious, yet her manner was distant, almost repellent.Cyril had confidently anticipated such a different reception that her
unexpected coldness completed his discomfiture.He felt as if the
foundations of his world were giving away beneath his feet.He managed,
however, to murmur something, he knew not what.The pounding of his
heart prevented him from thinking coherently.When his emotion had
subsided sufficiently for him to realise what he was doing, he found
himself sitting stiffly on one side of the fire with Anita sitting
equally stiffly on the other.She was talking--no, rather she was
engaging him in polite conversation.How long she had been doing so he
did not know, but he gathered that it could not have been long, as she
was still on the subject of the weather.I hope you had better luck in the
country.To-day has been especially disagreeable," she was saying.Cyril abused the weather with a vigour which was rather surprising, in
view of the fact that till she had mentioned it, he had been sublimely
unconscious whether the sun had been shining or not.But finally even
that prolific topic was exhausted and as no other apparently suggested
itself to either, they relapsed into a constrained silence.He had so longed to see her, and now an
impalpable barrier had somehow arisen between them which separated them
more completely than mere bricks and mortar, than any distance could
have done.True, he could feast his eyes on her cameo-like profile; on
the soft curve of her cheek; on the long, golden-tipped lashes; on the
slender, white throat, which rose like a column from the laces of her
dress.But he dared not look at her too long.Cyril was not
introspective and was only dimly aware of the cause of the turmoil which
was raging in his heart.He did not know that he averted his eyes for
fear that the primitive male within him would break loose from the
fetters of his will and forcibly seize the small creature so temptingly
within his reach."If I only knew what I have done to displease her!"John moved to the bathroom.He longed to question her, but she held herself so rigidly aloof that he
had not the courage to do so.It was in vain that he told himself that
her coldness simplified the situation; that it would have been terrible
to have had to repel her advances; but he could find no consolation in
the thought.In speechless misery he sat gazing into the fire.Suddenly he thrilled with the consciousness that she was looking at him.The glance they exchanged was of the briefest duration, but it sufficed
to lift the weight which had been crushing him.The corners of her mouth quivered slightly, but she did not answer."If I have," he continued, "I assure you it was quite unintentionally.Why, I would give my life to save you a moment's pain.Can't you feel
that I am speaking the truth?"She turned her face towards him, and as he looked at her, Cyril realised
that it was not only her manner which had altered; she herself had
mysteriously altered.At first he could not define wherein the
difference lay, but suddenly it flashed upon him.It was the expression
of her eyes which had changed.Heretofore he had been confident that
they reflected her every emotion; but now they were inscrutable.It was
as if she had drawn a veil over her soul."I don't know what you mean," she said.There was more than a hint of
hostility in her voice.If my visit is
distasteful to you, you have only to say so and I will go."As she did not immediately answer, he added:

"Perhaps I had better go."His tone, however, somehow implied more of a
threat than a suggestion; for since they had exchanged that fleeting
glance Cyril had felt unreasonably reassured.Despite her coldness, the
memory of her tender entreaties for his speedy return, buoyed up his
conceit.She could not be as indifferent to him as she seemed, he argued
to himself.However, as the moments passed and she offered no objection
to his leaving her, his newly-aroused confidence evaporated.But he made
no motion to do so; he could not."I can't leave her till I know how I have offended her.... There are so
many arrangements to be made.... I must get in touch with her again,--"
were some of the excuses with which he tried to convince himself that he
had a right to linger.He tried to read her face, but she had averted her head till he could
see nothing but one small, pink ear, peeping from beneath her curls."It is a little difficult to know how you wish to be treated!"Her
manner was icy, but his relief was so intense that he scarcely noticed
it."She is piqued, that
is the whole trouble."He felt a man once more, master of the situation."She probably expected me to--" He shrank from pursuing the thought any
further as the hot blood surged to his face.He was again conscious of
his helplessness."I suppose you
think me cold and unfeeling?She seemed startled by his vehemence, for she looked up at him timidly."Won't you tell me what has come
between us?"Right and wrong ceased to exist for
him.He forgot everything; stooping forward he gathered her into his
arms and crushed her small body against his heart.She thrust him from her with unexpected force and stood before him with
blazing eyes."You cannot treat me like a child, who can be neglected one day and
fondled the next!At the nursing home I was too weak
and confused to realise how strangely you were behaving, but now I know.You dare to complain of my coldness--my coldness indeed!Is my coldness
a match to yours?"If you do, then your conduct is all the more inexplicable.If you do,
then I ask you, what is it, who is it, that stands between us?""If I could tell you, don't you suppose I would?""Then there is some one, some person who is keeping us apart!""Ah, you see, you can't deny it!He hardly knew what he was saying; the words seemed to have leaped to
his lips.She regarded him for a second in silence evidently only partially
convinced.He had momentarily forgotten his wife, and
although he tried to convince himself that he had spoken the truth and
that it was not she who was keeping them apart, yet he had to
acknowledge that if he had been free, he would certainly have behaved
very differently towards Anita.So in a sense he had lied to her and as
he realised this, his eyes sank before hers.She did not fail to note
his embarrassment and pressed her point inexorably."Swear that there is no other woman who has a claim on you and I will
believe you."He could not lie to her in cold blood.Yet to tell her the truth was
also out of the question, he said to himself.While he still hesitated, she continued more vehemently."I don't ask you to tell me anything of your past or my past, if you had
rather not do so.One thing, however, I must and will know--who is this
woman and what are her pretensions?""I--I cannot tell you," he said at last.Some day,
I promise you, you shall know everything, but now it is impossible.But
this much I will say--I love you as I have never loved any one in my
whole life."She trembled from head to foot and half closed her eyes.Cyril felt that this very silence
established a communion between them, more complete, more intense than
any words could have done.But as he gazed at the small, drooping
figure, he felt that his self-control was deserting him completely.He
almost reeled with the violence of his emotion."I can't stand it another moment," he said to himself."I must go
before--" He did not finish the sentence but clenched his hands till the
knuckles showed white through the skin.I can't tell you
what I feel.He murmured incoherently and seizing her hands,
he pressed them for an instant against his lips, then dropping them
abruptly, he fled from the room.Cyril in his excitement had not noticed that he had called Anita by her
name nor did he perceive the start she gave when she heard it.After the
door had clicked behind him, she sat as if turned to stone, white to her
very lips.Slowly, as if with an effort, her lips moved.she repeated over and over
again as if she were trying to learn a difficult lesson.But the tension had been too great; with a little gasp she sank fainting
to the floor.CHAPTER XIX

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR


What he did during the next few hours, Cyril never quite knew.He
retained a vague impression of wandering through endless streets and of
being now and then arrested in his heedless course by the angry
imprecations of some wayfarer he had inadvertently jostled or of some
Jehu whose progress he was blocking.How could he have behaved like such a fool, he kept asking himself.He
had not said a thing to Anita that he had meant to say--not one.Worse
still, he had told her that he loved her!He had even held her in his
arms!Cyril tried not to exult at the thought.He told himself again and
again that he had acted like a cad; nevertheless the memory of that
moment filled him with triumphant rapture.Had he lost all sense of
shame, he wondered.He tried to consider Anita's situation, his own
situation; but he could not.He could think
neither of the past nor of the future; he could think of nothing
connectedly.The daylight waned and still he tramped steadily onward.Finally,
however, his body began to assert itself.His footsteps grew gradually
slower, till at last he realised that he was miles from home and that he
was completely exhausted.Hailing a passing conveyance, he drove to his
lodgings.He was still so engrossed in his dreams that he felt no surprise at
finding Peter sitting in the front hall, nor did he notice the dejected
droop of the latter's shoulders.On catching sight of his master, Peter sprang forward.My lord," he whispered with his finger on his lip; and turning
slightly, he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder towards the
top of the stairs.With an effort Cyril shook off his preoccupation.Following the
direction of his servant's eyes, he saw nothing more alarming than a few
dusty plants which were supposed to adorn the small landing where the
stairs turned.Before he had time to form a conjecture as to the cause
of Peter's agitation, the latter continued breathlessly: "Her Ladyship
'ave arrived, my lord!"Having made this announcement, he stepped back as if to watch what
effect this information would have on his master.There was no doubt
that Peter's alarm was very genuine, yet one felt that in spite of it he
was enjoying the dramatic possibilities of the situation.Cyril, however, only blinked at him uncomprehendingly."Lady Wilmersley, my lord, and she brought her baggage.I haven't known
what to do, that I haven't.I knew she ought not to stay here, but I
couldn't turn 'er out, could I?"Cyril's mind was so full of Anita that he never doubted that it was she
to whom Peter was referring, so without waiting to ask further
questions, he rushed upstairs two steps at a time, and threw open the
door of his sitting-room.On a low chair in front of the fire his wife sat reading quietly.Cyril staggered back as if he had been struck.She, however, only turned
her head languidly and closing her book, surveyed him with a mocking
smile.His disappointment added fuel to his
indignation.She seemed in nowise affected by his anger; only her expression became,
if possible, a trifle more contemptuous."Your manners have sadly deteriorated since we parted," she remarked,
raising her eyebrows superciliously.he exclaimed and his voice actually shook with rage."May I
ask how you expected to be received?Is it possible that you imagine
that I am going to take you back?"Her eyes narrowed, but she still appeared quite unconcerned."Do you know, I rather think you will," she drawled."Take you back, now that you have tired of your lover or he has become
disgusted with you, which is probably nearer the truth.Do you think I
am mad, or are you?"He fancied that he saw her wince, but she replied calmly:

"Do not let us indulge in mutual recriminations.What have you to reproach
me with?Didn't I marry you to save you from disgrace and penury?Haven't I done everything I could to keep you straight?"She rose slowly from her seat and he noticed for the first time that she
wore a low-cut gown of some diaphanous material, which revealed and yet
softened the too delicate lines of her sinuous figure.Her black hair
lay in thick waves around her face, completely covering the ears, and
wound in a coil at the back of her neck.He had never seen it arranged
in this fashion and reluctantly he had to admit that it was strangely
becoming to her.A wide band of dull gold, set with uncut gems,
encircled her head and added a barbaric note to her exotic beauty.It
was his last gift to her, he remembered.Yes, she was still beautiful, he acknowledged, although the life she had
led, had left its marks upon her.She looked older and frailer than when
he had seen her last.But to-night the sunken eyes glowed with
extraordinary brilliancy and a soft colour gave a certain roundness to
her hollow cheeks.As she stood before him, Cyril was conscious, for the
first time in years, of the alluring charm of her personality.She regarded him for a moment, her full red lips parted in an
inscrutable smile.In some mysterious way it suggested infinite
possibilities."You tried everything, I grant you," she said at last, "except the one
thing which would have proved efficacious."Yes, it was true, he
acknowledged to himself.Had he not realised it during the last few days
as he had never done before?"You don't even take the trouble to deny it," she continued."You
married me out of pity and instead of being ashamed of it, you actually
pride yourself on the purity of your motive.""Well, at any rate I can't see what there was to be ashamed of," he
replied indignantly.Oh, how you good people exasperate me!You seem to
lack all comprehension of the natural cravings of a normal human being."It was not my fault that I could not love you.""No, but knowing that you did not love me, it was dastardly of you to
have married me without telling me the truth.In doing so, you took from
me my objective in life--you destroyed my ideals.Oh, don't look so
sceptical, you fool!Can't you see that I should never have remained a
governess until I was twenty-five, if I had not had ideals?It was
because I had such lofty conceptions of love that I kept myself
scrupulously aloof from men, so that I might come to my mate, when I
found him, with soul, mind, and body unsullied."She spoke with such passionate sincerity that it was with an effort
Cyril reminded himself that her past had not been as blameless as she
pictured it."Your fine ideals did not prevent you from becoming a drunkard--" he
remarked drily."When I married, I was not a drunkard," she vehemently protested."The
existence I led was abhorrent to me, and it is true that occasionally
when I felt I could not stand it another moment, I would go to my room
after dinner and get what comfort I could out of alcohol; but what I
did, I did deliberately and not to satisfy an ungovernable appetite.I
was no more a drunkard than a woman who takes a dose of morphine during
bodily agony is a drug fiend.Of course, my conduct seems inexcusable to
you, for you are quite incapable of understanding the torture my life
was to me.""Other women have suffered far greater misfortunes and have borne them
with fortitude and dignity.""Look at me, Cyril; even now am I like other women?""Was it my fault that I was born with beauty that demanded its
due?Was I to blame that my blood leaped wildly through my veins, that
my imagination was always on fire?But I was, and still am,
instinctively and fundamentally a virtuous woman.Oh, you may sneer, but
it is true!Although as a girl I was starving for love, I never accepted
passion as a substitute, and you can't realise how incessantly the
latter was offered me.Wherever I went, I was persecuted by it.At times
I had a horrible fear that desire was all that I was capable of evoking;
and when you came to me in my misery, poverty, and disgrace, I hailed
you as my king--my man!I believed that you were offering me a love so
great that it welcomed the sacrifice of every minor consideration.It
never occurred to me that you would dare to ask me for myself, my life,
my future, unless you were able to give me in exchange something more
than the mere luxuries of existence.""I also offered you my life----"

"You did not!""You offered up your life, not to
me, but to your own miserable conception of chivalry.The greatness of
your sacrifice intoxicated you and consequently it seemed to you
inevitable that I also would spend the rest of my days in humble
contemplation of your sublime character?""Such an idea never occurred to me," Cyril angrily objected."Oh, you never formulated it in so many words, I know that!You are too
self-conscious to be introspective and are actually proud of the fact
that you never stop to analyse either yourself or your motives.So you
go blundering through life without in the least realising what are the
influences which shape your actions.You fancy that you are not
self-centred because you are too shy, yes, and too vain to probe the
hidden recesses of your heart.You imagine that you are unselfish
because you make daily sacrifices to your own ideal of conduct.But of
that utter forgetfulness of self, of that complete merging and
submerging of your identity in another's, you have never had even the
vaguest conception.When you married me, it never occurred to you that I
had the right to demand both love and comprehension.You, the idealist,
expected me to be satisfied with the material advantages you offered;
but I, the degraded creature you take me to be, had I known the truth,
would never have consented to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.""That sounds all very fine, and I confess I may not have been a perfect
husband, but after all, what would you have done, I should like to know,
if I had not married you?"I would have worked and hoped, and if work had failed me, I would
have begged and hoped.I would even have starved, before abandoning the
hope that some day I should find the man who was destined for me.When I
at last realised that you did not love me, you cannot imagine my
despair.I consumed myself in futile efforts to please you, but the very
intensity of my love prevented me from exercising those arts and
artifices which might have brought you to my feet.My emotion in your
presence was so great that it sealed my lips and made you find me a dull
companion."You know very well that it was not that which
alienated me from you.When I married you, I may not have been what is
called in love with you, but I was certainly fond of you, and if you had
behaved yourself, I should no doubt in time have become more closely
united to you.You talk of 'consuming' yourself to please me.But you chose a
strange means of gaining my affections when you took to disgracing
yourself both privately and publicly."The passionate resentment which had transfigured her slowly faded from
Amy's face, leaving it drawn and old; her voice, when she spoke, sounded
infinitely weary."When I knew for a certainty that a lukewarm affection was all you would
ever feel for me, I lost hope, and in losing hope, I lost my foothold on
life.I wanted to die--I determined to die.Time and time again, I
pressed your pistol to my forehead, but something stronger than my will
always prevented me from pulling the trigger; and finally I sought
forgetfulness in drink, because I had not the courage to find it in
death.At first I tried to hide my condition from you, but there came a
moment when the sight of your bland self-satisfaction became unbearable,
when your absolute unconsciousness of the havoc you had made of my life
maddened me.Oh, not as I had suffered, you are
not capable of that; but at any rate I could hurt your vanity and deal a
death-blow to your pride!You had disgraced me when you tricked me into
giving myself to a man who did not love me; I determined to disgrace you
by reeling through the public streets.she cried
with indescribable bitterness."When I saw you grow pale with anger,
when I saw you tremble with shame, I suppose you fancy that I must, at
times, have suffered from remorse and humiliation?I swear that never
for a moment have I regretted the course I chose.I am ashamed of
nothing except that I lacked the courage to kill myself.How I welcomed the gradual deadening of my senses, the dulling of my
fevered brain!When I awoke from my long torpor and found myself at
Charleroi, I cursed the doctor who had brought me back to life.The thought of you haunted me day and
night, while a raging thirst racked my body, and from this twofold
torture the constant supervision of the nurses prevented me from
obtaining even a temporary respite.For a moment Cyril felt a wave of pity sweep over him, but suddenly he
stiffened."You forget to mention that--consolation was offered you."Had I found that, I should not be here!I admit, however,
that when I first noticed that M. de Brissac was attracted by me, I was
mildly pleased.It was a solace to my wounded vanity to find that some
one still found me desirable.But I swear that it never even occurred to
me to give myself to him, till the doctor told me that you were coming
to take me away with you.Subject myself anew to your
indifference--your contempt?So I took the only means of escaping
from you which offered itself.And I am glad, glad that I flung myself
into the mire, for by defiling love, I killed it.I am at last free from
the obsession which has been the torment of my life.Neither you nor any
other man will again fire my imagination or stir my senses.I am dead,
but I am also free--free!"As she spoke the last words her expression was so exalted that Cyril was
forced to grant her his grudging admiration.As she stood before him,
she seemed more a spirit than a woman; she seemed the incarnation of
life, of love, of the very fundamentals of existence.She was really an
extraordinary woman; why did he not love her, he asked himself.But even
as this flashed through his mind the memory of his long martyrdom
obtruded itself.He saw her again not as she appeared then, but as the
central figure in a succession of loathsome scenes."Your attempt to justify yourself may impose on others, but not on me.What you term love is
nothing but an abnormal craving, which no healthy-minded man with his
work in life to do could have possibly satisfied.Our code, however, is
too different for me to discuss the matter with you.And so, if you have
quite finished expatiating on my shortcomings, would you kindly tell me
to what I owe the honour of your visit?"She turned abruptly from him and leaned for a minute against the
mantelpiece; then, sinking into a chair, she took a cigarette from a box
which lay on the table near her and proceeded to light it with apparent
unconcern.Cyril, however, noticed that her hand trembled violently.After inhaling a few puffs, she threw her head back and looked at him
tauntingly from between her narrowed lids."Because, my dear Cyril, I read in yesterday's paper that your wife had
been your companion on your ill-timed journey from Paris.So I thought
it would be rather amusing to run over and find out a few particulars as
to the young person who is masquerading under my name."She had caught Cyril completely off his guard and he felt for a moment
incapable of parrying her attack."I assure you," he stuttered, "it is all a mistake--" He hesitated; he
could think of no explanation which would satisfy her."I expected you to tell me that she was as pure as snow!""But how you with your puritanic ideas managed to
get yourself into such an imbroglio passes my understanding.Really, I
consider that you owe it to me, to satisfy my curiosity.""I regret that I am unable to do so."Still, as I shall no doubt solve the riddle in a few days, I
can possess my soul in patience.Meanwhile I shall enjoy watching your
efforts to prevent me from learning the truth.""Unfortunately for you, that pleasure will be denied you.You are going
to leave this house at once and we shall not meet again till we do so
before judge and jury.""So you will persist in trying to bluff it out?Don't you
realise that I hold all the cards and that I am quite clever enough to
use them to the best advantage?You see, knowing you as I do, I am
convinced that the motive which led you to sacrifice both truth and
honour is probably as praiseworthy as it is absurd.But having made such
a sacrifice, why are you determined to render it useless?I cannot
believe that you are willing to face the loss not only of your own
reputation but of that of the young person who has accepted your
protection.How do you fancy she would enjoy figuring as corespondent in
a divorce suit?"Cyril felt as if he were caught in a trap."My God," he cried, "you wouldn't do that!I swear to you that she is
absolutely innocent.She was in a terrible situation and to say that she
was my wife seemed the only way to save her.She doesn't even know I am
married!"And have you never considered that when she finds out the
truth, she may fail to appreciate the delicacy which no doubt prevented
you from mentioning the trifling fact of my existence?It is rather
funny that your attempts to rescue forlorn damsels seem doomed to be
unsuccessful!Or were your motives in this case not quite so impersonal
as I fancied?Has Launcelot at last found his Guinevere?If so, I may
yet be avenged vicariously.""Your presence is punishment enough, I assure you, for all the sins I
ever committed!What exactly is it that you are
threatening me with?"If neither you nor this woman object to its
being known that you travelled together as man and wife, then I am
powerless.""But you have just acknowledged that you know that our relation is a
harmless one," cried Cyril."I do not know it--but--yes, I believe it.Do you think, however, that
any one else will do so?""Surely you would not be such a fiend as to wreck the life of an
innocent young girl?""If her life is wrecked, whose fault is it?It
was you who by publicly proclaiming her to be your wife, made it
impossible for her disgrace to remain a secret.Don't you realise that
even if I took no steps in the matter, sooner or later the truth is
bound to be discovered?Now I--and I alone--can save you from the
consequences of your folly.If you will agree not to divorce me, I
promise not only to keep your secret, but to protect the good name of
this woman by every means in my power.""I should like to know what you expect to gain by trying to force me to
take you back?Is it the title that you covet, or do you long to shine
in society?But remember that in order to do that, you would have
radically to reform your habits.""I have no intention of reforming and I don't care a fig for
conventional society!""You tell me that you no longer love me and that you found existence
with me unsupportable.Why then are you not willing to end it?""It is true, I no longer love you, but while I live, no other woman
shall usurp my place."When you broke your marriage vows, you forfeited your right
to a place in my life.You can have
all the money you can possibly want as long as you neither do nor say
anything to imperil the reputation of the young lady in question.""All the wealth in the world could not buy my silence!""In order to
shield a poor innocent child, you demand that I sacrifice my freedom, my
future, even my honour?Have you no sense of justice, no pity?"It is now for you to decide whether I
am to go or stay.Cyril looked into her white, set face; what he read there destroyed his
last, lingering hope."Stay," he muttered through his clenched teeth.CHAPTER XX

"I KNOW IT, COUSIN CYRIL"


Cyril leaned wearily back in his chair.He was in that state of
apathetic calm which sometimes succeeds a violent emotion.Of his wife
he had neither seen or heard anything since they parted the night
before.Cyril started, for he had not noticed Peter's entrance and the
suppressed excitement of the latter's manner alarmed him."She's 'ere, my lord," replied Peter, dropping his voice till it was
almost a whisper."The--the young lady, my lord, as you took charge of on the train.I was
just passing through the 'all as she came in and so----"

"Here?""Why didn't you show her up at once?""If 'er Ladyship should 'ear----"

"Mind your own business, you fool, or----"

But Peter had already scuttled out of the room.Cyril waited, every nerve strung to the highest tension.Yet if his visitor was really Anita, some new
misfortune must have occurred!It seemed to him ages before the door
again opened and admitted a small, cloaked figure, whose features were
practically concealed by a heavy veil.A glance, however, sufficed to
assure him that it was indeed Anita who stood before him.While Cyril
was struggling to regain his composure, she lifted her veil.The
desperation of her eyes appalled him.cried Cyril, striding forward and seizing
her hands."Lord Wilmersley--" Cyril jumped as if he had been shot."Yes," she
continued, "I know who you are.For the first time the ghost of a smile hovered round her lips.What a blundering fool I have been from first to last!"For some days I had been haunted by
fragmentary visions of the past and before I saw you yesterday, I was
practically certain that you were not my husband.It was not without
a struggle that I finally made up my mind that you had deceived me.I
told myself again and again that you were not the sort of a man who
would take advantage of an unprotected girl; yet the more I thought
about it, the more convinced I became that my suspicions were correct.Then I tried to imagine what reason you could have for posing as my
husband, but I could think of none.I didn't know what
to do, whom to turn to; for if I could not trust you, whom could I
trust?When I heard my name, it was as if a dim light suddenly flooded
my brain.I remembered leaving Geralton, but little by
little I realised with dismay that I was still completely in the dark as
to who you were, why you had come into my life.It seemed to me that if
I could not discover the truth, I should go mad.Then I decided to
appeal to Miss Trevor.I was somehow convinced that she did not know who I was, but I said
to myself that she would certainly have heard of my disappearance, for I
could not believe that Arthur had allowed me to go out of his life
without moving heaven and earth to find me.""No; it was Miss Trevor who told me that Arthur was dead--that he had
been murdered.""You see," she added with
pathetic humility, "there are still so many things I do not remember.Even now I can hardly believe that I, I of all people, killed my
husband."Cyril ached for pity of her."Why take it for granted that you did?"he suggested, partly from a
desire to comfort her, but also because there really lingered a doubt in
his mind."Not at present, but----"

She threw up her hands with a gesture of despair.But I never meant to--you will believe that, won't
you?Those doctors were right, I must have been insane!"Arthur only intended to frighten you by sending
for those men.""But if I was not crazy, why can I remember so little of what took place
on that dreadful night and for some time afterwards?""I am told that a severe shock often has that effect," replied Cyril."But, oh, how I wish you could answer a few questions!I don't want to
raise your hopes; but there is one thing that has always puzzled me and
till that is explained I for one shall always doubt whether it was you
who killed Arthur."Again the eager light leaped into her eyes."Oh, tell me quickly what--what makes you think that I may not have done
so?"Cyril contemplated her a moment in silence.He longed to pursue the
topic, but was fearful of the effect it might have on her."Yet now that she knows the worst, it may be a relief to her to talk
about it," he said to himself."Yes, I will risk it," he finally
decided."Do you remember that you put a drug in Arthur's coffee?""Then you must have expected to make your escape before he regained
consciousness.""Then why did you arm yourself with a pistol?""But if you shot Arthur, you must have had a pistol."She stared at Cyril in evident bewilderment."I could have sworn I had no pistol."Cyril tried to control his rising excitement."You knew, however, that
Arthur owned one?""Yes, but I never knew where he kept it.""You are sure you have not forgotten----"

"No, no!""My memory is perfectly clear up to the
time when Arthur seized me and threw me on the floor.""Oh, yes, I have a vague recollection of a long walk through the
dark--of a train--of you--of policemen.But everything is so confused
that I can be sure of nothing."Cyril paced the room deep in thought."It seems to me incredible," he said at last, "that if you did not even
know where to look for a pistol, you should have found it, to say
nothing of having been able to use it, while you were being beaten into
unconsciousness by that brute.""It is extraordinary, and yet I must have done so.For it has been
proved, has it not, that Arthur and I were absolutely alone?"How can we be sure that some one was not concealed in
the room or did not climb in through the window or--why, there are a
thousand possibilities which can never be proved!"she exclaimed, her whole body trembling with eagerness."I now
remember that I had put all my jewels in a bag, and as that has
disappeared, a burglar--" But as she scanned Cyril's face, she paused."You had the bag with you at the nursing home.The jewels are safe," he
said very gently."Then," she cried, "it is useless trying to deceive ourselves any
longer--I killed Arthur and must face the consequences.""But don't you see that I can't spend the rest of my life in hiding?Think what it would mean to live in daily, hourly dread of exposure?That is not what
I am afraid of.But the idea of you, Anita, in prison.Why, it is out of
the question."And if it did, what of it?"There is nothing you can do," she said, laying her hand gently on his
arm.Oh, I can never thank you enough
for all your goodness to me!""Don't--don't--I would gladly give my life for you!""I know it, Cousin Cyril," she murmured, with downcast eyes.A wave of
colour swept for a moment over her face.With a mighty effort he strove to regain his composure.Yes, that was what he was to her--that was all he could
ever be to her."I know how noble, how unselfish you are," she continued, lifting her
brimming eyes to his.Anita, is it possible that you----"

"Hush!Let me go," she cried, for Cyril had seized
her hand and was covering it with kisses.Cyril and Anita moved hurriedly
away from each other."Inspector Griggs is 'ere, my lord."Peter's face had resumed its usual stolid expression.He appeared not to
notice that his master and the latter's guest were standing in strained
attitudes at opposite ends of the room.Cyril motioned Peter impatiently away."This is the best
time for me to give myself up."I have a plan----"

He was interrupted by the reappearance of Peter."The inspector is very sorry, my lord, but he has to see you at once, 'e
says.""It is no use putting it off," Anita said firmly.If you don't, I shall go down and speak to him myself."Cyril did not know what to do.So turning to the latter, he said:

"You can bring him up in ten minutes--not before."Anita," implored Cyril, as soon as they were again alone, "I beg you
not to do this thing.If a plan that I have in mind succeeds, you will
be able to leave the country and begin life again under another name."She listened attentively, but when he had finished she shook her head."I will not allow you to attempt it.If your fraud were discovered--and
it would surely be discovered--your life would be ruined.""I tell you I will not hear of it.No, I am determined to end this
horrible suspense."I entreat you at all events to wait a little while longer."Was there
nothing he could say to turn her from her purpose?If she should hear, if she should know--" he began
tentatively.He was amazed at the effect of his words."Why didn't you tell me that she was here?""Of course, I haven't the slightest intention of
involving her in my affairs."But you can't leave the house without Griggs seeing you, and he would
certainly guess who you are.Stay in the next room till he is gone, that
is all I ask of you.Here, quick, I hear footsteps on the stairs."Cyril had hardly time to fling himself into a chair before the inspector
was announced.CHAPTER XXI

THE TRUTH


"Good-morning, my lord.Rather early to disturb you, I am afraid."Cyril noticed that Griggs's manner had undergone a subtle change.Although perfectly respectful, he seemed to hold himself rigidly aloof.There was even a certain solemnity about his trivial greeting.Cyril
felt that another blow was impending.Instantly and instinctively he
braced himself to meet it."The fact is, my lord, I should like to ask you a few questions, but I
warn you that your answers may be used against you.""Have you missed a bag, my lord?"It has turned up at last," thought Cyril.He knows more about my things than I do," he
managed to answer, as he lifted a perfectly expressionless face to
Griggs's inspection.But I fancy that as far as this particular bag is
concerned, that is not the case.""Because I do not see what reason he could have had for hiding one of
his master's bags up the chimney.""So the bag was found up the chimney?Will you tell me what motive I am
supposed to have had for wishing to conceal it?Did it contain anything you thought I might want to
get rid of?"We know that Priscilla Prentice bought this bag a
fortnight ago in Newhaven.Now, if you are able to explain how it came
into your possession, I would strongly advise your doing so.""I have never to my knowledge laid eyes on the girl, and I cannot,
therefore, believe that a bag of hers has been found here.""We can prove it," replied the inspector."The maker's name is inside
and the man who sold it to her is willing to swear that it is the
identical bag.One of our men has made friends with your chamber-maid
and she confessed that she had discovered it stuffed up the chimney in
your bedroom.She is a stupid girl and thought you had thrown it away,
so she took it.Only afterwards, it occurred to her that you had a
purpose in placing the bag where she had found it and she was going to
return it when my man prevented her from doing so."I congratulate
you, Inspector," said Cyril, trying to speak superciliously."But you
omitted to mention the most important link in the chain of evidence you
have so cleverly forged against me," he continued."How am I supposed to
have got hold of this bag?I did not stop in Newhaven and you have had
me so closely watched that you must know that since my arrival in
England I have met no one who could have given it to me.""No, my lord, we are by no means sure of this.It is
true that we have, so to speak, kept an eye on you, but, till yesterday,
we had no reason to suspect that you had any connection with the murder,
so we did not think it necessary to have you closely followed.There
have been hours when we have had no idea where you were.""It is quite possible," continued the inspector without heeding Cyril's
interruption, "that you have met either Prentice or Lady Wilmersley, the
dowager, I mean."And why should they have given this bag to me, of all people?Surely you must see that they could have found many easier, as well as
safer, ways of disposing of it.""Quite so, my lord, and that is why I am inclined to believe that it was
not through either of them that the bag came into your possession.I
think it more probable that her Ladyship brought it with her.""You told me yourself that her Ladyship met you in Newhaven; that, in
fact, she had spent the night of the murder there."Cyril clutched the table convulsively.Why had it never
occurred to him that his lies might involve an innocent person?"But this is absurd, you know," he stammered, in a futile effort to gain
time."There has been a terrible mistake, I tell you.""In that case her Ladyship can no doubt easily explain it."But if you
wish it, I will not question her till she has been examined by our
doctors."Cyril rose and moved automatically towards the door."Sorry, my lord, but for the present you can see her Ladyship only
before witnesses."What is the use of asking my permission?You are master here, so it
seems," exclaimed Cyril.His nerves were at last getting beyond his
control."I am only doing my duty and I assure you that I want to cause as little
unpleasantness as possible.""Ask her Ladyship please to come here as soon as she can get ready.If
she is asleep, it will be necessary to wake her."The two men sat facing each other in silence.Cyril was hardly conscious of the other's presence.He must think; he
knew he must think; but his brain seemed paralysed.There must be a way
of clearing his wife without casting suspicion on Anita.Was it possible that he was now called upon to choose
between the woman he hated and the woman he loved, between honour and
dishonour?The door opened and Amy came slowly into the room.She was wrapped in a red velvet dressing-gown and its warm colour
contrasted painfully with the greyness of her face and lips.On catching
sight of the inspector, she started, but controlling herself with an
obvious effort, she turned to her husband."You can see for yourself, Inspector, that her Ladyship is in no
condition to be questioned," remonstrated Cyril, moving quickly to his
wife's side."Just as you say, my lord, but in that case her Ladyship had better
finish her dressing.It will be necessary for her to accompany me to
headquarters.""I will not allow it," cried Cyril, almost beside himself and throwing a
protecting arm around Amy's shoulders.Her bloodshot eyes rested a moment on her husband, then gently
disengaging herself, she drew herself to her full height and faced the
inspector."His Lordship----"

"Do not listen to his Lordship.It is I who demand to be told the
truth.""Amy, I beg you--" interposed Cyril."No, no," she cried, shaking off her husband's hand.Don't you see that you are torturing me?"It is all my fault," began Cyril."I am waiting to hear what the inspector has to say."Griggs cast a questioning look at Cyril, which the latter answered by a
helpless shrug."A bag has been found in his Lordship's chimney, which was lately
purchased in Newhaven.But perhaps before
answering, you may wish to consult your legal adviser.""I will neither acknowledge nor deny anything until I have seen this bag
and know of what I am accused," she answered after a barely perceptible
pause.Griggs opened the door and called:

"Jones, the bag, please."Had the moment come when he must proclaim the truth?"Am I supposed to have bought this bag?"It was sold to Prentice, who was sempstress at Geralton
and we believe it is the one in which Lady Wilmersley carried off her
jewels."Amy gave a muffled exclamation, but almost instantly she regained her
composure."If that is so, how do you connect me with it?Because it happens to
have been found here, do you accuse me of having robbed my cousin?""No, my lady, but as you spent the night of the murder in Newhaven----"

To Cyril's surprise she shuddered from head to foot.she cried, stretching out her hands as if to ward off a blow.His Lordship himself told me that you had
joined him there."It was not her Ladyship who was with me.Her Ladyship was in
Paris at the time.Thank God, thought Cyril, he had at last found
a way of saving both his love and his honour.Of a murder which was committed while you were
still in France--" asked Griggs, lifting his eyebrows incredulously.I mean I instigated it--I hated my cousin--I needed the money, so
I hired an accomplice.Of course, if you insist upon it, I shall have to
arrest you, but I don't believe you had anything more to do with the
murder than I had, and I would stake my reputation on your being as
straight a gentleman as I ever met professionally.Wait a bit, my lord,
don't be 'asty."In his excitement Griggs dropped one of his carefully
guarded aitches."You have arrived in the nick of time.Campbell cast a bewildered look at the inspector."His Lordship says that he hired an assassin to murder Lord Wilmersley.""He _shall_ believe me," cried Cyril."I alone am responsible for
Wilmersley's death.The person who actually fired the shot was nothing
but my tool.Really, Cyril, you are too ridiculous,"
exclaimed Campbell.Suddenly he caught sight of Amy, cowering in the shadow of the curtain.Cyril gave Guy a look
in which he tried to convey all that he did not dare to say.I told him you were engaged, but he says
he would like to speak to you most particular.""I don't want to see him," began Cyril."Don't be a greater fool than you can help," exclaimed Campbell."How do
you know that he has not some important news?"I took the liberty of forcing
myself upon you at this moment, my lord, because I have just learnt
certain facts which----"

"It is too late to report," interposed Cyril hastily."Why, my lord, what is the use of pretending that you had anything to do
with the murder?I hurried here to tell you that there is no further
need of your sacrificing yourself.I have found out who----"

"Shut up, I say.cried
Cyril incoherently."Don't listen to his Lordship," said Amy."We all know, of course, that
he is perfectly innocent.She
cast a keen look at Cyril."That's just it," Judson agreed.I convinced
his Lordship that Lord Wilmersley was murdered by his wife.I have come
here to tell him that I was mistaken.It is lucky that I discovered the
truth in time."His relief
was so intense that it robbed him of all power of concealment.Amy's mouth hardened into a straight, inflexible line; her eyes
narrowed."I suppose that you have some fact to support your extraordinary
assertion?"demanded Griggs, unable to hide his vexation at finding that
his rival had evidently outwitted him."Certainly, but I will say no more till I have his Lordship's
permission."I am more anxious than
any one to discover the truth.""Permit me to suggest, my lord, that it would be better if I could first
speak to you in private.""Nonsense," exclaimed Cyril impatiently."I am tired of this eternal
secrecy."Very well, only remember, I warned you.""Have you forgotten, my lord, that I told you I always had an idea that
those two Frenchmen who were staying at the Red Lion Inn, were somehow
implicated in the affair?""But what possible motive could they have had for murdering my cousin?"The detective's eyes appeared to wander aimlessly from one of his
auditors to another.She moved slowly forward, and leaning her arm on
the mantelpiece confronted the four men.The detective inclined his head and again turned towards Cyril."Having once discovered their identity, my lord, their motive was quite
apparent.""The elder," began Judson, speaking very slowly, "is Monsieur de
Brissac.For a moment Cyril was too stunned to speak.He could do nothing but
stare stupidly at the detective.He
hardly knew what he was saying.He only realised confusedly that
something within him was crying to him to save her.A wonderful light suddenly transfigured Amy's drawn face."Cyril, would you really do this for----"

"Hush!""I don't care now who knows the truth.Don't you see that she is not accountable for what
she is saying?"He had forgotten everything but that she
was a woman--his wife."I killed Lord Wilmersley," Amy repeated, as if he had not spoken, "but
I did not murder him.""Does your Ladyship expect us to believe that you happened to call at
the castle at half-past ten in the evening, and that during an amicable
conversation you accidentally shot Lord Wilmersley?""No," replied Amy contemptuously, "of course not!"If your Ladyship had not ulterior purpose in going to Newhaven, why did
you disguise yourself as a boy and live there under an assumed name?And
who is this Frenchman who posed as your brother?""Monsieur de Brissac was my lover.When we discovered that his Lordship
was employing detectives, we went to Newhaven, because we thought that
it was the last place where they would be likely to look for us.I
disguised myself to throw them off the scent.""But the description the inspector gave me of the boy did not resemble
you in the least," insisted Cyril.I merely cut off my hair and dyed it.She
snatched the black wig from her head, disclosing a short crop of reddish
curls."You have yet to explain," resumed the inspector sternly, "what took you
to Geralton in the middle of the night.Under the circumstances I should
have thought your Ladyship would hardly have cared to visit his
Lordship's relations."Ignoring Griggs, Amy turned to her husband."My going there was the purest accident," she began in a dull,
monotonous voice, almost as if she were reciting a lesson, but as she
proceeded, her excitement increased till finally she became so absorbed
in her story that she appeared to forget her hearers completely."I was
horribly restless, so we spent most of our time motoring and often
stayed out very late.I noticed that we had
stopped within a short walk of the castle.As I had never seen it except
at a distance, it occurred to me that I would like to have a nearer view
of the place.In my boy's clothes I found it fairly easy to climb the
low wall which separates the gardens from the park.Not a light was to
be seen, so, as there seemed no danger of my being discovered, I
ventured on to the terrace.As I stood there, I heard a faint cry.My
first impulse was to retrace my footsteps as quickly as possible, but
when I realised that it was a woman who was crying for help, I felt that
I must find out what was the matter.Running in the direction from which
the sound came, I turned a corner and found myself confronted by a
lighted window.The shrieks were now positively blood-curdling and there
was no doubt in my mind that some poor creature was being done to death
only a few feet away from me.The window was high above my head, but I
was determined to reach it.After several unsuccessful attempts I
managed to gain a foothold on the uneven surface of the wall and hoist
myself on to the window-sill.Luckily the window was partially open, so
I was able to slip noiselessly into the room and hide behind the
curtain.Peering through the folds, I saw a woman lying on the floor.Her bodice was torn open, exposing her bare back.Over her stood a man
who was beating her with a piece of cord which was attached to the waist
of a sort of Eastern dressing-gown he wore."'So you thought you would leave me, did you?'he cried over and over
again as the lash fell faster and faster.Not till I
send you to hell, which I will some day.'"At last he paused and wiped the perspiration from his brow.He was very
fat and his exertions were evidently telling on him.I have my pistol within reach of my
hand.Ah, you didn't know that, did you?'"The woman shuddered but made no attempt to rise."I was slowly recovering from the terror which had at first paralysed
me.I realised I must act at once if I meant to save Lady Wilmersley's
life."Dropping on my hands and knees, I crept cautiously toward it.'Kill
you, kill you, that is what I ought to do,' he kept repeating.No pistol was to be seen; yet I knew it was there.As I fumbled among his papers, my hand touched an ancient steel
gauntlet.Some instinct told me that I had found what I sought.But how
to open it was the question.Some agonising moments passed before I at
last accidentally pressed the spring and a pistol lay in my hand."He swung around and as he caught sight of the pistol levelled at his
head, the purple slowly faded from his face."Then seemingly reassured at finding that it was only a boy who
confronted him, he took a step forward.he blustered, but I noticed that his knees
shook and he made no further effort to move.There is a car waiting in the road,' I called
to the girl."I held him with my eye and saw his coward soul quiver with fear as I
moved deliberately nearer him."I knew rather than saw that she picked up a jacket and bag which lay
near the window.With a soft thud she dropped into the night.That is
the last I saw of her."As Lord Wilmersley saw his wife disappear, he gave a cry like a wounded
animal and rushed after her.He staggered back a few steps,
then turning he ran into the adjoining room.I heard a splash but did
not stop to find out what happened.Almost beside myself with terror, I
fled from the castle.If you have any more questions to ask, you had
better hurry."She stopped abruptly, trembling from head to foot, and glanced wildly
about her till her eyes rested on her husband.For a long, long moment
she regarded him in silence.She seemed to be gathering herself together
for a supreme effort.All four men watched her in breathless suspense.With her eyes still fastened on Cyril she fumbled in the bosom of her
dress, then her hand shot out, and before any one could prevent her, she
jabbed a hypodermic needle deep into her arm.cried Cyril, springing forward and wrenching the
needle from her.A beatific smile spread slowly over her face.She swayed a little and would have fallen if Cyril had not caught her."It is too late," she murmured.I--loved--you--so----"




CHAPTER XXII

CAMPBELL RESIGNS


Under a yew tree, overlooking a wide lawn, bordered on the farther side
by a bank of flowers, three people are sitting clustered around a
tea-table.One of them is a little old lady, the dearest old lady imaginable.By
her side, in a low basket chair, a girl is half sitting, half reclining.Her small figure, clad in a simple black frock, gives the impression of
extreme youth, which impression is heightened by the fact that her
curly, yellow hair, reaching barely to the nape of her neck, is caught
together by a black ribbon like a schoolgirl's.But when one looks more
closely into her pale face, one realises somehow that she is a woman and
a woman who has suffered--who still suffers.On the ground facing the younger woman a red-headed young man in white
flannels is squatting tailor-fashion.He is holding out an empty cup to
be refilled.exclaims the little old lady in a horrified tone."Why,
you have had three already!""My dear Trevie, let me inform you once and for all that I have
abandoned my figure.Why should I persist in the struggle now that Anita
refuses to smile on me?When one's heart is broken, one had better make
the most of the few pleasures one can still enjoy.Anita took no notice of his sally; her eyes were fixed on the distant
horizon; she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts."By the way," remarked Campbell casually as he sipped his tea, "I spent
last Sunday at Geralton."A faint flutter of
the eyelids was the only indication she gave of having heard him, yet
Guy was convinced that she was waiting breathlessly for him to continue.You would hardly
know it--the interior, I mean."Although he had pointedly addressed
Anita, she made no comment.It was only after a long silence that she
finally spoke.She plays all day long with the dolls Cyril bought for
her.Miss Trevor took up her knitting, which had been lying in her lap, and
was soon busy avoiding the pitfalls a heel presents to the unwary."I think I will go for a walk," said Anita, rising slowly from her seat.There was a hint of exasperation in her voice which escaped neither of
her hearers.Miss Trevor peered anxiously over her spectacles at the retreating
figure.Campbell's rubicund countenance had grown strangely grave.he asked as soon as Anita was out of earshot.Miss Trevor shook her head disconsolately.I can't imagine what can be the matter with her.She
seemed at one time to have recovered from her terrible experience.But
now, as you can see for yourself, she is absolutely wretched.She hardly eats enough to keep a bird alive.If
she goes on like this much longer, she will fret herself into her grave.Yet whenever I question her, she assures me that she is all right.I
really don't know what I ought to do.""Has it never occurred to you that she may be wondering why Wilmersley
has never written to her, nor been to see her?""She inquires after everybody
at Geralton except Cyril.Doesn't that strike you as very suspicious?""Oh, you don't mean that----"

He nodded.You told me yourself that she had only seen
him three or four times.""True, but you must remember that they met under very romantic
conditions.And Cyril is the sort of chap who would be likely to appeal
to a girl's imagination.""I wish I didn't," muttered Guy under his breath.She heard him, however, and laid her small, wrinkled hand tenderly on
his shoulder."My poor boy, I guessed your trouble long ago."It doesn't hurt any longer--not much at least.When one
realises a thing is quite hopeless, one somehow ends by adjusting
oneself to the inevitable.What I feel for her now is more worship than
love.I want above all things that she should be happy, and if Cyril can
make her so, I would gladly speed his wooing.""Do you think he has any thought of her?""Then why has he given no sign of life all these months?""I fancy he is waiting for the year of their mourning to elapse.But I
confess that I am surprised that he has been able to restrain his
impatience as long as this.Every day I have expected--"

"By Jove!"cried Campbell, springing to his feet, "there he is now!"Miss Trevor turned and saw a tall figure emerge from the house.Being plunged suddenly into the midst of romance, together with the
unexpected and dramatic arrival of the hero, was too much for the little
lady's composure.Her bag, her knitting, her glasses fell to the ground
unheeded as she rose hurriedly to receive Lord Wilmersley.Let me give you a cup of tea, or would you prefer
some whiskey and soda?"She was so flustered that she hardly knew what
she was saying.Rather fancied I
might run across you."Cyril's eyes strayed anxiously hither and thither.Cyril gave a start of guilty surprise."Yes, I was wondering where
she was.""She has gone for a little walk, but as she never leaves the grounds,
she can't be very far off," said Miss Trevor."Perhaps--" Cyril hesitated; he was painfully embarrassed."I will show you where you are likely to find
her."I did rather want to see her--ahem, on business!"jeered Campbell as he sauntered off.For a moment Cyril glared at Guy's back indignantly; then mumbling an
apology to Miss Trevor, he hastened after him.They had gone only a short distance before they espied a small,
black-robed figure coming towards them.Guy stopped short; he glanced at
Cyril, but the latter was no longer conscious of his presence.Without a
word he turned and hurriedly retraced his footsteps."Well, Trevie," he said, "I must be going.His manner was quite ostentatiously cheerful.Miss Trevor, however, was not deceived by it."You are a dear,
courageous boy," she murmured.With a flourish of his hat that seemed to repudiate all sympathy, Guy
turned on his heel and marched gallantly away.Meanwhile, in another part of the garden, a very different scene was
being enacted.On catching sight of each other Cyril and Anita had both halted
simultaneously.Cyril's heart pounded so violently that he could hardly
hear himself think."I must be calm," he said to himself.If I only had a little more time to collect my wits!I know I
shall make an ass of myself!"As these thoughts went racing through his brain, he had been moving
almost automatically forward.Already he could distinguish the soft
curve of her parted lips and the colour of her dilated eyes.He was conscious of a wild desire to fly from
her presence; but it was too late.For a moment neither moved, but under the insistence of his gaze her
eyes slowly sank before his.Then, without a word, as one who merely
claims his own, he flung his arms around her and crushed her to his
heart.THE END

_Nearly One Million copies of Mrs.This, I _am sure_, you will not do

night her husband will lock her in; I, sad with my gushing tears, will
follow her as far as I may, even to her obdurate door._And_ now will he
be snatching a kiss; _and_ now not kisses only will he snatch; you will

grant him this (you can do so) with a bad grace, and like one acting by
compulsion; let no caresses be heard; and let Venus prove inauspicious.If my wishes avail, I trust, too, that he will find no satisfaction
therein; but if otherwise, still at least let it have no delights for
you.But, however, whatever luck may attend upon the night, assure me in
positive language to-morrow, that you did not dally with him._The beauties of Corinna._

|Twas summer time, [051] and the day had passed the hour of noon; _when_ I
threw my limbs to be refreshed on the middle of the couch.A part of the
window [053] was thrown open, the other part shut; the light was such as
the woods are wont to have; just as the twilight glimmers, when Phoebus
is retreating; or _as_ when the night has gone, and still the day is not
risen.Such light should be given to the bashful fair, in which coy
modesty may hope to have concealment.Corinna [054] came, clothed in a tunic [055] hanging loose, her
flowing hair [056] covering her white neck.Beauteous Semiramis [057] is said to have entered her chamber, and Lais,
[058] beloved by many a hero.I drew aside the tunic; in its thinness
[059] it was but a small impediment; still, to be covered with the tunic
did she strive; and, as she struggled as though she was not desirous
to conquer, without difficulty was she overcome, through betrayal
of herself.When, her clothing laid aside, she stood before my eyes,
throughout her whole body nowhere was there a blemish.What shoulders,
what arms I _both_ saw and touched!The contour of her breast, how
formed was it to be pressed!How smooth her stomach beneath her
faultless bosom!How full and how beauteous her sides!How plump with
youthfulness the thigh!Nothing did I
behold not worthy of praise; and I pressed her person even to my own.May such a midday
often prove my lot._He entreats the porter to open to him the door of his mistress's
house._

Porter, fastened (_and_ how unworthily!)with the cruel fetter, [060]
throw open the stubborn door with its turning hinge.What I ask, is but
a trifle; let the door, half-opened, admit me sideways with its narrow
passage.Protracted Love has made my body thin for such an emergency,
and by diminishing my bulk, has rendered my limbs _quite_ supple.'Tis
he who shows me how to go softly amid the watches of the keepers; [062]
'tis he directs my feet that meet no harm.But, at one time, I used
to be afraid of the night and imaginary ghosts; _and_ I used to be
surprised if any one was about to go in the dark: Cupid, with his
graceful mother, laughed, so that I could hear him, and he softly said,
"Thou too wilt become bold."Without delay, love came _upon me_; then,
I feared not spectres that flit by night, [063] or hands uplifted for my
destruction.I only fear you, _thus_ too tardy; you alone do I court; you hold the
lightning by which you can effect my destruction.Look (and that you may
see, loosen the obdurate bars) how the door has been made wet with my
tears.At all events, 'twas I, who, when, your garment laid aside, you
stood ready for the whip, [064] spoke in your behalf to your mistress
as you were trembling.the credit which
once prevailed in your behalf, now fail to prevail in my own favour?Give a return for my kindness; you may _now_ be grateful.As you wish,
[065] the hours of the night pass on; [066] from the door-post [067] strike
away the bar.Strike it away then may you one day be liberated from your
long fetters and may the water of the slave [068] be not for ever drunk
of by you.you hear me, as I implore in vain; the
door, supported by its hard oaken _posts_, is still unmoved.Let the
protection of a closed gate be of value to cities when besieged; _but_
why, in the midst of peace are you dreading warfare?What would you do
to an enemy, who thus shut out the lover?The hours of the night pass
on; from the door-post strike away the bar.I am not come attended with soldiers and with arms; I should be alone,
if ruthless Love were not here.Him, even if I should desire it, I can
never send away; first should I be even severed from my limbs.Love
then, and a little wine about my temples, [069] are with me, and the
chaplet falling from off my anointed hair.Who is to dread arms _such_
as these?The hours of the night pass
on; from the door-post strike away the bar.or does sleep (who but ill befriends the lover)
give to the winds my words, as they are repelled from your ear?But, I
remember, when formerly I used to avoid you, you were awake, with the
stars of the midnight.Perhaps, too, your own mistress is now asleep
with you; alas!how much superior _then_ is your fate to my own!And
since 'tis so, pass on to me, ye cruel chains.The hours of the night
pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar.Or did the door-posts creak with the turning hinge, and
did the shaken door give the jarring signal?Yes, I am mistaken; the
door was shaken by the boisterous wind.how far away has that
gust borne my hopes!Boreas, if well thou dost keep in mind the ravished
Orithyia, come hither, and with thy blast beat open this relentless
door.'Tis silence throughout all the City; damp with the glassy dew,
the hours of the night pass on; from the door-post strike away the bar.Otherwise I, myself, [073] now better prepared _than you_, with my
sword, and with the fire which I am holding in my torch, [074] will
scale this arrogant abode.Night, and lore, and wine, [075] are
persuasive of no moderation; the first is without shame, Bacchus and
Love _are without fear_.I have expended every method; neither by entreaties nor by threats have
I moved you, O _man, even_ more deaf yourself than your door.It becomes
you not to watch the threshold of the beauteous fair; of the anxieties
of the prison, [076] are you more deserving.And now Lucifer is moving
his wheels beset with rime; and the bird is arousing [077] wretched
_mortals_ to their work.But, chaplet taken from my locks joyous no
longer, be you the livelong night upon this obdurate threshold.You,
when in the morning she shall see you _thus_ exposed, will be a witness
of my time thus thrown away._Porter_, whatever your disposition, good
bye, and _one day_ experience the pangs of him who is now departing;
sluggish one, and worthless in not admitting the lover, fare you well.And you, ye cruel door-posts, with your stubborn threshold; and _you,
ye_ doors, equally slaves, [078] hard-hearted blocks of wood, farewell._He has beaten his mistress, and endeavours to regain her favour._

|Put my hands in manacles (they are deserving of chains), if any friend
of mine is present, until all my frenzy has departed.For frenzy has
raised my rash arms against my mistress; hurt by my frantic hand, the
fair is weeping.In such case could I have done an injury even to my
dear parents, or have given unmerciful blows to even the hallowed
Gods.Why; did not Ajax, too, [080] the owner of the sevenfold shield,
slaughter the flocks that he had caught along the extended plains?And did Orestes, the guilty avenger of his father, the punisher of his
mother, dare to ask for weapons against the mystic Goddesses?[081]

And could I then tear her tresses so well arranged; and were not her
displaced locks unbecoming to my mistress?Even thus was she beauteous;
in such guise they say that the daughter of Schoeneus [082] pursued the
wild beasts of Mænalus with her bow.'Twere more fitting for her face to
be pale from the impress of kisses, and for her neck to bear the marks
of the toying teeth.In such guise did the Cretan damsel [083] weep, that the South winds, in
their headlong flight, had borne away both the promises and the sails of
the forsworn Theseus.Thus, _too_, chaste Minerva, did Cassandra [084]
fall in thy temple, except that her locks were bound with the fillet.Who did not say to me, "You madman!"who did not say _to me_, "You
barbarian!"She herself _said_ not a word; her tongue was restrained
by timid apprehensions.But still her silent features pronounced my
censure; by her tears _and_ by her silent lips did she convict me.First could I wish that my arms had fallen from off my shoulders; to
better purpose could I have parted with a portion of myself.To my own
disadvantage had I the strength of a madman; and for my own punishment
did I stoutly exert my strength.What do I want with you, ye ministers
of death and criminality?Impious hands, submit to the chains, your due.Should I not have been punished had I struck the humblest Roman [085]
of the multitude?_And_ shall I have a greater privilege against my
mistress?The son of Tydeus has left the worst instance of crime: he was
the first to strike a Goddess, [086] I, the second.But less guilty
was he; by me, she, whom I asserted to be loved _by me_, was injured;
against an enemy the son of Tydeus was infuriate.Come now, conqueror, prepare your boastful triumphs; bind your locks
with laurel, and pay your vows to Jove, and let the multitude, the
train, that escorts your chariot, shout aloud, "Io _triumphe!_ by
_this_ valiant man has the fair been conquered!"Let the captive, in her
sadness, go before with dishevelled locks, pale all over, if her hurt
cheeks [087] may allow.In short, if, after the manner of a swelling torrent, I was impelled,
and if impetuous anger did make me its prey; would it not have been
enough to have shouted aloud at the trembling girl, and not to have
thundered out my threats far too severe?Or else, to my own disgrace, to
have torn her tunic from its upper edge down to the middle?Her girdle
should, at the middle [089] have come to its aid.But now, in the
hardness of my heart, I could dare, seizing her hair on her forehead,
to mark her free-born cheeks [090] with my nails._There_ she stood,
amazed, with her features pale and bloodless, just as the marble is
cut in the Parian mountains.[091] I saw her fainting limbs, and her
palpitating members; just as when the breeze waves the foliage of the
poplars; just as the slender reed quivers with the gentle Zephyr; or,
as when the surface of the waves is skimmed by the warm South wind.Her
tears, too, so long repressed, flowed down her face, just as the water
flows from the snow when heaped up.Then, for the first time, did I begin to be sensible that I was guilty;
the tears which she was shedding were _as_ my own blood.Yet, thrice
was I ready, suppliantly to throw myself before her feet; thrice did
she repel my dreaded hands.But, _dearest,_ do not you hesitate, (_for_
revenge will lessen your grief) at once to attack my face with your
nails.Spare not my eyes, nor _yet_ my hair; let anger nerve your hands,
weak though they may be.And that tokens so shocking of my criminality may no longer exist, put
your locks, arranged anew, in their proper order.[092]




ELEGY VIII._He curses a certain procuress, whom he overhears instructing his
mistress in the arts of a courtesan._

|There is a certain--(whoever wishes to make acquaintance with a
procuress, let him listen.)--There is a certain old hag, Dipsas by name.From fact does she derive [094] her name; never in a sober state does
she behold the mother of the swarthy Memnon with her horses of roseate
hue.She knows well the magic arts, and the charms of Ææa, [095] and
by her skill she turns back to its source [096] the flowing stream.She
knows right well what the herbs, what the thrums impelled around the
whirling spinning-wheel, [097] _and_ what the venomous exudation [098]
from the prurient mare can effect.When she wills it, the clouds are
overspread throughout all the sky; when she wills it, the day is bright
with a clear atmosphere.I have beheld (if I may be believed) the stars dripping with blood:
the face of the moon was empurpled [099] with gore.I believe that she,
transformed, [101] was flying amid the shades of night, and that her
hag's carcase was covered with feathers._This_ I believe, and such is
the report.A double pupil, too, [102] sparkles in her eyes, and light
proceeds from a twofold eyeball.Forth from the ancient sepulchres she
calls our great grandsires, and their grandsires [103] as well; and with
her long incantations she cleaves the solid ground.She has made it her
occupation to violate the chaste bed; and besides, her tongue is not
"wanting in guilty advocacy.Chance made me the witness of her language;
in such words was she giving her advice; the twofold doors [105]
concealed me."You understand, my life, how greatly you yesterday pleased a wealthy
young man; _for_ he stopped short, and stood gazing for some time on
your face.Your beauty is inferior to no
one's.I _only_
wish you were as well off, as you are distinguished for beauty; if
you became rich, I should not be poor.The adverse star of Mars in
opposition [106] was unfortunate for you; Mars has gone; now Venus is
befriending you with her planet.See now how favourable she is on her
approach; a rich lover is sighing for you, and he makes it his care
[107] what are your requirements.He has good looks, too, that may
compare with your own; if he did not wish to have you at a price, he
were worthy himself to be purchased."_On this the damsel_ blushed: [108] "Blushing," _said the hag_, "suits a
faircomplexion indeed; but if you _only_ pretend it, 'tis an advantage;
_if_ real, it is wont to be injurious.When, your eyes cast down, [109]
you are looking full upon your bosom, each man must _only_ be looked at
in the proportion in which he offers.Possibly the sluttish Sabine
females, [111] when Tati us was king, were unwilling to be accommodating
to more men _than one_.Now-a-days, Mars employs the bravery _of our
men_ in foreign warfare; [112] but Venus holds sway in the City of her
own Æneas.Enjoy yourselves, my pretty ones; she is chaste, whom nobody
has courted; or else, if coyness does not prevent her, she herself is
the wooer.Dispel these frowns [113] as well, which you are carrying
upon your lofty brow; with those frowns will numerous failings be
removed.Penelope used to try [114] the strength of the young men upon
the bow; the bow that tested _the strength_ of their sides, was made of
horn.Age glides stealthily on, and beguiles us as it flies; just as the
swift river glides onward with its flowing waters.Brass grows bright by
use; good clothes require to be worn; uninhabited buildings grow white
with nasty mould.Unless you entertain _lovers_, beauty _soon_ waxes
old, with no one to enjoy it; and _even_ one or two _lovers_ are not
sufficiently profitable.From many _of them_, gain is more sure, and not
so difficult to be got.An abundant prey falls to the hoary wolves out
of a _whole_ flock.what does this poet of yours make you a present of besides his
last verses?You will read many thousands of them by _this_ new lover.The God himself of poets, graceful in his mantle [116] adorned with
gold, strikes the harmonious strings of the gilded lyre.He that shall
make you presents, let him be to you greater than great Homer; believe
me, it is a noble thing to give.And, if there shall be any one redeemed
at a price for his person [117], do not you despise him; the fault of
having the foot rubbed with chalk [118] is a mere trifle.Neither let
the old-fashioned wax busts about the halls [119] take you in; pack
off with your forefathers, you needy lover.Nay more, should [120] one,
because he is good-looking, ask for a night without a present; _why_,
let him first solicit his own admirer for something to present to you."Be less exacting of presents, while you are laying your nets, _for
fear_ lest they should escape you: _once_ caught, tease them at your
own pleasure.Pretended affection, too, is not a bad thing; let him
fancy he is loved; but have you a care that this affection is not all
for nothing.Often refuse your favours; sometimes pretend a head-ache;
and sometimes there will be Isis [121] to afford a pretext._But_ soon
admit him again; that he may acquire no habits of endurance, and that
his love, so often repulsed, may not begin to flag.Let your door be
deaf to him who entreats, open to him who brings.Let the lover that is
admitted, hear the remarks of him who is excluded.And, as though you
were the first injured, sometimes get in a passion with him when injured
_by you_.His censure, when counterbalanced by your censure, [127] may
wear away.But do you never afford a long duration for anger; prolonged
anger frequently produces hatred.Moreover, let your eyes learn, at
discretion, to shed tears; and let this cause or that cause your cheeks
to be wet.And do not, if you deceive any one, hesitate to be guilty of
perjury; Venus lends _but_ a deaf hearing [128] to deceived _lovers_."Let a male servant and a crafty handmaid [129] be trained up to their
parts; who may instruct him what may be conveniently purchased for you.And let them ask but little for themselves; if they ask a little of
many, [130] very soon, great will be the heap from the gleanings.[131]
Let your sister, and your mother, and your nurse as well, fleece your
admirer.A booty is soon made, that is sought by many hands.When
occasions for asking for presents shall fail you, call attention with a
cake [132] to your birthday Take care that no one loves you in security,
without a rival; love is not very lasting if you remove _all_ rivalry.Let him perceive the traces of _another_ person on the couch; all your
neck, too, discoloured by the marks of toying.Especially let him see
the presents, which another has sent.If he gives you nothing, the
Sacred Street [133] must be talked about.When you have received many
things, but yet he has not given you every thing, be continually asking
him to lend you something, for you never to return.Let your tongue aid
you, and let it conceal your thoughts; [134] caress him, and prove his
ruin.[135] Beneath the luscious honey cursed poisons lie concealed.If
you observe these precepts, tried by me throughout a long experience; and
if the winds and the breezes do not bear away my words; often will you
bless me while I live; often will you pray, when I am dead, that in
quietude my bones may repose.".She was in the middle of her speech, when my shadow betrayed me; but my
hands with difficulty refrained from tearing her grey scanty locks, and
her eyes bleared with wine, and her wrinkled cheeks.May the Gods grant
you both no home, [136] and a needy old age; prolonged winters as well,
and everlasting thirst._He tells Atticus that like the soldier, the lover ought to be on his
guard and that Love is a species of warfare._

|Every lover is a soldier, and Cupid has a camp of his own; believe me,
Atticus, [138] every lover is a soldier.The age which is fitted for
war, is suited to love as well.For an old man to be a soldier, is
shocking; amorousness in an old man is shocking.The years which [139]
generals require in the valiant soldier, the same does the charming fair
require in her husband.Both _soldier and lover_ pass sleepless nights;
both rest upon the ground.The one watches at the door of his mistress;
but the other _at that_ of his general.[140] Long marches are the duty
of the soldier; send the fair _far_ away, _and_ the lover will boldly
follow her, without a limit _to his endurance_.Over opposing mountains
will he go, and rivers swollen with rains; the accumulating snows will
he pace.About to plough the waves, he will not reproach the stormy East winds;
nor will he watch for Constellations favourable for scudding over the
waves.Who, except either the soldier or the lover, will submit to both
the chill of the night, and the snows mingled with the heavy showers?The one is sent as a spy against the hostile foe; the other keeps
his eye on his rival, as though upon an enemy.The one lays siege to
stubborn cities, the other to the threshold of his obdurate mistress:
the one bursts open gates, and the other, doors.[142] Full oft has it
answered to attack the enemy when buried in sleep; and to slaughter an
unarmed multitude with armed hand.Thus did the fierce troops of the
Thracian Rhesus [143] fall; and you, captured steeds, forsook your lord.Full oft do lovers take advantage of the sleep of husbands, and brandish
their arms against the slumbering foe.To escape the troops of the
sentinels, and the bands of the patrol, is the part _both_ of the
soldier, and of the lover always in misery.Mars is wayward, and Venus
is uncertain; both the conquered rise again, and those fall whom you
would say could never possibly be prostrate.Whoever, then, has pronounced Love _mere_ slothfulness, let him cease
_to love_: [144] to the discerning mind does Love belong.The mighty
Achilles is inflamed by the captive Briseis.Trojans, while you may,
destroy the Argive resources.Hector used to go to battle _fresh_ from
the embraces of Andromache; and it was his wife who placed his helmet on
his head.The son of Atreus, the first of _all_ the chiefs, on beholding
the daughter of Priam, is said to have been smitten with the dishevelled
locks of the raving _prophetess_.[146] Mars, too, when caught, was
sensible of the chains wrought at the forge; [147] there was no story
better known than his, in all the heavens.I myself was of slothful habit, and born for a lazy inactivity; [148]
the couch and the shade [149] had enervated my mind.Attentions to the
charming fair gave a fillip to me, in my indolence; and _Love_ commanded
me to serve [150] in his camp.Hence it is that thou seest me active,
and waging the warfare by night.Let him who wishes not to become
slothful, fall in love._He tells his mistress that she ought not to require presents as a
return for her love._

|Such as she, who, borne away from the Eurotas, [151] in the Phrygian
ships, was the cause of warfare to her two husbands; such as Leda was,
whom her crafty paramour, concealed in his white feathers, deceived
under _the form of_ a fictitious bird; such as Amymone [152] used to
wander in the parched _fields of_ Argos, when the urn was pressing the
locks on the top of her head; such were you; and I was in dread of both
the eagle and the bull with respect to you, and whatever _form besides_
Love has created of the mighty Jove.Now, all fears are gone, and the disease of my mind is cured; and now no
longer does that form _of yours_ rivet my eyes._It is_, because you require presents.This reason does not
allow of your pleasing me.So long as you were disinterested, I was in
love with your mind together with your person; now, _in my estimation_
your appearance is affected by this blemish on your disposition.Love is
both a child and naked; he has years without sordidness, and _he wears_
no clothes, that he may be without concealment.Why do you require the
son of Venus to be prostituted at a price?He has no fold in his dress,
[153] in which to conceal that price.Neither Venus is suited for cruel
arms, nor yet the son of Venus; it befits not such unwarlike Divinities
to serve for pay.The courtesan stands for hire to any one at a certain
price; and with her submissive body, she seeks for wretched pelf.Still,
she curses the tyranny of the avaricious procurer; [154] and she does by
compulsion [155] what you are doing of your own free will.Take, as an example, the cattle, devoid of reason; it were a shocking
thing for there to be a finer feeling in the brutes.The mare asks no
gift of the horse, nor the cow of the bull; the ram does not woo the
ewe, induced by presents.Woman alone takes pleasure in spoils torn
from the man; she alone lets out her nights; alone is she on sale, to be
hired at a price.She sells, too, _joys_ that delight them both, _and_
which both covet; and she makes it a _matter_ of pay, at what price she
herself is to be gratified.Those joys, which are so equally sweet to
both, why does the one sell, and _why_ the other buy them?Why must that
delight prove a loss to me, to you a gain, for which the female and the
male combine with kindred impulse?Witnesses hired dishonestly, [156]
sell their perjuries; the chest [157] of the commissioned judge [158] is
disgracefully open _for the bribe_.'Tis a dishonourable thing to defend the wretched criminals with a
tongue that is purchased; [159] 'tis a disgrace for a tribunal to
make great acquisitions.'Tis a disgrace for a woman to increase
her patrimonial possessions by the profits of her embraces, and to
prostitute her beauty for lucre.Thanks are _justly_ due for things
obtained without purchase; there are no thanks for an intercourse
disgracefully bartered.He who hires, [160] pays all _his due_; the
price _once_ paid, he no longer remains a debtor for your acquiescence.Cease, ye beauties, to bargain for pay for your favours.Sordid gains
bring no good results.It was not worth her while to bargain for the
Sabine bracelets, [161] in order that the arms should crush the head of
the sacred maiden.The son pierced [163] with the sword those entrails
from which he had sprung, and a simple necklace [164] was the cause of
the punishment.But yet it is not unbecoming for a present to be asked of the wealthy
man; he has something to give to her who does ask for a present.Pluck
the grapes that hang from the loaded vines; let the fruitful soil of
Alcinous [165] afford the apples.Let the needy man proffer duty, zeal,
and fidelity; what each one possesses, let him bestow it all upon his
mistress.My endowments, too, are in my lines to shig the praises of
those fair who deserve them; she, whom I choose, becomes celebrated
through my skill.Vestments will rend, gems and gold will spoil; the
fame which poesy confers is everlasting._Still_ I do not detest giving and revolt at it, but at being asked for
a price.Cease to demand it, _and_ I will give you that which I refuse
you while you ask._He begs Nape to deliver his letter to her mistress, and commences by
praising her neatness and dexterity, and the interest she has hitherto
manifested in his behalf._

|Nape, skilled at binding the straggling locks [166] and arranging
them in order, and not deserving to be reckoned [167] among the
female slaves; _known_, too, _by experience_ to be successful in the
contrivances of the stealthy night, and clever in giving the signals;
[168] you who have so oft entreated Corinna, when hesitating, to come to
me; who have been found so often faithful by me in my difficulties; take
and carry these tablets, [169] so well-filled, [170] this morning
to your mistress; and by your diligence dispel _all_ impeding delay.Neither veins of flint, nor hard iron is in your breast, nor have you a
simplicity greater than that of your _clever_ class.There is no doubt
that you, too, have experienced the bow of Cupid; in my behalf defend
the banner of your service.If _Corinna_ asks what I am doing, you will
say that I am living in expectation of the night.The wax inscribed with
my persuasive hand is carrying the rest.While I am speaking, time is flying; opportunely give her my tablets,
when she is at leisure; but still, make her read them at once.I bid you
watch her eyes and her forehead as she reads; from the silent features
we may know the future.And _be there_ no delay; when she has read them
through, request her to write a long answer; [172] I hate it, when the
bleached wax is empty, with a margin on every side.Let her write the
lines close as they run, and let the letters traced in the extreme
margin long detain my eyes._But_ what need is there for wearying her fingers with holding the pen?[175] Let the whole of her letter contain this one word, "Come."Then,
I should not delay to crown my victorious tablets with laurel, nor to
place them in the midst of the temple of Venus.Beneath them I would
inscribe "Naso consecrates these faithful servants of his to Venus; but
lately, you were pieces of worthless maple."[176]




ELEGY XII._He curses the tablets which he has sent, because his mistress has
written an answer on them, in which she refuses to grant his request._

|Lament my misfortune; my tablets have returned to me with sad
intelligence.Her unlucky letter announces that she cannot _be seen_
to-day.There is something in omens; just now, when she was preparing
to go, Napè stopped short, having struck her foot [178] against the
threshold.When sent out of doors another time, remember to pass the
threshold more carefully, and _like_ a sober woman lift your foot high
_enough._

Away with you; obdurate tablets, fatal bits of board; and you wax, as
well, crammed with the lines of denial.I doubt the Corsican bee [180]
has sent you collected from the blossom of the tall hemlock, beneath its
abominable honey.Besides, you were red, as though you had been thoroughly dyed in
vermilion; [181] such a colour is exactly that of blood.Useless bits of
board, thrown out in the street, _there_ may you lie; and may the weight
of the wheel crush you, as it passes along.I could even prove that he
who formed you to shape from the tree, had not the hands of innocence.That tree surely has afforded a gibbet for some wretched neck, _and_ has
supplied the dreadful crosses [182] for the executioner.It has given a
disgusting shelter to the screeching owls; in its branches it has borne
the eggs of the vulture and of the screech-owl.[183] In my madness,
have I entrusted my courtship to these, and have I given soft words to
be _thus_ carried to my mistress?These tablets would more becomingly hold the prosy summons, [184] which
some judge [185] pronounces, with his sour face._He entreats the morning not to hasten on with its usual speed._

|Now over the Ocean does she come from her aged husband _Tithonus_,
who, with her yellow locks, brings on the day with her frosty chariot.Whither, Aurora, art thou hastening?Stay; _and_ then may the yearly
bird, with its wonted death, honour the shades [189] of thy Memnon, its
parent.Now do I delight to recline in the soft arms of my mistress;
now, if ever, is she deliciously united to my side.Now, too, slumbers
are sound, and now the moisture is cooling the birds, too, are sweetly
waronng with their little throats.Whither art thou hastening, hated by
the men, detested by the fair?Check thy dewy reins with thy rosy hand.[190]

Before thy rising, the sailor better observes his Constellations; and
he wanders not in ignorance, in the midst of the waves.On thy approach,
the wayfarer arises, weary though he be; the soldier lays upon his arms
the hands used to bear them.Thou art the first to look upon the tillers
of the fields laden with the two-pronged fork; thou art the first to
summon the lagging oxen to the crooked yoke.'Tis thou who dost deprive
boys of their sleep, and dost hand them over to their masters; [192],
that their tender hands may suffer the cruel stripes.[193] 'Tis thou,
too, who dost send the man before the vestibule of the attorney, [194]
when about to become bail; [195] that he may submit to the great risks
of a single word.Thou art no source of pleasure to the pleader, [198] nor yet to the
counsel; for fresh combats each is forced to rise.Thou, when the
labours of the females might have had a pause, dost recal the hand of
the worker in wool to its task.All _this_ I could endure; but who could allow the fair to arise _thus_
early, except _the man_ who has no mistress of his own?How often have
I wished that night would not make way for thee; and that the stars when
put to flight would not fly from thy countenance.Many a time have I
wished that either the wind would break thy chariot to pieces, or that
thy steed would fall, overtaken by _some_ dense cloud.Remorseless one,
whither dost thou hasten?Inasmuch as thy son was black, such was the
colour of his mother's heart.What if [199] she had not once burned with
passion for Cephalus?Or does she fancy that her escapade was not known?I _only_ wish it was allowed Tithonus to tell of thee; there would not
be a more coarse tale in _all_ the heavens.While thou art avoiding him,
because he is chilled by length of years, thou dost rise early in the
morning from _the bed of_ the old man to thy odious chariot.But if thou
wast _only_ holding some Cephalus embraced in thy arms; _then_ wouldst
thou be crying out, "Run slowly on, ye horses of the night."Why should I be punished in my affections, if thy husband does decay
through _length of_ years?Wast thou married to the old fellow by my
contrivance?See how many hours of sleep the Moon gave [201] to the
youth beloved by _her_; and yet her beauty is not inferior to thine.The
parent of the Gods himself, that he might not see thee so often, joined
two nights together [202] for _the attainment of_ his desires.I had finished my reproaches; you might be sure she heard them; _for_
she blushed'.However, no later than usual did the day arise._His mistress having been in the habit of dyeing her hair with noxious
compositions, she has nearly lost it, becoming almost bald.He reminds
her of his former advice, and entreats her to abstain from the practice,
on which there may be a chance of her recovering it._

|I always used to say; "Do leave off doctoring your hair."[203] _And_
now you have no hair _left_, that you can be dyeing.But, if you had let
it alone, what was more plenteous than it?It used to reach down your
sides, so far as ever [204] they extend.And besides: Was it not so
fine, that you were afraid to dress [205] it; just like the veils [206]
which the swarthy Seres use?Or _like_ the thread which the spider draws
out with her slender legs, when she fastens her light work beneath the
neglected beam?And yet its colour was not black, nor yet was it golden,
but though it was neither, it was a mixture of them both.A _colour_,
such as the tall cedar has in the moist vallies of craggy Ida, when its
bark is stript off.Besides, it was _quite_ tractable, and falling into a thousand ringlets;
and it was the cause of no trouble to you.Neither the bodkin, [208] nor
the tooth of the comb _ever_ tore it; your tire woman always had a whole
skin.Many a time was it dressed before my eyes; and _yet_, never did
the bodkin [210] seized make wounds in her arms.Many a time too, in the
morning, her locks not yet arranged, was she lying on the purple couch,
with her face half upturned.Then even, unadorned, was she beauteous; as
when the Thracian Bacchanal, in her weariness, throws herself carelessly
upon the green grass.Still, fine as it was, and just like down, what
evils, alas!How patiently did it submit
itself to the iron and the fire; [211] that the curls might become crisp
with their twisting circlets."'Tis a shame," I used to cry, "'tis a
shame, to be burning that hair; naturally it is becoming; do, cruel one,
be merciful to your own head.Away with all violence from it; it is not
_hair_ that deserves to be scorched; the very locks instruct [212] the
bodkins when applied."Those beauteous locks are gone; which Apollo might have longed for,
_and_ which Bacchus might have wished to be on his own head.With them
I might compare those, which naked Dione is painted [213] as once having
held up with her dripping hand.Why are you complaining that hair so
badly treated is gone?Why, silly girl, do you lay down the mirror [214]
with disconsolate hand?You are not seen to advantage by yourself with
eyes accustomed _to your former self._ For you to please, you ought to
be forgetful of your _former_ self.No enchanted herbs of a rival [215] have done you this injury; no
treacherous hag has been washing you with Itæmonian water.The effects,
too, of no disease have injured you; (far away be all _bad_ omens;
[216]) nor has an envious tongue thinned your abundant locks;'twas your
own self who gave the prepared poison to your head.Now Germany will be
sending [217] for you her captured locks; by the favour of a conquered
race you will be adorned.how many a time will you have to blush, as
any one admires your hair; and _then_ you will say, "Now I am receiving
praise for a bought commodity!In place of myself, he is now bepraising
some Sygambrian girl [218] unknown to me; still, I remember _the time_
when that glory was my own."with difficulty does she restrain her tears; and she
covers her face with her hand, having her delicate cheeks suffused with
blushes.She is venturing to look at her former locks, _placed_ in her
bosom; a treasure, alas![219]

Calm your feelings with your features; the loss may still be repaired.Before long, you will become beauteous with your natural hair._He tells the envious that the fame of Poets is immortal, and that
theirs is not a life devoted to idleness._

|Why, gnawing Envy, dost thou blame me for years of slothfulness; and
_why_ dost thou call poesy the employment of an idle mind?_Thou sayest_
that I do not, after the manner of my ancestors, while vigorous years
allow me, seek the prizes of warfare covered with dust; that I do not
make myself acquainted with the prosy law, and that I have not let my
tongue for hire [221] in the disagreeable courts of justice.The pursuits of which thou art speaking, are perishable; by me,
everlasting fame is sought; that to all time I may be celebrated
throughout the whole world.The Mæonian bard [222] will live, so long as
Tenedos and Ida [223] shall stand; so long as Simois shall roll down to
the sea his rapid waves.The Ascræan, too, [224] will live, so long as
the grape shall swell with its juices; [225] so long as the corn shall
fall, reaped by the curving sickle.The son of Battus [226] will to all
time be sung throughout the whole world; although he is not powerful in
genius, in his skill he shows his might.No mischance will _ever_ come
to the _tragic_ buskin [227] of Sophocles; with the Sun and Moon Aratus
[228] will ever exist.So long as the deceitful slave, [229] the harsh
father, the roguish procuress, and the cozening courtesan shall endure,
Menander will exist.Ennius, [230] without any _art_, and Accius, [231]
with his spirited language, have a name that will perish with no lapse
of time.What age is to be forgetful of Varro, [232] and the first ship _that
sailed_, and of the golden fleece sought by the chief, the son of Æson?Then will the verses perish of the sublime Lucretius, [233] when the
same day shall give the world to destruction.Tityrus, [234] and the
harvests, and the arms of Æneas, will be read of, so long as thou, Rome,
[235] shalt be the ruler of the conquered earth.So long as the flames
and the bow shall be the arms of Cupid, thy numbers, polished Tibullus,
[236] will be repeated.Gallus [237] _will be known_ by the West, and
Gallus _known_ by the East, [238] and with Gallus will his Lycoris be
known.Though flint-stones, then, _and_ though the share of the enduring
plough perish by lapse of time, _yet_ poetry is exempt from death.Let monarchs and the triumphs of monarchs yield to poesy, and let the
wealthy shores of the golden Tagus [239] yield.Let the vulgar throng admire worthless things; let the yellow-haired
Apollo supply for me cups filled from the Castalian stream; let me bear,
too, on my locks the myrtle that dreads the cold; and let me often be
read by the anxious lover.Envy feeds upon the living; after death it is
at rest, when his own reward protects each according to his merit.Still
then, when the closing fire [240] shall have consumed me, shall I live
on; and a great portion of myself will _ever_ be surviving.BOOK THE SECOND




ELEGY I._He says that he is obliged by Cupid to write of Love instead of the
Wars, of the Giants, upon which subject he had already commenced._

|This work, also, I, Naso, born among the watery Peligni, [301]
have composed, the Poet of my own failings.This work, too, has Love
demanded.Afar hence, be afar hence, ye prudish matrons; you are not a
fitting audience for my wanton lines.Let the maiden that is not cold,
read me in the presence of her betrothed; the inexperienced boy, too,
wounded by a passion hitherto unknown; and may some youth, now wounded
by the bow by which I am, recognise the conscious symptoms of his flame;
and after long wondering, may he exclaim, "Taught by what informant, has
this Poet been composing my own story?"I was (I remember) venturing to sing of the battles of the heavens,
and Gyges [302] with his hundred hands; and I had sufficient power of
expression; what time the Earth so disgracefully avenged herself, and
lofty Ossa, heaped upon Olympus, bore Pelion headlong downwards.Having
the clouds in my hands, and wielding the lightnings with Jove, which
with success he was to hurl in behalf of his realms of the heavens, my
mistress shut her door against me; the lightnings together with Jove did
I forsake.Pardon me, O
Jove; no aid did thy weapons afford me; the shut door was a more potent
thunderbolt than thine.I forthwith resumed the language of endearment
and trifling Elegies, those weapons of my own; and gentle words
prevailed upon the obdurate door.Verses bring down [303] the horns of the blood-stained Moon; and they
recall the snow-white steeds of the Sun in his career.Through verses do
serpents burst, their jaws rent asunder, and the water turned back flows
upward to its source.Through verses have doors given way; and by verses
[304] was the bar, inserted in the door-post, although 'twas made of
oak, overcome.Of what use is the swift Achilles celebrated by me?What
can this or that son of Atreus do for me?He, too, who wasted as many of
his years in wandering as in warfare?And the wretched Hector, dragged
by the Hæmonian steeds?But the charms of the beauteous fair being
ofttimes sung, she presents herself to the Poet as the reward of his
verse.This great recompense is given; farewell, then, ye illustrious
names of heroes; your favour is of no use to me.Ye charming fair, turn
your eyes to my lines, which blushing Cupid dictates to me._He has seen a lady walking in the portico of the temple of Apollo, and
has sent to know if he may wait upon her.She has replied that it is
quite impossible, as the eunuch Bagous is set to watch her.Ovid here
addresses Bagous, and endeavours to persuade him to relax his watch over
the fair; and shows him how he can do so with safety._

|Bagous, [305] with whom is the duty of watching over your mistress,
give me your attention, while I say a few but suitable words to you.Yesterday morning I saw a young lady walking in that portico which
contains the choir _of the daughters_ of Danaus.[306] At once, as she
pleased me, I sent _to her_, and in my letter I proffered my request;
with trembling hand, she answered me, "I cannot."And to my inquiry, why
she could not, the cause was announced; _namely_, that your surveillance
over your mistress is too strict.O keeper, if you are wise (believe me _now_), cease to deserve my
hatred; every one wishes him gone, of whom he stands in dread.Her
husband, too, is not in his senses; for who would toil at taking care of
that of which no part is lost, even if you do not watch it?But _still_,
in his madness, let him indulge his passion; and let him believe that
the object is chaste which pleases universally.By your favour, liberty
may by stealth be given to her; that _one day_ she may return to you
what you have given her.Are you ready to be a confidant; the mistress
is obedient to the slave.You fear to be an accomplice; you may shut
your eyes.Does she read a letter by herself; suppose her mother to have
sent it.Does a stranger come; bye and bye let him go, [307] _as though_
an _old_ acquaintance.Should she go to visit a sick female friend, who
is not sick; in your opinion, let her be unwell.If she shall be a long
time at the sacrifice, [308] let not the long waiting tire you; putting
your head on your breast, you can snore away.And don't be enquiring
what can be going on at _the temple of_ the linen-clad Isis; [309] nor
do you stand in any fear _whatever_ of the curving theatres.An accomplice in the escapade will receive everlasting honour; and what
is less trouble than _merely_ to hold your tongue?He is in favour; he
turns the house [310] upside down _at his pleasure_, and he feels no
stripes; he is omnipotent; the rest, a scrubby lot, are grovelling on.By him, that the real circumstances may be concealed, false ones are
coined; and both the masters approve [311] of, what one, _and that the
mistress_, Approves of.When the husband has quite contracted his brow,
and has pursed up his wrinkles, the caressing fair makes him become just
as she pleases.But still, let her sometimes contrive some fault against
you even, and let her pretend tears, and call you an executioner.[312]
Do you, on the other hand, making some charge which she may easily
explain; by a feigned accusation remove all suspicion of the truth.[313] In such case, may your honours, then may your limited savings
[314] increase; _only_ do this, and in a short time you shall be a free
man.You behold the chains bound around the necks of informers; [315] the
loathsome gaol receives the hearts that are unworthy of belief.In the
midst of water Tantalus is in want of water, and catches at the apples
as they escape him; 'twas his blabbing tongue caused this.[325] While
the keeper appointed by Juno, [326] is watching Io too carefully, he
dies before his time; she becomes a Goddess.I have seen him wearing fetters on his bruised legs, through whom a
husband was obliged to know of an intrigue.The punishment was less than
his deserts; an unruly tongue was the injury of the two; the husband
was grieved; the female suffered the loss of her character.Believe me;
accusations are pleasing to no husband, and no one do they delight,
even though he should listen to them.If he is indifferent, then you are
wasting your information upon ears that care nothing for it; if he dotes
_on her_, by your officiousness is he made wretched.Besides, a faux pas, although discovered, is not so easily proved; she
comes _before him_, protected by the prejudices of her judge.Should
even he himself see it, still he himself will believe her as she denies
it; and he will condemn his own eyesight, and will impose upon himself.Let him _but_ see the tears of his spouse, and he himself will weep, and
he will say, "That blabbing fellow shall be punished."How unequal the
contest in which you embark!if conquered, stripes are ready for you;
_while_ she is reposing in the bosom of the judge.No crime do we meditate; we meet not for mixing poisons; my hand is
not glittering with the drawn sword.We ask that through you we may be
enabled to love in safety; what can there be more harmless than these
our prayers?_He again addresses Bagous, who has proved obdurate to his request, and
tries to effect his object by sympathising with his unhappy fate._

|Alas!that, [327] neither man nor woman, you are watching your
mistress, and that you cannot experience the mutual transports of love!He who was the first to mutilate boys, [328] ought himself to have
suffered those wounds which he made.You would be ready to accommodate,
and obliging to those who entreat you, had your own passion been before
inflamed by any fair.You were not born for _managing_ the steed, nor
_are you_ skilful in valorous arms; for your right hand the warlike
spear is not adapted.With these let males meddle; do you resign _all_
manly aspirations; may the standard be borne [329] by you in the cause
of your mistress.Overwhelm her with your favours; her gratitude may be of use to you.If
you should miss that, what good fortune will there be for you?She has
both beauty, _and_ her years are fitted for dalliance; her charms are
not deserving to fade in listless neglect.Ever watchful though you are
deemed, _still_ she may deceive you; what two persons will, does not
fail of accomplishment.Still, as it is more convenient to try you
with our entreaties, we do implore you, while you have _still_ the
opportunity of conferring your favours to advantage.[330]




ELEGY IV._He confesses that he is an universal admirer of the fair sex._

|I would not presume to defend my faulty morals, and to wield deceiving
arms in behalf of my frailties.I confess them, if there is any use
in confessing one's errors; and now, having confessed, I am foolishly
proceeding to my own accusation.I hate _this state_; nor, though I
wish, can I be otherwise than what I hate.how hard it is to bear
_a lot_ which you wish to lay aside!For strength and self-control fail
me for ruling myself; just like a ship carried along the rapid tide, am
I hurried away.There is no single style of beauty which inflames my passion; there are
a hundred causes for me always to be in love.Is there any fair one that casts down her modest eyes?I am on fire; and
that very modesty becomes an ambush against me.Is another one forward;
_then_ I am enchanted, because she is not coy; and her liveliness raises
all my expectations.If another seems to be prudish, and to imitate the
repulsive Sabine dames; [332] I think that she is kindly disposed, but
that she conceals it in her stateliness.[333] Or if you are a learned
fair, you please me, _thus_ endowed with rare acquirements; or if
ignorant, you are charming for your simplicity.Is there one who says
that the lines of Callimachus are uncouth in comparison with mine; at
once she, to whom I am _so_ pleasing, pleases me.Is there even one who
abuses both myself, the Poet, and my lines; I could wish to have her who
so abuses me, upon my knee.Does this one walk leisurely, she enchants
me with her gait; is another uncouth, still, she may become more gentle,
on being more intimate with the other sex.Because this one sings _so_ sweetly, and modulates her voice [334] with
such extreme case, I could wish to steal a kiss from her as she sings.Another is running through the complaining strings with active finger;
who could not fall in love with hands so skilled?_And now_, one
pleases by her gestures, and moves her arms to time, [335] and moves her
graceful sides with languishing art _in the dance_; to say nothing about
myself, who am excited on every occasion, put Hippolytus [336] there; he
would become a Priapus.You, because you are so tall, equal the Heroines
of old; [337] and, of large size, you can fill the entire couch as you
lie.Another is active from her shortness; by both I am enchanted; both
tall and short suit my taste.Is one unadorned; it occurs what addition
there might be if she was adorned.Is one decked out; she sets out her
endowments to advantage.The blonde will charm me; the brunette [338]
will charm me _too_; a Venus is pleasing, even of a swarthy colour.Does
black hair fall upon a neck of snow; Leda was sightly, with her raven
locks.Is the hair flaxen; with her saffron locks, Aurora was charming.To every traditional story does my passion adapt itself.A youthful age
charms me; _an age_ more mature captivates me; the former is superior in
the charms of person, the latter excels in spirit.In fine, whatever the fair any person approves of in all the City, to
all these does my passion aspire._He addresses his mistress, whom he has detected acting falsely towards
him._

|Away with thee, quivered Cupid: no passion is of a value so great, that
it should so often be my extreme wish to die.It is my wish to die,
as oft as I call to mind your guilt.to be a
never-ceasing cause of trouble!It is no tablets rubbed out [339]
that discover your doings; no presents stealthily sent reveal your
criminality.would that I might so accuse you, that, _after all_,
I could not convict you!_and_ why is my case so stare?Happy _the man_ who boldly dares to defend the object which he loves;
to whom his mistress is able to say, "I have done nothing _wrong_."Hard-hearted _is he_, and too much does he encourage his own grief, by
whom a blood-stained victory is sought in the conviction of the accused.To my sorrow, in my sober moments, with the wine on table, [342] I
myself was witness of your criminality, when you thought I was asleep.I saw you _both_ uttering many an expression by moving your eyebrows;
[343] in your nods there was a considerable amount of language.Your
eyes were not silent, [344] the table, too, traced over with wine;
[345] nor was the language of the fingers wanting; I understood your
discourse, [346] which treated of that which it did not appear to do;
the words, too, preconcerted to stand for certain meanings.And now, the
tables removed, many a guest had gone away; a couple of youths _only_
were _there_ dead drunk.But then I saw you _both_ giving wanton kisses;
I am sure that there was billing enough on your part; such, _in fact_,
as no sister gives to a brother of correct conduct, but _rather such_
as some voluptuous mistress gives to the eager lover; such as we may
suppose that Phoebus did not give to Diana, but that Venus many a time
save to her own _dear_ Mars.I cried out; "whither are you taking those
transports that belong to me?On what belongs to myself, I will lay the
hand of a master, [347] These _delights_ must be in common with you and
me, _and_ with me and you; _but_ why does any third person take a share
in them?"This did I say; and what, _besides_, sorrow prompted my tongue to say;
but the red blush of shame rose on her conscious features; just as the
sky, streaked by the wife of Tithonus, is tinted with red, or the
maiden when beheld by her new-made husband; [348] just as the roses are
beauteous when mingled among their _encircling_ lilies; or when the
Moon is suffering from the enchantment of her steeds; [349] or the Assyrian
ivory [350] which the Mæonian woman has stained, [351] that from length
of time it may not turn yellow.That complexion _of hers_ was extremely
like to these, or to some one of these; and, as it happened, she never
was more beauteous _than then_.She looked towards the ground; to look
upon the ground, added a charm; sad were her features, in her sorrow was
she graceful.I had been tempted to tear her locks just as they were,
(and nicely dressed they were) and to make an attack upon her tender
cheeks.When I looked on her face, my strong arms fell powerless; by arms of
her own was my mistress defended.I, who the moment before had been so
savage, _now_, as a suppliant and of my own accord, entreated that she
would give me kisses not inferior _to those given-to my rival_.She
smiled, and with heartiness she gave me her best _kisses_; such as might
have snatched his three-forked bolts from Jove.To my misery I am _now_
tormented, lest that other person received them in equal perfection; and
I hope that those were not of this quality.[352]

Those _kisses,_ too, were far better than those which I taught her; and
she seemed to have learned something new.That they were too delightful,
is a bad sign; that so lovingly were your lips joined to mine, _and_
mine to yours.And yet, it is not at this alone that I am grieved; I do
not only complain that kisses were given; although I do complain as well
that they were given; such could never have been taught but on a closer
acquaintanceship.I know not who is the master that has received a
remuneration so ample._He laments the death of the parrot which he had given to Corinna._

|The parrot, the imitative bird [353] sent from the Indians of the East,
is dead; come in flocks to his obsequies, ye birds.Come, affectionate
denizens of air, and beat your breasts with your wings; and with your
hard claws disfigure your delicate features.Let your rough feathers be
torn in place of your sorrowing hair; instead of the long trumpet, [354]
let your songs resound.Why, Philomela, are you complaining of the cruelty of _Tereus,_ the
Ismarian tyrant?_Surely,_ that grievance is worn out by its _length of_
years.Turn your attention to the sad end of a bird so prized.It is
is a great cause of sorrow, but, _still,_ that so old.All, who poise
yourselves in your career in the liquid air; but you, above the rest,
affectionate turtle-dove, [360] lament him.Throughout life there was a
firm attachment between you, and your prolonged and lasting friendship
endured to the end.What the Phocian youth [361] was to the Argive
Orestes, the same, parrot, was the turtle-dove to you, so long as it was
allowed _by fate._

But what _matters_ that friendship?What the beauty of your rare
plumage?What your voice so ingenious at imitating sounds?What
avails it that _ever_ since you were given, you pleased my mistress?Unfortunate pride of _all_ birds, you are indeed laid low.With your
feathers you could outvie the green emerald, having your purple beak
tinted with the ruddy saffron.There was no bird on earth more skilled
at imitating sounds; so prettily [362] did you utter words with your
lisping notes.Through envy, you were snatched away _from us_: you were the cause of
no cruel wars; you were a chatterer, and the lover of peaceful concord.See, the quails, amid _all_ their battles, [363] live on; perhaps, too,
for that reason, they become old.With a very little you were satisfied;
and, through your love of talking, you could not give time to your mouth
for much food.A nut was your food, and poppies the cause of sleep; and
a drop of pure water used to dispel your thirst.The gluttonous vulture
lives on, the kite, too, that forms its circles in the air, and the
jackdaw, the foreboder [364] of the shower of rain.The crow, too, lives
on, hateful to the armed Minerva; [366] it, indeed, will hardly die
after nine ages.[367] The prattling parrot is dead, the mimic of the
human voice, sent as a gift from the ends of the earth.What is best,
is generally first carried off by greedy hands; what is worthless, fills
its _destined_ numbers.[368] Thersites was the witness of the lamented
death of him from Phylax; and now Hector became ashes, while his
brothers _yet_ lived.Why should I mention the affectionate prayers of my anxious mistress in
your behalf; prayers borne over the seas by the stormy North wind?The
seventh day was come, [369] that was doomed to give no morrow; and now
stood your Destiny, with her distaff all uncovered.And yet your words
did not die away, in your faltering mouth; as you died, your tongue
cried aloud, "Corinna, farewell!"[370]

At the foot of the Elysian hill [371] a grove, overshaded with dark holm
oaks, and the earth, moist with never-dying grass, is green.If there
is any believing in matters of doubt, that is said to be the abode of
innocent birds, from which obscene ones are expelled.There range far
and wide the guiltless swans; the long-lived Phoenix, too, ever the sole
bird _of its kind.There_ the bird itself of Juno unfolds her feathers;
the gentle dove gives kisses to its loving mate.Received in this home
in the groves, amid these the Parrot attracts the guileless birds by his
words.[372]

A sepulchre covers his bones; a sepulchre small as his body; on which a
little stone has _this_ inscription, well suited to itself: "From this
very tomb [377] I may be judged to have been the favorite of my mistress.I had a tongue more skilled at talking than other birds."_He attempts to convince his mistress, who suspects the contrary, that
he is not in love with her handmaid Cypassis._

|Am I then [378] 'to be for ever made the object of accusation by new
charges?Though I should conquer, _yet_ I am tired of entering the
combat so oft.Do I look up to the _very_ top of the marble theatre,
from the multitude, you choose some woman, from whom to receive a cause
of grief.Or does some beauteous fair look on me with inexpressive
features; you find out that there are secret signs on the features.Do
I praise any one; with your nails you attack her ill-starred locks; if
I blame any one, you think I am hiding some fault.If my colour is
healthy, _then I am pronounced_ to be indifferent towards you; if
unhealthy, _then_ I am said to be dying with love for another.But
I _only_ wish I was conscious to myself of some fault; those endure
punishment with equanimity, who are deserving of it.Now you accuse
me without cause; and by believing every thing at random, you yourself
forbid your anger to be of any consequence.See how the long-eared ass,
[379] in his wretched lot, walks leisurely along, _although_ tyrannized
over with everlasting blows.a fresh charge; Cypassis, so skilled at tiring, [380] is
blamed for having been the supplanter of her mistress.May the Gods
prove more favourable, than that if I should have any inclination for
a faux pas, a low-born mistress of a despised class should attract me!What free man would wish to have amorous intercourse with a bondwoman,
and to embrace a body mangled with the whip?[387] Add, _too_, that she
is skilled in arranging your hair, and is a valuable servant to you for
the skill of her hands.And would I, forsooth, ask _such a thing_ of a
servant, who is so faithful to you?Only that a refusal
might be united to a betrayal?I swear by Venus, and by the bow of the
winged boy, that I am accused of a crime which I never committed._He wonders how Corinna has discovered his intrigue with Cypassis, her
handmaid, and tells the latter how ably he has defended her and himself
to her mistress._

|Cypassis, perfect in arranging the hair in a thousand fashions, but
deserving to adorn the Goddesses alone; discovered, too, by me, in our
delightful intrigue, to be no novice; useful, indeed, to your mistress,
but still more serviceable to myself; who, _I wonder_, was the informant
of our stolen caresses?"Whence was Corinna made acquainted with your
escapade?Is it that, making a slip in any
expression, I have given any guilty sign of our stealthy amours?And
have I _not_, too, declared that if any one can commit the sin with a
bondwoman, that man must want a sound mind?The Thessalian was inflamed by the beauty of the captive daughter of
Brises; the slave priestess of Phoebus was beloved by the general from
Mycenæ.I am not greater than the descendant of Tantalus, nor greater
than Achilles; why should I deem that a disgrace to me, which was
becoming for monarchs?But when she fixed her angry eyes upon you, I saw you blushing all
over your cheeks.But, if, perchance, you remember, with how much more
presence of mind did I myself make oath by the great Godhead of Venus!Do thou, Goddess, do thou order the warm South winds to bear away over
the Carpathian ocean [388] the perjuries of a mind unsullied.In return
for these services, swarthy Cypassis, [389] give me a sweet reward,
your company to-day.Why refuse me, ungrateful one, and why invent new
apprehensions?'Tis enough to have laid one of your superiors under an
obligation.But if, in your folly, you refuse me, as the informer, I
will tell what has taken place before; and I myself will be the betrayer
of my own failing.And I will tell Cypassis, in what spots I have met
you, and how often, and in ways how many and what._To Cupid._

O Cupid, never angered enough against me, O boy, that hast taken up thy
abode in my heart!why dost thou torment me, who, _thy_ soldier, have
never deserted thy standards?And _why_, in my own camp, am I _thus_
wounded?Why does thy torch burn, thy bow pierce, thy friends?'Twere a
greater glory to conquer those who war _with thee_.Nay more, did not
the Hæmonian hero, afterwards, relieve him, when wounded, with his
healing aid, whom he had struck with his spear.[390] The hunter follows
_the prey_ that flies, that which is caught he leaves behind; and he is
ever on the search for still more than he has found.We, a multitude
devoted to thee, are _too well_ acquainted with thy arms; _yet_ thy
tardy hand slackens against the foe that resists.Of what use is it to
be blunting thy barbed darts against bare bones?_for_ Love has left my
bones _quite_ bare.Many a man is there free from Love, many a damsel,
too, free from Love; from these, with great glory, may a triumph be
obtained by thee.Rome, had she not displayed her strength over the boundless earth,
would, even to this day, have been planted thick with cottages of
thatch.[391] The invalid soldier is drafted off to the fields [392]
that he has received; the horse, when free from the race, [393] is sent
into the pastures; the lengthened docks conceal the ship laid up; and
the wand of repose [394] is demanded, the sword laid by.It were
time for me, too, who have served so oft in love for the fair, now
discharged, to be living in quiet._And yet_, if any Divinity were to say to me, 'Live on, resigning love
I should decline it; so sweet an evil are the fair.When I am quite
exhausted, and the passion has faded from my mind, I know not by what
perturbation of my wretched feelings I am bewildered.Just as the horse
that is hard of mouth bears his master headlong, as he vainly pulls in
the reins covered with foam; just as a sudden gale, the land now nearly
made, carries out to sea the vessel, as she is entering harbour; so,
many a time, does the uncertain gale of Cupid bear me away, and rosy
Love resumes his well-known weapons.Pierce me, boy; naked am I exposed
to thee, my arms laid aside; hither let thy strength be _directed_:
here thy right hand tells _with effect_.Here, as though bidden, do thy
arrows now spontaneously come; in comparison to myself, their own quiver
is hardly so well known to them.Wretched is he who endures to rest the whole night, and who calls
slumber a great good.Fool, what is slumber but the image of cold death?The Fates will give abundance of time for taking rest.Only let the words of my deceiving mistress beguile me; in hoping,
at least, great joys shall I experience.And sometimes let her use
caresses; sometimes let her find fault; oft may I enjoy _the favour_ of
my mistress; often may I be repulsed.That Mars is one so dubious,
is through thee, his step-son, Cupid; and after thy example does thy
step-father wield his arms.Thou art fickle, and much more wavering
than thy own wings; and thou both dost give and refuse thy joys at thy
uncertain caprice.Still if thou dost listen to me, as I entreat thee,
with thy beauteous mother; hold a sway never to be relinquished in my
heart.May the damsels, a throng too flighty _by far_, be added to thy
realms; then by two peoples wilt thou be revered._He tells Græcinus how he is in love with two mistresses at the same
time._

|Thou wast wont to tell me, Græcinus [395] (I remember well), 'twas
thou, I am sure, that a person cannot be in love with two females at the
same time.Through thee have I been deceived; through thee have I been
caught without my arms.to my shame, I am in love with two at
the same moment.Both of them are charming; both most attentive to their
dress; in skill, 'tis a matter of doubt, whether the one or the other is
superior.That one is more beauteous than this; this one, too, is more
beauteous than that; and this one pleases me the most, and that one the
most.The one passion and the other fluctuate, like the skiff, [397]
impelled by the discordant breezes, and keep me distracted.Why,
Erycina, dost thou everlastingly double my pangs?Was not one damsel
sufficient for my anxiety?Why add leaves to the trees, why stars to the
heavens filled _with them?_ Why additional waters to the vast ocean?But still this is better, than if I were languishing without a flame;
may a life of seriousness be the lot of my foes.May it be the lot of
my foes to sleep in the couch of solitude, and to recline their limbs
outstretched in the midst of the bed.But, for me, may cruel Love _ever_
disturb my sluggish slumbers; and may I be not the solitary burden of
my couch.May my mistress, with no one to hinder it, make me die _with
love_, if one is enough to be able to do so; _but_ if one is not enough,
_then_ two.Limbs that are thin, [401] but not without strength, may
suffice; flesh it is, not sinew that my body is in want of.Delight,
too, will give resources for vigour to my sides; through me has no fair
ever been deceived.Often, robust through the hours of delicious night,
have I proved of stalwart body, even in the mom.Happy the man, who
proves the delights of Love?Oh that the Gods would grant that to be the
cause of my end!Let the soldier arm his breast [402] that faces the opposing darts, and
with his blood let him purchase eternal fame.Let the greedy man seek
wealth; and with forsworn mouth, let the shipwrecked man drink of the
seas which he has wearied with ploughing them.But may it be my lot to
perish in the service of Love: _and_, when I die, may I depart in the
midst of his battles; [403] and may some one say, when weeping at my
funeral rites: "Such was a fitting death for his life."_He endeavours to dissuade Corinna from her voyage to Baiæ._

|The pine, cut on the heights of Pelion, was the first to teach the
voyage full of danger, as the waves of the ocean wondered: which, boldly
amid the meeting rocks, [404] bore away the ram remarkable for his
yellow fleece.would that, overwhelmed, the Argo had drunk of the
fatal waves, so that no one might plough the wide main with the oar.Corinna flies from both the well-known couch, and the Penates of
her home, and prepares to go upon the deceitful paths _of the ocean_.why, for you, must I dread the Zephyrs, and the Eastern
gales, and the cold Boreas, and the warm wind of the South?There no
cities will you admire, _there_ no groves; _ever_ the same is the azure
appearance of the perfidious main.The midst of the ocean has no tiny shells, or tinted pebbles; [405] that
is the recreation [406] of the sandy shore.The shore _alone_, ye fair,
should be pressed with your marble feet.Thus far is it safe; the rest
of _that_ path is full of hazard.And let others tell you of the warfare
of the winds: the waves which Scylla infests, or those which Charybdis
_haunts_: from what rocky range the deadly Ceraunia projects: in what
gulf the Syrtes, or in what Malea [407] lies concealed.Of these let
others tell: but do you believe what each of them relates: no storm
injures the person who credits them.After a length of time _only_ is the land beheld once more, when, the
cable loosened, the curving ship runs out upon the boundless main: where
the anxious sailor dreads the stormy winds, and _sees_ death as near
him, as he sees the waves.What if Triton arouses the agitated waves?How parts the colour, then, from all your face!Then you may invoke the
gracious stars of the fruitful Leda: [409] and may say, 'Happy she, whom
her own _dry_ land receives!'Tis far more safe to lie snug in the couch,
[410] to read amusing books, [411] _and_ to sound with one's fingers the
Thracian lyre.But if the headlong gales bear away my unavailing words, still may
Galatea be propitious to your ship.The loss of such a damsel, both ye
Goddesses, daughters of Nereus, and thou, father of the Nereids, would
be a reproach to you.Go, mindful of me, on your way, _soon_ to return
with favouring breezes: may that, a stronger gale, fill your sails.Then may the mighty Nereus roll the ocean towards this shore: in this
direction may the breezes blow: hither may the tide impel the waves.Do
you yourself entreat, that the Zephyrs may come full upon your canvass:
do you let out the swelling sails with your own hand.I shall be the first, from the shore, to see the well-known ship, and
I shall exclaim, "'Tis she that carries my Divinities: [412] and I will
receive you in my arms, and will ravish, indiscriminately, many a kiss;
the victim, promised for your return, shall fall; the soft sand shall
be heaped, too, in the form of a couch; and some sand-heap shall be as a
table [413] _for us_.There, with wine placed before us, you shall tell
many a story, how your bark was nearly overwhelmed in the midst of the
waves: and how, while you were hastening to me, you dreaded neither the
hours of the dangerous night, nor yet the stormy Southern gales.Though
they be fictions, [414] _yet_ all will I believe as truth; why should
I not myself encourage what is my own wish?May Lucifer, the most
brilliant in the lofty skies, speedily bring me that day, spurring on
his steed."_He rejoices in the possession of his mistress, having triumphed over
every obstacle._

|Come, triumphant laurels, around my temples; I am victorious: lo!in my
bosom Corinna is; she, whom her husband, whom a keeper, whom a door _so_
strong, (so many foes!)were watching, that she might by no stratagem
be taken.This victory is deserving of an especial triumph: in which the
prize, such as it is, is _gained_ without bloodshed.Not lowly walls,
not towns surrounded with diminutive trenches, but a _fair_ damsel has
been taken by my contrivance.When Pergamus fell, conquered in a war of twice five years: [415] out of
so many, how great was the share of renown for the son of Atreus?But
my glory is undivided, and shared in by no soldier: and no other has
the credit of the exploit.Myself the general, myself the troops, I have
attained this end of my desires: I, myself, have been the cavalry, I
the infantry, I, the standard-bearer _too_.Fortune, too, has mingled
no hazard with my feats.Come hither, _then_, thou Triumph, gained by
exertions _entirely_ my own.And the cause [416] of my warfare is no new one; had not the daughter
of Tyndarus been carried off, there would have been peace between Europe
and Asia.A female disgracefully set the wild Lapithæ and the two-formed
race in arms, when the wine circulated.A female again, [417] good
Latinus, forced the Trojans to engage in ruthless warfare, in thy
realms.'Twas the females, [421] when even now the City was but new,
that sent against the Romans their fathers-in-law, and gave them cruel
arms.I have beheld the bulls fighting for a snow-white mate: the
heifer, herself the spectator, afforded fresh courage.Me, too, with
many others, but still without bloodshed, has Cupid ordered to bear the
standard in his service._He entreats the aid of Isis and Lucina in behalf of Corinna, in her
labour._

|While Corinna, in her imprudence, is trying to disengage the burden of
her pregnant womb, exhausted, she lies prostrate in danger of her life.She, in truth, who incurred so great a risk unknown to me, is worthy
of my wrath; but anger falls before apprehension.But yet, by me it was
that she conceived; or so I think.That is often as a fact to me, which
is possible.Isis, thou who dost [422] inhabit Parætonium, [423] and the genial
fields of Canopus, [424] and Memphis, [425] and palm-bearing Pharos,
[426] and where the rapid.Nile, discharged from its vast bed, rushes
through its seven channels into the ocean waves; by thy'sistra' [428]
do I entreat thee; by the faces, _too_, of revered Anubis; [429] and
then may the benignant Osiris [430] ever love thy rites, and may the
sluggish serpent [431] ever wreath around thy altars, and may the horned
Apis [432] walk in the procession as thy attendant; turn hither thy
features, [433] and in one have mercy upon two; for to my mistress wilt
thou be giving life, she to me.Full many a time in thy honour has she
sat on thy appointed days, [434] on which [435] the throng of the Galli
[436] wreathe _themselves_ with thy laurels.[437]

Thou, too, who dost have compassion on the females who are in labour,
whose latent burden distends their bodies slowly moving; come,
propitious Ilithyia, [438] and listen to my prayers.She is worthy for
thee to command to become indebted to thee.I, myself, in white array,
will offer frankincense at thy smoking altars; I, myself, will
offer before thy feet the gifts that I have vowed.I will add _this_
inscription too; "Naso, for the preservation of Corinna, _offers
these_."But if, amid apprehensions so great, I may be allowed to give
you advice, let it suffice for you, Corinna, to have struggled in this
_one_ combat._He reproaches his mistress for having attempted to procure abortion._

|Of what use is it for damsels to live at ease, exempt from war, and
not with their bucklers, [439] to have any inclination to follow the
bloodstained troops; if, without warfare, they endure wounds from
weapons of their own, and arm their imprudent hands for their own
destruction?She who was the first to teach how to destroy the tender
embryo, was deserving to perish by those arms of her own.That the
stomach, forsooth, may be without the reproach of wrinkles, the sand
must [440] be lamentably strewed for this struggle of yours.If the same custom had pleased the matrons of old, through _such_
criminality mankind would have perished; and he would be required, who
should again throw stones [441] on the empty earth, for the second time
the original of our kind.Who would have destroyed the resources
of Priam, if Thetis, the Goddess of the waves, had refused to bear
_Achilles_, her due burden?If Ilia had destroyed [442] the twins in her
swelling womb, the founder of the all-ruling City would have perished.If Venus had laid violent hands on Æneas in her pregnant womb, the earth
would have been destitute of _its_ Cæsars.You, too, beauteous one,
might have died at the moment you might have been born, if your mother
had tried the same experiment which you have done.I, myself, though
destined as I am, to die a more pleasing death by love, should have
beheld no days, had my mother slain me.Why do you deprive the loaded vine of its growing grapes?And why pluck
the sour apples with relentless hand?When ripe, let them fall of their
own accord; _once_ put forth, let them grow.Life is no slight reward
for a little waiting.Why pierce [443] your own entrails, by applying
instruments, and _why_ give dreadful poisons to the _yet_ unborn?People
blame the Colchian damsel, stained with the blood of her sons; and they
grieve for Itys, Slaughtered by his own mother.Each mother was cruel;
but each, for sad reasons, took vengeance on her husband, by shedding
their common blood.Tell me what Tereus, or what Jason excites you to
pierce your body with an anxious hand?This neither the tigers do in their Armenian dens, [444] nor does the
lioness dare to destroy an offspring of her own.But, delicate females
do this, not, however, with impunity; many a time [445] does she die
herself, who kills her _offspring_ in the womb.She dies herself, and,
with her loosened hair, is borne upon the bier; and those whoever only
catch a sight of her, cry "She deserved it."[446] But let these words
vanish in the air of the heavens, and may there be no weight in _these_
presages of mine.Ye forgiving Deities, allow her this once to do wrong
with safety _to herself_; that is enough; let a second transgression
bring _its own_ punishment._He addresses a ring which he has presented to his mistress, and envi
its happy lot._

|O ring, [447] about to encircle the finger of the beauteous fair, in
which there is nothing of value but the affection of the giver; go as a
pleasing gift; _and_ receiving you with joyous feelings, may she at once
place you upon her finger.May you serve her as well as she is constant
to me; and nicely fitting, may you embrace her finger in your easy
circle.Happy ring, by my mistress will you be handled.To my sorrow, I
am now envying my own presents.that I could suddenly be changed into my own present, by the arts of
her of Ææa, or of the Carpathian old man![448] Then could I wish you
to touch the bosom of my mistress, and for her to place her left hand
within her dress.Though light and fitting well, I would escape from
her finger; and loosened by _some_ wondrous contrivance, into her bosom
would I fall.I too, _as well_, that I might be able to seal [449] her
secret tablets, and that the seal, neither sticky nor dry, might not
drag the wax, should first have to touch the lips [450] of the charming
fair.Only I would not seal a note, the cause of grief to myself.Should
I be given, to be put away in her desk, [459] I would refuse to depart,
sticking fast to your fingers with ray contracted circle.To you, my life, I would never be a cause of disgrace, or a burden
which your delicate fingers would refuse to carry.Wear me, when you
are bathing your limbs in the tepid stream; and put up with the
inconvenience of the water getting beneath the stone.But, I doubt, that
_on seeing you_ naked, my passion would be aroused; and that, a ring, I
should enact the part of the lover._But_ why wish for impossibilities?Go, my little gift; let her understand that my constancy is proffered
with you._He enlarges on the beauties of his native place, where he is now
staying; but, notwithstanding the delights of the country, he says that
he cannot feel happy in the absence of his mistress, whom he invites to
visit him._

|Sulmo, [460] the third part of the Pelignian land, [461] _now_ receives
me; a little spot, but salubrious with its flowing streams.Though the
Sun should cleave the earth with his approaching rays, and though the
oppressive Constellation [462] of the Dog of Icarus should shine, the
Pelignian fields are traversed by flowing streams, and the shooting
grass is verdant on the soft ground.The earth is fertile in corn, and
much more fruitful in the grape; the thin soil [463] produces, too, the
olive, that bears its berries.[464] The rivers also trickling amid the
shooting blades, the grassy turfs cover the moistened ground.In one word, I am mistaken; she who excites
my flame is far off; my flame is here.I would not choose, could I be
placed between Pollux and Castor, to be in a portion of the heavens
without yourself.Let them lie with their anxious cares, and let them
be pressed with the heavy weight of the earth, who have measured out
the earth into lengthened tracks.[465] Or else they should have bid
the fair to go as the companions of the youths, if the earth must be
measured out into lengthened tracks.Then, had I, shivering, had to pace
the stormy Alps, [466] the journey would have been pleasant, so that _I
had been_ with my love.With my love, I could venture to rush through
the Libyan quicksands, and to spread my sails to be borne along by the
fitful Southern gales._Then_, I would not dread the monsters which bark
beneath the thigh of the virgin _Scylla_; nor winding Malea, thy bays;
nor where Charybdis, sated with ships swallowed up, disgorges them, and
sucks up again the water which she has discharged.And if the sway of
the winds prevails, and the waves bear away the Deities about to come
to our aid; do you throw your snow-white arms around my shoulders; with
active body will I support the beauteous burden.The youth who visited
Hero, had often swam across the waves; then, too, would he have crossed
them, but the way was dark.But without you, although the fields affording employment with their
vines detain me; although the meadows be overflowed by the streams, and
_though_ the husbandman invite the obedient stream [467] into channels,
and the cool air refresh the foliage of the trees, I should not seem
to be among the healthy Peliguians; I _should_ not _seem to be in_ the
place of my birth--my paternal fields; but in Scythia, and among the
fierce Cilicians, [468] and the Britons _painted_ green, [469] and the
rocks which are red with the gore of Prometheus.The elm loves the vine, [471] the vine forsakes not the elm: why am
I _so_ often torn away from my love?But you used to swear, _both_ by
myself, and by your eyes, my stars, that you would ever be my companion.The winds and the waves carry away, whither they choose, the empty words
of the fair, more worthless than the falling leaves.Still, if there is
any affectionate regard in you for me _thus_ deserted: _now_ commence
to add deeds to your promises: and forthwith do you, as the nags [472]
whirl your little chaise [473] along, shake the reins over their manes
at full speed.But you, rugged hills, subside, wherever she shall come;
and you paths in the winding vales, be smooth._He says that he is the slave of Corinna, and complains of the tyranny
which she exercises over him._

|If there shall be any one who thinks it inglorious to serve a damsel:
in his opinion I shall be convicted of such baseness.Let me be
disgraced; if only she, who possesses Paphos, and Cythera, beaten by
the waves, torments me with less violence.And would that I had been the
prize, too, of some indulgent mistress; since I was destined to be the
prize of some fair.Beauty begets pride; through her charms Corinna is
disdainful.Pride,
forsooth, is caught from the reflection of the mirror: and _there_ she
sees not herself, unless she is first adorned.If your beauty gives you a sway not too great over all things, face born
to fascinate my eyes, still, you ought not, on that account, to despise
me comparatively with yourself.That which is inferior must be united
with what is great.The Nymph Calypso, seized with passion for a mortal,
is believed to have detained the hero against his will.It is believed
that the ocean-daughter of Nereus was united to the king of Plithia,
[474] _and_ that Egeria was to the just Numa: that Venus was to Vulcan:
although, his anvil [475] left, he limped with a distorted foot.This
same kind of verse is unequal; but still the heroic is becomingly united
[476] with the shorter measure.You, too, my life, receive me upon any terms.May it become you to
impose conditions in the midst of your caresses.I will be no disgrace
to you, nor one for you to rejoice at my removal.This affection will
not be one to be disavowed by you.[477] May my cheerful lines be to you
in place of great wealth: even many a fair wishes to gain fame through
me.I know of one who publishes it that she is Corinna.[478] What would
she not be ready to give to be so?But neither do the cool Eurotas, and
the poplar-bearing Padus, far asunder, roll along the same banks; nor
shall any one but yourself be celebrated in my poems.You, alone, shall
afford subject-matter for my genius._He tells Macer that he ought to write on Love._

|While thou art tracing thy poem onwards [479] to the wrath of Achilles,
and art giving their first arms to the heroes, after taking the oaths;
I, Macer, [480] am reposing in the shade of Venus, unused to toil; and
tender Love attacks me, when about to attempt a mighty subject.Many
a time have I said to my mistress, "At length, away with you:" _and_
forthwith she has seated herself in my lap.Many a time have I said, "I
am ashamed _of myself:" when,_ with difficulty, her tears repressed, she
has said, "Ah wretched me!And _then_ she
has thrown her arms around my neck: and has given me a thousand kisses,
which _quite_ overpowered me.I am overcome: and my genius is called
away from the arms it has assumed; and I _forthwith_ sing the exploits
of my home, and my own warfare.Still did I wield the sceptre: and by my care my Tragedy grew apace;
[481] and for this pursuit I was well prepared.Love smiled both at my
tragic pall, and my coloured buskins, and the sceptre wielded so well
by a private hand.From this pursuit, too, did the influence of my
cruel mistress draw me away, and Love triumphed over the Poet with his
buskins.As I am allowed _to do_, either I teach the art of tender love,
(alas!by my own precepts am I myself tormented:) or I write what was
delivered to Ulysses in the words of Penelope, or thy tears, deserted
Phyllis.What, _too_, Paris and Macareus, and the ungrateful Jason, and
the parent of Hip-polytus, and Hippolytus _himself_ read: and what the
wretched Dido says, brandishing the drawn sword, and what the Lesbian
mistress of the Æolian lyre.How swiftly did my friend, Sabinus, return [482] from all quarters of
the world, and bring back letters [483] from different spots!The fair
Penelope recognized the seal of Ulysses: the stepmother read what was
written by her own Hippolytus.Then did the dutiful Æneas write an
answer to the afflicted Elissa; and Phyllis, if she only survives, has
something to read.The sad letter came to Hypsipyle from Jason: the
Lesbian damsel, beloved _by Apollo_, may give the lyre that she has
vowed to Phoebus.[484] Nor, Macer, so far as it is safe for a poet
who sings of wars, is beauteous Love unsung of by thee, in the midst of
warfare.Both Paris is there, and the adultress, the far-famed cause of
guilt: and Laodamia, who attends her husband in death.If well I know
thee; thou singest not of wars with greater pleasure than these; and
from thy own camp thou comest back to mine._He tells a husband who does not care for his wife to watch her a
little more carefully._

|If, fool, thou dost not need the fair to be well watched; still have
her watched for my sake: that I may be pleased with her the more.What
one may have is worthless; what one may not have, gives the more edge to
the desires.If a man falls in love with that which another permits him
_to love_, he is a man without feeling.Let us that love, both hope and
fear in equal degree; and let an occasional repulse make room for our
desires.Why should I _think of_ Fortune, should she never care to deceive me?I
value nothing that does not sometimes cause me pain.The clever Corinna
saw this failing in me; and she cunningly found out the means by which
I might be enthralled.Oh, how many a time, feigning a pain in her head
[485] that was quite well, has she ordered me, as I lingered with tardy
foot, to take my departure!Oh, how many a time has she feigned a fault,
and guilty _herself,_ has made there to be an appearance of innocence,
just as she pleased!When thus she had tormented me and had rekindled
the languid flame, again was she kind and obliging to my wishes.What
caresses, what delightful words did she have ready for me!What kisses,
ye great Gods, and how many, used she to give me!You, too, who have so lately ravished my eyes, often stand in dread of
treachery, often, when entreated, refuse; and let me, lying prostrate
on the threshold before your door-posts, endure the prolonged cold
throughout the frosty night.Thus is my love made lasting, and it grows
up in lengthened experience; this is for my advantage, this forms food
for my affection.A surfeit of love, [486] and facilities too great,
become a cause of weariness to me, just as sweet food cloys the
appetite.If the brazen tower had never enclosed Danaë, [487] Danaë had
never been made a mother by Jove.While Juno is watching Io 'with her
curving horns, she becomes still more pleasing to Jove than she has been
_before_.Whoever desires what he may have, and what is easily obtained, let him
pluck leaves from the trees, and take water from the ample stream.If
any damsel wishes long to hold her sway, let her play with her lover.that I, myself, am tormented through my own advice.Let _constant_
indulgence be the lot of whom it may, it does injury to me: that which
pursues, _from it_ I fly; that which flies, I ever pursue.But do thou,
too sure of the beauteous fair, begin now at nightfall to close thy
house.Begin to enquire who it is that so often stealthily paces thy
threshold?Why, _too_, the dogs bark [488] in the silent night.Whither
the careful handmaid is carrying, or whence bringing back, the tablets?Why so oft she lies in her couch apart?Let this anxiety sometimes gnaw
into thy very marrow; and give some scope and some opportunity for my
stratagems.If one could fall in love with the wife of a fool, that man could rob
the barren sea-shore of its sand.And now I give thee notice; unless
thou begin to watch this fair, she shall begin to cease to be a flame
of mine.I have put up with much, and that for a long time; I have often
hoped that it would come to pass, that I should adroitly deceive thee,
when thou hadst watched her well.Thou art careless, and dost endure
what should be endured by no husband; but an end there shall be of an
amour that is allowed to me.And shall I then, to my sorrow, forsooth,
never be forbidden admission?Will it ever be night for me, with no
one for an avenger?Shall I heave no sighs in my
sleep?What have I to do with one so easy, what with such a pander of
a husband?By thy own faultiness thou dost mar my joys.Why, then, dost
thou not choose some one else, for so great long-suffering to please?If
it pleases thee for me to be thy rival, forbid me _to be so_.----






BOOK THE THIRD._The Poet deliberates whether he shall continue to write Elegies, or
whether he shall turn to Tragedy._

|There stands an ancient grove, and one uncut for many a year; 'tis
worthy of belief that a Deity inhabits that spot.In the midst there is
a holy spring, and a grotto arched with pumice; and on every side
the birds pour forth their sweet complaints.Here, as I was walking,
protected by the shade of the trees, I was considering upon what work my
Muse should commence.Elegy came up, having her perfumed hair wreathed;
and, if I mistake not, one of her feet was longer _than the other_.[501] Her figure was beauteous; her robe of the humblest texture, her
garb that of one in love; the fault of her foot was one cause of her
gracefulness.Ruthless Tragedy, too, came with her mighty stride; on her scowling brow
were her locks; her pall swept the ground.Her left hand held aloft the
royal sceptre; the Lydian buskin [502] was the high sandal for her feet.And first she spoke; "And when will there be an end of thy loving?O
Poet, so slow at thy subject matter!Drunken revels [503] tell of thy
wanton course of life; the cross roads, as they divide in their many
ways, tell of it.Many a time does a person point with his finger at the
Poet as he goes along, and say, 'That, that is the man whom cruel Love
torments.'Thou art talked of as the story of the whole City, and
yet thou dost not perceive it; while, all shame laid aside, thou art
boasting of thy feats.'Twere time to be influenced, touched by a more
mighty inspiration; [505] long enough hast thou delayed; commence a
greater task.By thy subject thou dost cramp thy genius; sing of the
exploits of heroes; then thou wilt say, 'This is the field that is
worthy of my genius.'Thy Muse has sportively indited what the charming
fair may sing; and thy early youth has been passed amidst its own
numbers.Now may I, Roman Tragedy, gain a celebrity by thy means; thy
conceptions will satisfy my requirements."Thus far _did she speak_; and, supported on her tinted buskins, three or
four times she shook her head with its flowing locks.The other one,
if rightly I remember, smiled with eyes askance.Am I mistaken, or was
there a branch of myrtle in her right hand?"Why, haughty Tragedy," said
she, "dost thou attack me with high-sounding words?And canst thou never
be other than severe?Still, thou thyself hast deigned to be excited in
unequal numbers![506] Against me hast thou strived, making use of my
own verse.I should not compare heroic measures with my own; thy palaces
quite overwhelm my humble abodes.I am a trifler; and with myself,
Cupid, my care, is a trifler too; I am no more substantial myself than
is my subject-matter.Without myself, the mother of wanton Love were
coy; of that Goddess do I show myself the patroness [507] and the
confidant.The door which thou with thy rigid buskin canst not unlock,
the same is open to my caressing words.And yet I have deserved more
power than thou, by putting up with many a thing that would not have
been endured by thy haughtiness."Through me Corinna learned how, deceiving her keeper, to shake the
constancy of the fastened door, [508] and to slip away from her couch,
clad in a loose tunic, [509] and in the night to move her feet without
a stumble.Or how often, cut in _the wood_, [510] have I been hanging
up at her obdurate doors, not fearing to be read by the people as they
passed!I remember besides, how, when sent, I have been concealed in the
bosom of the handmaid, until the strict keeper had taken his
departure.Still further--when thou didst send me as a present on her
birthday [511] --but she tore me to pieces, and barbarously threw me in the
water close by.I was the first to cause the prospering germs of thy
genius to shoot; it has, as my gift, that for which she is now asking
thee."They had now ceased; on which I began: "By your own selves, I conjure
you both; let my words, as I tremble, be received by unprejudiced ears.Thou, the one, dost grace me with the sceptre and the lofty buskin;
already, even by thy contact with my lips, have I spoken in mighty
accents.Thou, the other, dost offer a lasting fame to my loves; be
propitious, then, and with the long lines unite the short."Do, Tragedy, grant a little respite to the Poet.Thou art an everlasting
task; the time which she demands is but short."Moved by my entreaties,
she gave me leave; let tender Love be sketched with hurried hand,
while still there is time; from behind [514] a more weighty undertaking
presses on._To his mistress, in whose company he is present at the chariot races in
the Circus Maximus.He describes the race._

|I am not sitting here [515] an admirer of the spirited steeds; [516]
still I pray that he who is your favourite may win.I have come here to
chat with you, and to be seated by you, [517] that the passion which
yea cause may not be unknown to you.You are looking at the race, I _am
looking_ at you; let us each look at what pleases us, and so let us each
feast our eyes.O, happy the driver [518] of the steeds, whoever he
is, that is your favourite; it is then his lot to be the object of your
care; might such be my lot; with ardent zeal to be borne along would I
press over the steeds as they start from the sacred barrier.[519] And
now I would give rein; [520] now with my whip would I lash their backs;
now with my inside wheel would I graze the turning-place.[521] If you
should be seen by me in my course, then I should stop; and the reins,
let go, would fall from my hands.how nearly was Pelops [522] falling by the lance of him of Pisa,
while, Hippodamia, he was gazing on thy face!Still did he prove the
conqueror through the favour of his mistress; [523] let us each prove
victor through the favour of his charmer.Why do you shrink away in
vain?[524] The partition forces us to sit close; the Circus has this
advantage [525] in the arrangement of its space.But do you [526] on the
right hand, whoever you are, be accommodating to the fair; she is
being hurt by the pressure of your side.And you as well, [527] who are
looking on behind us; draw in your legs, if you have _any_ decency, and
don't press her back with your hard knees.But your mantle, hanging too
low, is dragging on the ground; gather it up; or see, I am taking it
up [528] in my hands.A disobliging garment you are, who are thus
concealing ancles so pretty; and the more you gaze upon them, the more
disobliging garment you are.Such were the ancles of the fleet Atalanta,
[529] which Milanion longed to touch with his hands.Such are painted
the ancles of the swift Diana, when, herself _still_ bolder, she pursues
the bold beasts of prey.On not seeing them, I am on fire; what would be
the consequence if they _were seen?_ You are heaping flames upon
flames, water upon the sea.From them I suspect that the rest may prove
charming, which is so well hidden, concealed beneath the thin dress.But, meanwhile, should you like to receive the gentle breeze which
the fan may cause, [530] when waved by my hand?Or is the heat I feel,
rather that of my own passion, and not of the weather, and is the love
of the fair burning my inflamed breast?While I am talking, your white
clothes are sprinkled with the black dust; nasty dust, away from a body
like the snow.But now the procession [531] is approaching; give good omens both
in words and feelings.The time is come to applaud; the procession
approaches, glistening with gold.First in place is Victory borne [532]
with expanded wings; [533] come hither, Goddess, and grant that this
passion of mine may prove victorious."Salute Neptune, [534] you who put too much confidence in the waves; I
have nought to do with the sea; my own dry land engages me.Soldier,
salute thy own Mars; arms I detest [535] Peace delights me, and Love
found in the midst of Peace.Let Phoebus be propitious to the augurs,
Phoebe to the huntsmen; turn, Minerva, towards thyself the hands of the
artisan.[536] Ye husbandmen, arise in honour of Ceres and the youthful
Bacchus; let the boxers [537] render Pollux, the horseman Castor
propitious.Thee, genial Venus, and _the Loves_, the boys so potent
with the bow, do I salute; be propitious, Goddess, to my aspirations.Inspire, too, kindly feelings in my new mistress; let her permit
herself to be loved."She has assented; and with her nod she has given
a favourable sign.What the Goddess has promised, I entreat yourself to
promise.With the leave of Venus I will say it, you shall be the greater
Goddess.By these many witnesses do I swear to you, and by this array
of the Gods, that for all time you have been sighed for by me.But
your legs have no support; you can, if perchance you like, rest the
extremities of your feet in the lattice work.[538]

Now the Prætor, [539] the Circus emptied, has sent from the even
barriers [540] the chariots with their four steeds, the greatest sight
of all.I see who is your favourite; whoever you wish well to, he will
prove the conqueror.The very horses appear to understand what it is you
wish for.around the turning-place he goes with a circuit
_far too_ wide.The next is overtaking thee
with his wheel in contact.Thou art
wasting the good wishes of the fair; pull in the reins, I entreat, to
the left, [542] with a strong hand.We have been resting ourselves in a
blockhead; but still, Romans, call him back again, [543] and by waving
the garments, [544] give the signal on every side.they are calling
him back; but that the waving of the garments may not disarrange your
hair, [545] you may hide yourself quite down in my bosom.And now, the barrier [546] unbarred once more, the side posts are open
wide; with the horses at full speed the variegated throng [547] bursts
forth.This time, at all events, [548] do prove victorious, and bound
over the wide expanse; let my wishes, let those of my mistress, meet
with success.The wishes of my mistress are fulfilled; my wishes still
exist.He bears away the palm; [549] the palm is yet to be sought by me.She smiles, and she gives me a promise of something with her expressive
eye.That is enough for this spot; grant the rest in another place._He complains of his mistress, whom he has found to be forsworn._

|Go to, believe that the Gods exist; she who had sworn has broken her
faith, and still her beauty remains [550] just as it was before.Not yet
forsworn, flowing locks had she; after she has deceived the Gods, she
has them just as long.Before, she was pale, having her fair complexion
suffused with the blush of the rose; the blush is still beauteous on
her complexion of snow.Her foot was small; still most diminutive is the
size of that foot.Tall was she, and graceful; tall and graceful does
she still remain.Expressive eyes had she, which shone like stars; many
a time through them has the treacherous fair proved false to me.[551]

Even the Gods, forsooth, for ever permit the fair to be forsworn, and
beauty has its divine sway.[552] I remember that of late she swore both
by her own eyes and by mine, and mine felt pain.[553] Tell me, ye
Gods, if with impunity she has proved false to you, why have I suffered,
punishment for the deserts of another?But the virgin daughter of
Cepheus is no reproach, _forsooth_, to you, [554] who was commanded to
die for her mother, so inopportunely beauteous.'Tis not enough that I
had you for witnesses to no purpose; unpunished, she laughs at even the
Gods together with myself; that by my punishment she may atone for her
perjuries, am I, the deceived, to be the victim of the deceiver?Either
a Divinity is a name without reality, and he is revered in vain, and
influences people with a silly credulity; or else, _if there is any_
God, he is fond of the charming fair, and gives them alone too much
licence to be able to do any thing.Against us Mavors is girded with the fatal sword; against us the lance
is directed by the invincible hand of Pallas; against us the flexible
bow of Apollo is bent; against us the lofty right hand of Jove wields
the lightnings.The offended Gods of heaven fear to hurt the fair; and
they spontaneously dread those who dread them not.And who, then, would
take care to place the frankincense in his devotion upon the altars?At
least, there ought to be more spirit in men.Jupiter, with his fires,
hurls at the groves [555] and the towers, and yet he forbids his
weapons, thus darted, to strike the perjured female.Many a one has
deserved to be struck.The unfortunate Semele [556] perished by
the flames; that punishment was found for her by her own compliant
disposition.But if she had betaken herself off, on the approach of her
lover, his father would not have had for Bacchus the duties of a mother
to perform.Why do I complain, and why blame all the heavens?The Gods have eyes as
well as we; the Gods have hearts as well.Were I a Divinity myself,
I would allow a woman with impunity to swear falsely by my Godhead.I
myself would swear that the fair ever swear the truth; and I would not
be pronounced one of the morose Divinities.Still, do you, fair one,
use their favour with more moderation, or, at least, do have some regard
[557] for my eyes._He tells a jealous husband, who watches his wife, that the greater his
precautions, the greater are the temptations to sin._

|Cruel husband, by setting a guard over the charming fair, thou
dost avail nothing; by her own feelings must each be kept.If, all
apprehensions removed, any woman is chaste, she, in fact, is chaste; she
who sins not, because she cannot, _still_ sins.[558] However well you
may have guarded the person, the mind is still unchaste; and, unless it
chooses, it cannot be constrained.You cannot confine the mind, should
you lock up every thing; when all is closed, the unchaste one will be
within.The one who can sin, errs less frequently; the very opportunity
makes the impulse to wantonness to be the less powerful.Be persuaded
by me, and leave off instigating to criminality by constraint; by
indulgence thou mayst restrain it much more effectually.I have sometimes seen the horse, struggling against his reins, rush on
like lightning with his resisting mouth.Soon as ever he felt that rein
was given, he stopped, and the loosened bridle lay upon his flowing
mane.We are ever striving for what is forbidden, and are desiring what
is denied us; even so does the sick man hanker after the water that is
forbidden him.Argus used to carry a hundred eyes in his forehead, a
hundred in his neck; [559] and these Love alone many a time evaded.Danaë, who, a maid, had been placed in the chamber which was to last
for ever with its stone and its iron, [560] became a mother.Penelope,
although she was without a keeper, amid so many youthful suitors,
remained undefiled.Whatever is hoarded up, we long for it the more, and the very pains
invite the thief; few care for what another giants.Not through her beauty is she captivating, but through the fondness
of her husband; people suppose it to be something unusual which has so
captivated thee.Suppose she is not chaste whom her husband is guarding,
but faithless; she is beloved; but this apprehension itself causes
her value, rather than her beauty.Be indignant if thou dost please;
forbidden pleasures delight me: if any woman can only say, "I am
afraid, that woman alone pleases me.Nor yet is it legal [561] to
confine a free-born woman; let these fears harass the bodies of those
from foreign parts.That the keeper, forsooth, may be able to say, 'I
caused it she must be chaste for the credit of thy slave.He is too
much of a churl whom a faithless wife injures, and is not sufficiently
acquainted with the ways of the City; in which Romulus, the son of Ilia,
and Remus, the son of Ilia, both begotten by Mars, were not born without
a crime being committed.Why didst thou choose a beauty for thyself, if
she was not pleasing unless chaste?Those two qualities [562] cannot by
any means be united.'"If thou art wise, show indulgence to thy spouse, and lay aside thy
morose looks; and assert not the rights of a severe husband.Show
courtesy, too, to the friends thy wife shall find thee, and many a
one will she find.'Tis thus that great credit accrues at a very small
outlay of labour.Thus wilt thou be able always to take part in the
festivities of the young men, and to see many a thing at home, [563]
which you have not presented to her._A vision, and its explanation._

|Twas night, and sleep weighed down my wearied eyes.Such a vision as
this terrified my mind.Beneath a sunny hill, a grove was standing, thick set with holm oaks;
and in its branches lurked full many a bird.A level spot there was
beneath, most verdant with the grassy mead, moistened with the drops of
the gently trickling stream.Beneath the foliage of the trees, I was
seeking shelter from the heat; still, under the foliage of the trees it
was hot.seeking for the grass mingled with the variegated flowers,
a white cow was standing before my eyes; more white than the snows at
the moment when they have just fallen, which, time has not yet turned
into flowing water.More white than the milk which is white with its
bubbling foam, [564] and at that moment leaves the ewe when milked.[565] A
bull there was, her companion, he, in his happiness, eas her mate; and
with his own one he pressed the tender grass.While he was lying, and
slowly ruminating upon the grass chewed once again; and once again was
feeding on the food eaten by him before; he seemed, as sleep took away
his strength, to lay his horned head upon the ground that supported
it.Hither came a crow, gliding through the air on light wings; and
chattering, took her seat upon the green sward; and thrice with her
annoying beak did she peck at the breast of the snow-white cow; and with
her bill she took away the white hair.Having remained awhile, she left
the spot and the bull; but black envy was in the breast of the cow.And when she saw the bulls afar browsing upon the pastures (bulls
were browsing afar upon the verdant pastures), thither did she betake
herself, and she mingled among those herds, and sought out a spot of
more fertile grass."Come, tell me, whoever thou art, thou interpreter of the dreams of the
night, what (if it has any truth) this vision means."Thus said I: thus
spoke the interpreter of the dreams of the night, as he weighed in his
mind each particular that was seen; "The heat which thou didst wish to
avoid beneath the rustling leaves, but didst but poorly avoid, was that
of Love.The cow is thy mistress; that complexion is suited to the fair.Thou wast the male, and the bull with the fitting mate.Inasmuch as the
crow pecked at her breast with her sharp beak; an old hag of a procuress
[566] will tempt the affections of thy mistress.In that, after
hesitating long, his heifer left the bull, thou wilt be left to be
chilled in a deserted couch.Envy and the black spots below the front of
her breast, show that she is not free from the reproach of inconstancy."Thus spoke the interpreter; the blood retreated from my chilled face;
and profound night stood before my eyes._He addresses a river which has obstructed his passage while he is going
to his mistress._

|River that hast [567] thy slimy banks planted with reeds, to my
mistress I am hastening; stay thy waters for a moment.No bridges hast
thou, nor yet a hollow boat [568] to carry one over without the stroke
of the oar, by means of the rope thrown across.Thou wast a small
stream, I recollect; and I did not hesitate to pass across thee; and
the surface of thy waves then hardly reached to my ancles.Now, from the
opposite mountain [569] thou dost rush, the snows being melted, and in
thy turbid stream thou dost pour thy muddied waters.What avails it me
thus to have hastened?What to have given so little time to rest?What
to have made the night all one with the day?569*

If still I must be standing here; if, by no contrivance, thy opposite
banks are granted to be trodden by my foot.Now do I long for the wings which the hero, the son of Danaë, [570]
possessed, when he bore away the head, thickset with the dreadful
serpents; now do I wish for the chariot, [571] from which the seed of
Ceres first came, thrown upon the uncultivated ground.Of the wondrous
fictions of the ancient poets do I speak; no time has produced, nor does
produce, nor will produce these wonders.Rather, do thou, stream that
dost overflow thy wide banks, flow within thy limits, then for ever
mayst thou run on.Torrent, thou wilt not, believe me, be able to endure
the reproaches, if perchance I should be mentioned as detained by thee
in my love.Rivers ought rather to aid youths in their loves; rivers themselves have
experienced what love is.Inachus [572] is said to have flowed pale with
love for Melie, [573] the Bithynian Nymph, and to have warmed throughout
his cold fords.Not yet was Troy besieged for twice five years, when,
Xanthus, Neæra attracted thy eyes.Besides; did not enduring love for
the Arcadian maid force Alpheus [574] to run through various lands?They say, too, that thou, Peneus, didst conceal, in the lands of the
Phthiotians, Creüsa, [575] already betrothed to Xanthus.Why should
I mention Asopus, whom Thebe, beloved by Mars, [576] received, Thebe,
destined to be the parent of five daughters?Should I ask of Achelous,
"Where now are thy horns?"thou wouldst complain that they were broken
away by the wrathful hand of Hercules.[577] Not of such value was
Calydon, [578] nor of such value was the whole of Ætolia; still, of
such value was Deianira alone.The enriching Nile, that flows through
his seven mouths, who so well conceals the native spot [579] of waters
so vast, is said not to have been able to overpower by his stream the
flame that was kindled by Evadne, the daughter of Asopus.[580] Enipeus,
dried up, [581] that he might be enabled to embrace the daughter of
Salmoneus, bade his waters to depart; his waters, so ordered, did
depart.Nor do I pass thee by, who as thou dost roll amid the hollow rocks,
foaming, dost water the fields of Argive Tibur [582] whom Ilia [583]
captivated, although she was unsightly in her garb, bearing the marks of
her nails on her locks, the marks of her nails on her cheeks.Bewailing
both the crimes of her uncle, and the fault of Mars, she was wandering
along the solitary spots with naked feet.Her the impetuous stream
beheld from his rapid waves, and raised his hoarse mouth from the midst
of his fords, and thus he said: "Why, in sorrow, art thou pacing my
banks, Ilia, the descendant of Laomedon [584] of Ida?And why does no white fillet
[585] bind thy hair tied up?Why weepest thou, and why spoil thy eyes
wet with tears?And why beat thy open breast with frenzied hand?That
man has both flints and ore of iron in his breast, who, unconcerned,
beholds the tears on thy delicate face.Ilia, lay aside thy fears; my
palace shall be opened unto thee; the streams, too, shall obey thee;
Ilia, lay aside thy fears.Among a hundred Nymphs or more, thou shalt
hold the sway; for a hundred or more does my stream contain.Only,
descendant of Troy, despise me not, I pray; gifts more abundant than my
promises shalt thou receive."_Thus_ he said; she casting on the ground her modest eyes, as she wept,
besprinkled her warm breast with her tears.Thrice did she attempt to
fly; thrice did she stop short at the deep waves, as fear deprived her
of the power of running.Still, at last, as with hostile fingers she
tore her hair, with quivering lips she uttered these bitter words; "Oh!would that my bones had been gathered up, and hidden in the tomb of my
fathers, while yet they could be gathered, belonging to me a virgin!Why
now, am I courted [586] for any nuptials, a Vestal disgraced, and to be
driven from the altars of Ilium?by the fingers
of the multitude am I pointed at as unchaste.Let this disgrace be
ended, which marks my features."Thus far _did she speak_, and before her swollen eyes she extended her
robe; and so, in her despair, did she throw herself [587] into the rapid
waters.The flowing stream is said to have placed his hands beneath her
breast, and to have conferred on her the privilege of his nuptial couch.'Tis worthy of belief, too, that thou hast been inflamed _with love_ for
some maiden; but the groves and woods conceal thy failings.While I have been talking, it has become more swollen with its extending
waves, and the deep channel contains not the rushing waters.What,
furious torrent, hast thou against me?Why, churlish river, interrupt the journey once commenced?What if thou didst flow according to some fixed rule, [588] a river of
some note?What if thy fame was mighty throughout the earth?But no name
hast thou collected from the exhausted rivulets; thou hast no springs,
no certain abode hast thou.In place of spring, thou hast rain and
melted snow; resources which the sluggish winter supplies to thee.Either in muddy guise, in winter time, thou dost speed onward in thy
course; or filled with dust, thou dost pass over the parched ground.What thirsty traveller has been able to drink of thee then?Who has
said, with grateful lips, "Mayst thou flow on for ever?"_Onward_ thou dost run, injurious to the flocks, [589] still more
injurious to the fields.Perhaps these _mischiefs may move_ others; my
own evils move me.did I in my madness relate to
this stream the loves of the rivers?I am ashamed unworthily to have
pronounced names so great.Gazing on I know not what, could I speak of
the rivers [590] Acheloüs and Inachus, and could I, Nile, talk of thy name?But for thy deserts, torrent far from clear, I wish that for thee there
may be scorching heat, and winter always dry.```At non formosa est, at non bene culta puella;

she gives the preference to a wealthy rival._

|And does any one still venerate the liberal arts, or suppose that soft
verses have any merit?Genius once was more precious than gold; but now,
to be possessed of nought is the height of ignorance.After my poems
[591] have proved very pleasing to my mistress, it is not allowed me to
go where it has been allowed my books.When she has much bepraised
me, her door is shut on him who is praised; talented _though I be_, I
disgracefully wander up and down.a Knight gorged with blood, lately enriched, his wealth acquired
[592] through his wounds, [593] is preferred before myself.And can you,
my life, enfold him in your charming arms?Can you, my life, rush into
his embrace?If you know it not, that head used to wear a helmet; that
side which is so at your service, was girded with a sword.That left
hand, which thus late [594] the golden ring so badly suits, used to bear
the shield; touch his right, it has been stained with blood.And can
you touch that right hand, by which some person has met his death?where is that tenderness of heart of yours?Look at his scars, the
traces of his former fights; whatever he possesses, by that body was it
acquired.[595] Perhaps, too, he will tell how often he has stabbed
a man; covetous one, will you touch the hand that confesses this?I,
unstained, the priest of the Muses and of Phoebus, am he who is singing
his bootless song before your obdurate doors.Learn, you who are wise, not what we idlers know, but how to follow the
anxious troops, and the ruthless camp; instead of good verses hold sway
over [596] the first rank; through this, Homer, hadst thou wished it,
she might have proved kind to thee.Jupiter, well aware that nothing is
more potent than gold, was himself the reward of the ravished damsel.[597] So long as the bribe was wanting, the father was obdurate, she
herself prudish, the door-posts bound with brass, the tower made of
iron; but after the knowing seducer resorted to presents, [598] she
herself opened her lap; and, requested to surrender, she did surrender.But when the aged Saturn held the realms of the heavens, the ground kept
all money deep in its recesses.To the shades below had he removed brass
and silver, and, together with gold, the weight of iron; and no ingots
were there _in those times_.But she used to give what was better, corn
without the crooked plough-share, apples too, and honey found in the
hollow oak.And no one used with sturdy plough to cleave the soil;
with no boundaries [599] did the surveyor mark out the ground.The oars
dipped down did not skim the upturned waves; then was the shore [601]
the limit of the paths of men.Human nature, against thyself hast thou
been so clever; and for thy own destruction too ingenious.To what
purpose surround cities with turreted fortifications?[602] To what
purpose turn hostile hands to arms?With the earth thou mightst have been content.Why not seek the heavens
[603] as well, for a third realm?To the heavens, too, dost thou aspire,
so far as thou mayst.Quirinus, Liber, and Alcides, and Caesar but
recently, [604] have their temples.Instead of corn, we dig the solid gold from the earth; the soldier
possesses riches acquired by blood.To the poor is the Senate-house
[605] shut; wealth alone confers honours; [606] hence, the judge so
grave; hence the knight so proud.Let them possess it all; let the field
of Mars [607] and the Forum [608] obey them; let these administer peace
and cruel warfare.Only, in their greediness, let them not tear away my
mistress; and 'tis enough, so they but allow something to belong to the
poor.But now-a-days, he that is able to give away plenty, rules it _over a
woman_ like a slave, even should she equal the prudish Sabine dames.The
keeper is in my way; with regard to me, [609] she dreads her husband.If
I were to make presents, both of them would entirely disappear from
the house.if any God is the avenger of the neglected lover, may he
change riches, so ill-gotten, into dust._He laments the death of the Poet Tibullus._

|If his mother has lamented Memnon, his mother Achilles, and if sad
deaths influence the great Goddesses; plaintive Elegy, unbind thy
sorrowing tresses; alas!too nearly will thy name be derived from fact!The Poet of thy own inspiration, [610] Tibullus, thy glory, is burning,
a lifeless body, on the erected pile.the son of Venus bears
both his quiver inverted, and his bow broken, and his torch without a
flame; behold how wretched with drooping wings he goes: and how he beats
his naked breast with cruel hand.His locks dishevelled about his neck
receive his tears, and his mouth resounds with sobs that convulse his
body.'Twas thus, beauteous Iulus, they say that thou didst go forth
from thy abode, at the funeral of his brother Æneas.Not less was Venus
afflicted when Tibullus died, than when the cruel boar [612] tore the
groin of the youth.And yet we Poets are called 'hallowed,' and the care of the Deities;
there are some, too, who believe that we possess inspiration.[613]
Inexorable Death, forsooth, profanes all that is hallowed; upon all she
lays her [614] dusky hands.What availed his father, what, his mother,
for Ismarian Orpheus [615] What, with his songs to have lulled the
astounded wild beasts?The same father is said, in the lofty woods, to
have sung 'Linus!Add
the son of Mæon, [617] too, by whom, as though an everlasting stream,
the mouths of the poets are refreshed by the waters of Piëria: him, too,
has his last day overwhelmed in black Avernus; his verse alone escapes
the all-consuming pile.The fame of the Trojan toils, the work of
the Poets is lasting, and the slow web woven [618] again through the
stratagem of the night.So shall Nemesis, so Delia, [619] have a lasting
name; the one, his recent choice, the other his first love.[620] Of what use are now the'sistra'
of Egypt?What, lying apart [621] in a forsaken bed?When the cruel
Destinies snatch away the good, (pardon the confession) I am tempted to
think that there are no Deities.Live piously; pious _though you be_,
you shall die; attend the sacred worship; _still_ ruthless Death shall
drag the worshipper from the temples to the yawning tomb.[622] Put your
trust in the excellence of your verse; see!Tibullus lies prostrate; of
so much, there hardly remains _enough_ for a little urn to receive.And, hallowed Poet, have the flames of the pile consumed thee, and have
they not been afraid to feed upon that heart of thine?They could have
burned the golden temples of the holy Gods, that have dared a crime so
great.She turned away her face, who holds the towers of Eryx; [623]
there are some, too, who affirm that she did not withhold her tears.But
still, this is better than if the Phæacian land [624] had buried him a
stranger, in an ignoble spot.Here, [625] at least, a mother pressed his
tearful eyes [626] as he fled, and presented the last gifts [627] to his
ashes; here a sister came to share the grief with her wretched mother,
tearing her unadorned locks.And with thy relatives, both Nemesis and
thy first love [628] joined their kisses; and they left not the pile in
solitude.Delia, as she departed, said, "More fortunately was I beloved
by thee; so long as I was thy flame, thou didst live."To her said
Nemesis: "What dost thou say?When
dying, he grasped me with his failing hand."[629]

If, however, aught of us remains, but name and spirit, Tibullus will
exist in the Elysian vales.Go to meet him, learned Catullus, [630]
with thy Calvus, having thy youthful temples bound with ivy.Thou
too, Gallus, (if the accusation of the injury of thy friend is false)
prodigal of thy blood [631] and of thy life.Of these, thy shade is the companion; if only there is any shade of the
body, polished Tibullus; thou hast swelled the blessed throng.Rest,
bones, I pray, in quiet, in the untouched urn; and may the earth prove
not heavy for thy ashes._He complains to Ceres that during her rites he is separated from his
mistress._

|The yearly season of the rites of Ceres [632] is come: my mistress
lies apart on a solitary couch.Yellow Ceres, having thy floating locks
crowned with ears of corn, why dost thou interfere with my pleasures by
thy rites?Thee, Goddess, nations speak of as bounteous everywhere: and
no one is less unfavorable to the blessings of mankind.In former times the uncouth peasants did not parch the corn; and the
threshing floor was a name unknown on earth.But the oaks, the early
oracles, [633] used to bear acorns; these, and the grass of the shooting
sod, were the food of men.Ceres was the first to teach the seed to
swell in the fields, and with the sickle did she cut her coloured locks;
she first forced the bulls to place their necks beneath the yoke; and
she with crooked tooth turned up the fallow ground.Can any one believe
that she takes delight in the tears of lovers, and is duly propitiated
with misery and single-blessedness?Nor yet (although she loves the
fruitful fields) is she a coy one; nor lias she a breast devoid of
love.The Cretans shall be my witnesses; and the Cretans do not feign
everything; the Cretans, a nation proud of having nurtured Jove.[634]
There, he who rules the starry citadel of the world, a little child,
drank milk with tender lips.There is full confidence in the witness;
by its foster-child the witness is recommended I think that Ceres will
confess her frailties, so well known.The Goddess had beheld Iasius [635] at the foot of Cretan Ida, as he
pierced the backs of the wild beasts with unerring hand.She beheld, and
when her tender marrow caught the flame; on the one side Shame, on the
other Love, inflamed her.Shame was conquered by Love; you might see the
furrows lying dry, and the crops coming up with a very small proportion
of their wheat.[636] When the mattocks stoutly wielded had turned up
the land, and the crooked plough had broken the hard earth, and the
seed had fallen equally scattered over the wide fields; the hopes of the
deceived husbandman were vain.The Goddess, the guardian of corn, was lingering in the lofty woods;
the wreaths of com had fallen from her flowing locks.Crete alone
was fertile in its fruitful year; all places, whither the Goddess had
betaken herself, were one continued harvest.Ida, the locality itself
for groves, grew white with corn, and the wild boar cropped the ears
in the woods.The law-giving Minos [637] wished for himself many like
years; he wished that the love of Ceres might prove lasting.Whereas, yellow-haired Goddess, single-blessedness would have been sad
to thee; this am I now compelled by thy rites to endure.Why should I
be sad, when thy daughter has been found again by thee, and rules over
realms, only less than Juno in rank?This festive day calls for both
Venus, and songs, and wine.These gifts is it fitting to bear to the
ruling Gods._He tells his mistress that he cannot help loving her._

|Much and long time have I suffered; by your faults is my patience
overcome.Depart from my wearied breast, disgraceful Love.In truth I
have now liberated myself, and I have burst my chains; and I am ashamed
to have borne what it shamed me not to endure.I have conquered; and
Love subdued I have trodden under foot; late have the horns [638] come
upon my head.Have patience, and endure, [639] this pain will one day
avail thee; often has the bitter potion given refreshment to the sick.And could I then endure, repulsed so oft from thy doors, to lay a
free-born body upon the hard ground?[640] And did I then, like a slave,
keep watch before thy street door, for some stranger I know not whom,
that you were holding in your embrace?And did I behold it, when the
wearied paramour came out of your door, carrying off his jaded and
exhausted sides?Still, this is more endurable than the fact that I was
beheld by him; [641] may that disgrace be the lot of my foes.When have I not kept close fastened to your side as you walked, [642]
myself your keeper, myself your husband, myself your companion?And,
celebrated by me forsooth, did you please the public: my passion was
the cause of passion in many.Why mention the base perjuries of your
perfidious tongue?and why the Gods forsworn [643] for my destruction?Why the silent nods of young men at banquets, [644] and words concealed
in signs arranged _beforehand?_ She was reported to me to be ill;
headlong and distracted I ran; I arrived; and, to my rival she was not
ill.[645]

Bearing these things, and others on which I am silent, I have oft
endured them; find another in my stead, who could put up with these
things.Now my ship, crowned with the votive chaplet, listens in safety
to the swelling waves of the ocean.Cease to lavish your blandishments
and the words which once availed; I am not a fool, as once I was.Love
on this side, Hatred on that, are struggling, and are dragging my tender
heart in opposite directions; but Love, I think, still gets the better.I will hate, [646] if I can; if not, reluctantly will I love; the bull
loves not his yoke; still, that which he hates he bears.I fly from treachery; your beauty, as I fly, brings me back; I abhor the
failings of your morals; your person I love.Thus, I can neither live
without you, nor yet with you; and I appear to be unacquainted with
my own wishes.I wish that either you were less handsome, or less
unprincipled.So beauteous a form does not suit morals so bad.Your
actions excite hatred; your beauty demands love.she is
more potent than her frailties.O pardon me, by the common rites of our bed, by all the Gods who so
often allow themselves to be deceived by you, and by your beauty, equal
to a great Divinity with me, and by your eyes, which have captivated
my own; whatever you shall be, ever shall you be mine; only do you make
choice whether you will wish me to wish as well to love you, or whether
I am to love you by compulsion.I would rather spread my sails and use
propitious gales; since, though I should refuse, I shall still be forced
to love._He complains that he has rendered his mistress so celebrated by his
verses, as to have thereby raised for himself many rivals._

|What day was that, on which, ye birds of no white hue, you sent forth
your ominous notes, ever sad to me in my loves?Or what star must I
consider to be the enemy of my destiny?Or what Deities am I to complain
of, as waging war against me?She, who but lately [647] was called my
own, whom I commenced alone to love, I fear that with many she must be
shared by me.'Tis so; by my genius
has she been made public.And justly; for why have I made proclamation
[648] of her charms?Through my fault has the fair been put up for sale.She pleases, and I the procurer; by my guidance is the lover introduced;
by my hands has her door been opened.Whether verses are of any use,
is matter of doubt; at all events, they have injured me; they have
been envious of my happiness.While Thebes, [649] while Troy, while the
exploits of Caesar existed; Corinna alone warmed my genius.Would that I
had meddled with verses against the will of the Muses; and that Phoebus
had deserted the work commenced!And yet, it is not the custom to listen
to Poets as witnesses; [650] I would have preferred all weight to be
wanting to my words.Through us, Scylla, who robbed her father of his white hair, bears the
raging dogs [651] beneath her thigh and loins.We have given wings to
the feet, serpents to the hair; the victorious descendant of Abas [652]
is borne upon the winged steed.We, too, have extended Tityus [653] over
the vast space, and have formed the three mouths for the dog bristling
-with snakes.We have described Enceladus, [654] hurling with his
thousand arms; and the heroes captivated by the voice of the two-shaped
damsels.[655] In the Ithacan bags [656] have we enclosed the winds of
Æolus; the treacherous Tantalus thirsts in the middle of the stream.Of
Niobe we have made the rock, of the damsel, the she-bear; the Cecropian
[657] bird sings of Odrysian Itys.Jupiter transforms himself, either
into a bird, or into gold [658] or, as a bull, with the virgin placed upon
him, he cleaves the waves.Why mention Proteus, and the Theban seed,
[659] the teeth?Why that there were bulls, which vomited flames from
their mouths?Why, charioteer, that thy sisters distil amber tears?[660] Why that they are now Goddesses of the sea, who once were ships?[661] Why that the light of day fled from the hellish banquet [662] of
Atreus?And why that the hard stones followed the lyre [663] as it was
struck?The fertile license of the Poets ranges over an immense space; and
it ties not its words to the accuracy of history.So, too, ought
my mistress to have been deemed to be falsely praised; now is your
credulity a mischief to me._He describes the Festival of Juno, as celebrated at Falisci, the native
place of his wife._

As my wife was born at Falisci, so fruitful in apples, we repaired to
the walls that were conquered, Camillus, by thee.[664] The priestesses
were preparing the chaste festival of Juno, with distinguished games,
and the heifer of the country.'Twas a great remuneration for my stay,
to be acquainted with the ceremony; although a path, difficult from the
ascent, leads the way thither.There stands a grove, ancient, and shaded
with numberless trees; look at it, you must confess that a Divinity
exists in the spot.An altar receives the prayers, and the votive
incense of the pious; an altar made without skill, by ancient hands.When, from this spot, the pipe has given the signal with its usual note,
the yearly procession moves along the covered paths.[665] Snow-white
heifers [666] are led, as the crowd applauds, which the Faliscan grass
has fed on its own plains; calves, too, not yet threatening with the
forehead to inspire fear; and the pig, a smaller victim, from its lowly
sty; the leader too, of the flock, with his horns bending back over his
hardy temples; the goat alone is odious to the Goddess queen.By her
betrayal, discovered in the lofty woods, [667] she is said to have
desisted from the flight she had commenced.Even now, by the boys,
is she aimed at as a mark; [668] and she is given, as a prize, to
the author of her wound.Where the Goddess is to come, the youths and
bashful girls sweep the roads before her, with garments [669] as they
lie.Their virgin hair is adorned with gold and gems; and the proud
mantle conceals their feet, bedecked with gold.After the Grecian manner
[670] of their ancestors, clad in white garments, they bear the sacred
vessels entrusted to them on their heads, placed beneath.The people
hold religious silence, [671] at the moment when the resplendent
procession comes up; and she herself follows after her priestesses.Argive is the appearance of the procession; Agamemnon slain, Halesus
[672] fled from both his crime and his father's wealth.And now, an
exile, having wandered over both land and sea, he erected lofty walls
with prospering hand.He taught his own Falisci the rites of Juno.May they be ever propitious to myself, may they be ever so to her own
people._He entreats his mistress, if she will not be constant, at least, to
conceal her intrigues from him._

|Beauteous since you are, I do not forbid your being frail; but let it
not be a matter of course, that wretched I should know it.Nor does any
severity of mine command you to be quite correct; but it only entreats
you to try to conceal the truth.She is not culpable, whoever can deny
that she has been culpable; and 'tis only the confession of error that
makes a woman disgraced.What madness is it to confess in light of day
what lies concealed in night?And what you do in secret, to say openly
that it is done?The strumpet about to entertain some obscure Roman,
first keeps out the public by fastening up the bar.And will you make
known your frailties to malicious report?And will you make proof of
your own criminality?May your mind be more sound, or, at least, may you
imitate the chaste; and although you are not, let me suppose that you
are chaste.What you do, still do the same; only deny that you do so;
and be not ashamed in public to speak the language of chastity.There is
the occasion which demands wantonness; sate it with every delight; far
thence be all modesty.Soon as you take your departure thence; away at
once with all lasciviousness, and leave your frailties in your chamber=

```Illic nec tunicam tibi sit posuisse rubori,

````Nec femori impositum sustinuisse femur:

```Illic purpureis condatur lingua labellis:

````Inque modos Venerem mille figuret amor;

```Illic nec voces, nec verba juvantia cessent;

````Spondaque lascivâ mobilitate tremat.=

With your garments put on looks that dread accusation; and let modesty
disavow improper pursuits.Deceive the public, deceive me, too; in my
ignorance, let me be mistaken, and allow me to enjoy my silly credulity.Why do I so often espy letters sent and received?Why one side and the
other [673] tumbled, of your couch?Why do I see your hair disarranged
more than happens in sleep, and your neck bearing the marks of teeth?The fading itself alone you do not bring before my eyes; if you hesitate
consulting your own reputation, still, spare me.My senses fail me, and
I am expiring, oft as you confess your failings; and the drops flow,
chilled throughout my limbs.Then do I love you; then, in vain, do I
hate what I am forced to love; 673* then I could wish myself to be dead,
but together with you.No enquiries, for my part, will I make, nor will I try to know what
you shall attempt to conceal; and to me it shall be the same as a false
charge.If, however, you shall be found detected in the midst of your
guilt, and if criminality shall be beheld by my eyes; what has been
plainly seen, do you deny to have been plainly seen; my own eyes shall
give way to your assertions.'Tis an easy conquest for you to vanquish
me, who desire to be vanquished.Let your tongue only be mindful to
say--"I did not do it!"since it is your lot to conquer with two words;
although not by the merit of your cause, still conquer through your
judge._He tells Venus that he now ceases to write Elegies._

|Seek a new Poet, mother of the tender Loves; here the extreme
turning-place is grazed [674] by my Elegies, which I, a foster-child of
the Pelignian fields, have composed; nor have my sportive lays disgraced
me._Me, I say, who_, if that is aught, am the heir to my rank, [675]
even through a long line of ancestors, and not lately made a Knight
in the hurly-burly of warfare.Mantua delights in Virgil, Verona in
Catullus; I shall be called the glory of the Pelignian race; which its
own liberties summon to glorious arms, [676] when trembling Rome dreaded
[677] the allied bands.And some stranger will say, as he looks on the
walls of the watery Sulmo, which occupy but a few acres of land, "Small
as you are, I will call you great, who were able to produce a Poet
so great."Beauteous boy, and thou, Amathusian parent [678] of the
beauteous boy, raise your golden standard from my fields.The horned
[679] Lyæus [680] has struck me with a thyrsus more potent; with mighty
steeds must a more extended plain be paced.Unwarlike Elegies, my
sportive [681] Muse, farewell; a work destined to survive long after I
am dead and gone.----





FOOTNOTES BOOK ONE:


[Footnote 001: Were five books.--Ver.From this it is clear, that
the first edition which Ovid gave to the public of his 'Amores' was
in five Books; but that on revising his work, he preferred (praetulit)
these three books to the former five.It is supposed that he rejected
many of those Elegies which were of too free a nature and were likely to
embroil him with the authorities, by reason of their licentiousness.][Footnote 002: Though it should.--Ver.Burmann has rightly observed,
that 'ut jam,' in this line, has exactly the force of 'quamvis,'
'although.'][Footnote 003: In serious numbers.--Ver.By the 'graves numeri,' he
means Heroic or Hexameter verses.It is supposed that he alludes to the
battle of the Giants or the Titans, on which subject he had begun to
write an heroic poem.In these lines Ovid seems to have had in view the
commencement of the first Ode of Anacreon.][Footnote 004: Suited to the measure.--Ver.The subject being of a
grave character, and, as such, suited to Heroic measure.][Footnote 005: Abstracted one foot.--Ver.He says that every second
line (as is the case in Heroic verse) had as many feet as the first,
namely, six : but that Cupid stole a foot from the Hexameter, and
reduced it to a Pentameter, whereby the Poet was forced to recur to the
Elegiac measure.][Footnote 008: Diminish my energies.--Ver.[Footnote 009: His quiver loosened.--Ver.The 'pharetra,' or
quiver, filled with arrows, was used by most of the nations that
excelled in archery, among whom were the Scythians, Persians, Lycians,
Thracians, and Cretans.It was made of leather, and was sometimes
adorned with gold or painting.It had a lid, and was suspended by a belt
from the right shoulder.Its usual position was on the left hip, and it
was thus worn by the Scythians and Egyptians.The Cretans, however,
wore it behind the back, and Diana, in her statues, is represented as so
doing.This must have been the method in which Cupid is intended in the
present instance to wear it, as he has to unloose the quiver before he
takes out the arrow.Some Commentators, however, would have'solutâ' to
refer simply to the act of opening the quiver.][Footnote 010: In six feet.--Ver.He says that he must henceforth
write in Hexameters and Pentameters, or, in other words, in the Elegiac
measure.][Footnote 011: My Muse.--Ver.The Muse addressed by him would be
Erato, under whose protection were those Poets whose theme was Love.He
bids her wreathe her hair with myrtle, because it was sacred to Venus;
while, on the other hand, laurels would be better adapted to the Heroic
Muse.The myrtle is said to love the moisture and coolness of the
sea-shore.][Footnote 014: Thy step-father.--Ver.He calls Mars the step-father
of Cupid, in consequence of his intrigue with Venus.][Footnote 015: Birds so yoked.--Ver.These are the doves which were
sacred to Venus and Cupid.By yoking them to the chariot of Mars, the
Poe* wishes to show the skill and power of Cupid.][Footnote 016: Io triumphe.--Ver.'Clamare triumphum,' means 'to
shout Io triumphe,' as the procession moves along.Lactantius speaks
of a poem called 'the Triumph of Cupid,' in which Jupiter and the other
Gods were represented as following him in the triumphal procession.][Footnote 017: Thyself with gold.--Ver.The poet Mosehus represents
Cupid as having wings of gold.][Footnote 018: The Gangetic land.--Ver.He alludes to the Indian
triumphs of Bacchus, which extended to the river Ganges.][Footnote 019: Thy kinsman Cæsar--Ver.Because Augustus, as the
adopted son of Julius Cæsar, was said to be descended from Venus,
through the line of Æneas.][Footnote 020: Shield the conquered.--Ver.Although Augustus
had many faults, it must be admitted that he was, like Julius, a most
merciful conqueror, and was generally averse to bloodshed.][Footnote 021: Founder of my family.See the Life of Ovid
prefixed to the Fasti; and the Second Book of the Tristia.][Footnote 022: Each of my parents.--Ver.From this it appears that
this Elegy was composed during the life-time of both of his parents, and
while, probably, he was still dependent on his father.][Footnote 023: No rover in affection.--Ver.'Desuitor,' literally
means 'one who leaps off.'The figure is derived from those equestrians
who rode upon several horses, or guided several chariots, passing from
the one to the other.This sport was very frequently exhibited in
the Roman Circus.Among the Romans, the 'desuitor' generally wore a
'pileus,' or cap of felt.The Numidian, Scythian, and Armenian soldiers,
were said to have been skilled in the same art.][Footnote 024: Of the bird.--Ver.[Footnote 026: The same banquet.--Ver.He says that they are about
to meet at 'coena,' at the house of a common friend.][Footnote 027: The last meal.--Ver.The 'coena' of the Romans is
usually translated by the word'supper'; but as being the chief meal of
the day, and being in general, (at least during the Augustan age) taken
at about three o'clock, it really corresponds to our 'dinner.'][Footnote 028: Warm the bosom of another.--Ver.As each guest while
reclining on the couch at the entertainment, mostly leaned on his left
elbow during the meal, and as two or more persons lay on the same couch,
the head of one person reached to the breast of him who lay above him,
and the lower person was said to lie on the bosom of the other.Among
the Romans, the usual number of persons occupying each couch was three.Sometimes, however, four occupied one couch; while, among the Greeks,
only two reclined upon it.In this instance, he describes the lady as
occupying the place below her husband, and consequently warming his
breast with her head.For a considerable time after the fashion of
reclining at meals had been introduced into Rome, the Roman ladies sat
at meals while the other sex was recumbent.Indeed, it was generally
considered more becoming for females to be seated, especially if it was
a party where many persons were present.Juvenal, however, represents a
bride as reclining at the marriage supper on the bosom of her husband.On the present occasion, it is not very likely that the ladies
were particular about the more rigid rules of etiquette.It must be
remembered that before lying down, the shoes or sandals were taken off.][Footnote 029: Damsel of Atrax.--Ver.He alludes to the marriage
of Hippodamia to Pirithous, and the battle between the Centaurs and the
Lapithæ, described in the Twelfth-.[Footnote 031: Do come first.--Ver.He hardly knows why he asks her
to do so, but still she must come before her husband; perhaps, that
he may have the pleasure of gazing upon her without the chance of
detection; the more especially as she would not recline till her husband
had arrived, and would, till then, probably be seated.][Footnote 032: Touch my foot.--Ver.This would show that she had
safely received his letter.][Footnote 033: My secret signs.--Ver.See the Note in this Volume,
to the 90th line of the 17th Epistle.][Footnote 034: By my eye-brows.--Ver.See the 82nd line of the 17th
Epistle.][Footnote 035: Traced in the wine.--Ver.See the 88th line of the
17th Epistle.][Footnote 036: Your blooming cheeks.--Ver.Probably by way of check
to his want of caution.][Footnote 037: Twisted on your fingers.--Ver.The Sabines were the
first to introduce the practice of wearing rings among the Romans.The
Romans generally wore one ring, at least, and mostly upon the fourth
finger of the left hand.Down to the latest period of the Republic, the
rings were mostly of iron, and answered the'purpose of a signet.The right of wearing a gold ring remained for several centuries the
exclusive privilege of Senators, Magistrates, and Knights.The emperors
were not very scrupulous on whom they conferred the privilege of wearing
the gold ring, and Severus and Aurelian gave the right to all Roman
soldiers.Vain persons who had the privilege, literally covered their
fingers with rings, so much so, that Quintilian thinks it necessary to
warn the orator not to have them above the middle joint of the fingers.The rings and the gems set in them, were often of extreme beauty and
value.From Juvenal and Martial we learn that the coxcombs of the
day had rings for both winter and summer wear.They were kept in
'dactyliothecæ,' or ring boxes, where they were ranged in a row.][Footnote 038: Who are in prayer.--Ver.It was the custom to
hold the altar while the suppliant was praying to the Deities; he here
directs her, while she is mentally uttering imprecations against her
husband, to fancy that the table is the altar, and to take hold of it
accordingly.][Footnote 039: If you are discreet.--Ver.Sapias' is put for'si
sapias,' 'if you are discreet,' 'if you would act sensibly.'][Footnote 041: Ask the servant.--Ver.This would be the slave,
whose office it was to mix the wine and water to the taste of the
guests.He was called [oivôxooç] by the Greeks, 'pincerna' by the
Romans.][Footnote 042: Which you have put down.--Ver.That is, which she
either puts upon the table, or gives back to the servant, when she has
drunk.][Footnote 043: Touched by his mouth.--Ver.This would appear to
refer to some choice morsel picked out of the husband's plate, which, as
a mark of attention, he might present to her.][Footnote 044: On his unsightly breast.--Ver.This, from her
position, if she reclined below her husband, she would be almost obliged
to do.][Footnote 045: So close at hand.--Ver.A breach of these
injunctions would imply either a very lax state of etiquette at the
Reman parties, or, what is more probable, that the present company was
not of a very select character.][Footnote 048: Beneath the cloth.--Ver.'Vestis' means a covering,
or clothing for anything, as for a couch, or for tapestry.Let us
charitably suppose it here to mean the table cloth; as the passage will
not admit of further examination, and has of necessity been somewhat
modified in the translation.][Footnote 049: The conscious covering.--Ver.The 'pallia,' here
mentioned, are clearly the coverlets of the couch which he has before
mentioned in the 41st line; and from this it is evident, that during the
repast the guests were covered with them.][Footnote 050: Add wine by stealth.--Ver.To make him fall asleep
the sooner]

[Footnote 051: 'Twas summer time.--Ver.In all hot climates it is
the custom to repose in the middle of the day.This the Spaniards call
the'siesta.'][Footnote 053: A part of the window.--Ver.On the 'fenestræ,' or
windows of the ancients, see the Notes to the Pontic Epistles, Book iii.5, and to the Metamorphoses, Book xiv.He means that
one leaf of the window was open, and one shut.][Footnote 054: Corinna.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the Tristia,
Elegy x.GO, he says, 'Corinna, (so called by a fictitious name) the
subject of song through the whole city, had imparted a stimulus to my
geuius.'It has been supposed by some Commentators, that under this name
he meant Julia, either the daughter or the grand-daughter of the emperor
Augustus, but there seems really to be no ground for such a belief;
indeed, the daughter of Augustus had passed middle age, when Ovid was
still in boyhood.It is most probable that Corinna was ouly an ideal
personage, existing in the imagination of the Poet; and that he intended
the name to apply to his favourite mistress for the time being, as,
though he occasionally denies it, still, at other times, he admits that
his passion was of the roving kind.There are two females mentioned in
history of the name of Coriuna.One was a Theban poetess, who excelled
in Lyric composition, and was said to have vanquished Pindar himself in
a Lyric contest; while the other was a native of Thespiæ, in Bceotia.'The former, who was famous for both her personal charms and her mental
endowments, is supposed to have suggested the use of the name to Ovid.][Footnote 055: Clothed in a tunic.--Ver.'Tunica' was the name of
the under-garment with both sexes among the Romans.When the wearer was
out of doors, or away from home, it was fastened round the waist with a
belt or girdle, but when at home and wishing to be entirely at ease, it
was, as in the present instance, loose or ungirded.Both sexes usually
wore two tunics.In female dress, Varro seems to call the outer tunic
'subucula,' and the 'interior tunica' by the name also of 'indusium.'The outer tunic was also called'stola,' and, with the 'palla' completed
the female dress.The 'tunica interior,' or what is here called tunica,'
was a simple shift, and in early times had no sleeves.According to
Nonius, it fitted loosely on the body, and was not girded when the
'stola' or outer tunic was put on.Poor people, who could not afford
to purchase a 'toga,' wore the tunic alone; whence we find the lower
classes called by the name of 'tunicati.'][Footnote 056: Her flowing hair.--Ver.'Dividuis,' here means, that
her hair was scattered, flowing over her shoulders and not arranged on
the head in a knot.][Footnote 057: Semiramis.--Ver.Semiramis was the wife of Ninus,
king of Babylon, and was famous for her extreme beauty, and the talent
which she displayed as a ruler.She was also as unscrupulous in her
morals as the fair one whom the Poet is now describing.][Footnote 058: And Lais.--Ver.There are generally supposed to have
beén two famous courtesans of the name of Lais.The first was carried
captive, when a child, from Sicily, in the second year of the 91st
Olympiad, and being taken to Corinth, became famous throughout Greece
for her extreme beauty, and the high price she put upon her favours.Many of the richest and most learned men resorted to her, and became
smitten by her charms.The second Lais was the daughter of Alcibiades,
by his mistress, Timandra.When Demosthenes applied for a share of her
favours, she made the extravagant demand of ten thousand drachmae, upon
which, regaining his wisdom (which had certainly forsaken him for a
time) he said that he would not purchase repentance at so high a price.][Footnote 059: In its thinness.--Ver.Possibly it was made of Coan
cloth, if Corinna was as extravagant as she was vicious.][Footnote 060: The cruel fetter--Ver.Among the Romans, the porter
was frequently bound by a chain to his post, that he might not forsake
it.][Footnote 062: Watches of the keepers.--Ver.Properly, the 'excubiæ'
were the military watches that were kept on guard, either by night or
day, while the term 'vigiliæ,' was only applied to the watch by night.He here alludes to the watch kept by jealous men over their wives.][Footnote 063: Spectres that flit by night.--Ver.The dread of the
ghosts of the departed entered largely among the Roman superstitions.See an account of the Ceremony, in the Fifth Book of the Fasti, 1.422,
et seq., for driving the ghosts, or Lemures, from the house.][Footnote 064: Ready for the whip--Ver.See the Note to the 81st
line of the Epistle of De'ianira to Hercules.Ovid says, that he has
often pleaded for him to his mistress; indeed, the Roman ladies often
showed more cruelty to the slaves, both male and female, than the men
did to the male slaves.][Footnote 065: As you wish.--Ver.Of course it would be the
porter's wish that the night should pass quickly on, as he would be
relieved in the morning, and was probably forbidden to sleep during the
night.][Footnote 066: Hours of the night pass on.--Ver.This is an
intercalary line, being repeated after each seventh one.][Footnote 067: From the door-post.--Ver.The fastenings of the
Roman doors consisted of a bolt placed at the bottom of eacn 'foris,' or
wing of the door, which fell into a socket made in the sill.By way of
additional precaution, at night, the front door was secured by a bar of
wood or iron, here called'sera,' which ran across, and was inserted in
sockets on each side of the doorway.Hence it was necessary to remove or
strike away the bar, 'excutere seram,' before the door could be opened.][Footnote 068: Water of the slave.--Ver.Water was the principal
beverage of the Roman slaves, but they were allowed a small quantity of
wiue, which was increased on the Saturnalia.'Far,' or'spelt,' formed
their general sustenance, of which they received one 'libra' daily.Salt and oil were also allowed them, and sometimes fruit, but seldom
vegetables.Flesh meat seems not to have been given to them.][Footnote 069: About my temples.--Ver.'Circa mea tempora,'
literally, 'around my temples' This-expression is used, because it was
supposed that the vapours of excessive wine affect the brain.He says
that he has only taken a moderate quantity of wine, although the chaplet
falling from off his hair would seem to bespeak the contrary.][Footnote 073: Otherwise I myself!--Ver.Heinsius thinks that this
and the following line are spurious.][Footnote 074: Holding in my torch--Ver.Torches were usually
carried by the Romans, for their guidance after sunset, and were
generally made of wooden staves or twigs, bound by a rope around them,
in a spiral form, or else by circular bands at equal distances.The
inside of the torch was filled with flax, tow, or dead vegetable
matter, impregnated with pitch, wax, rosin, oil, or other inflammable
substances.][Footnote 075: Love and wine.--Ver.He seems, by this, to admit
that he has taken more than a moderate quantity of wine,'modicum
vinum,' as he says above.][Footnote 076: Anxieties of the prison.--Ver.He alludes to the
'ergastulum,' or prison for slaves, that was attached to most of the
Roman farms, whither the refractory slaves were sent from the City to
work in chains.It was mostly under ground, and, was lighted with narrow
windows, too high from the ground to be touched with the hand.Slaves who had displeased their masters were usually sent there for a
punishment, and those of uncouth habits were kept there.Plutarch says
that they were established, on the conquest of Italy, in consequence
of the number of foreign slaves imported for the cultivation of
the conquered territory.They were finally abolished by the Emperor
Hadrian.][Footnote 077: Bird is arousing.--Ver.The cock, whom the poets
universally consider as 'the harbinger of morn.'][Footnote 078: Equally slaves.--Ver.He called the doors, which
were bivalve or folding-doors, his 'conservæ,' or 'fellow' slaves,' from
the fact of their being obedient to the will of a slave.Plautuâ, in
the Asinaria, act.3, has a similar expression:--'Nolo ego
fores, conservas meas a te verberarier.''I won't have my door, my
fellow-slave, thumped by you.'][Footnote 080: Did not Ajax too.--Ver.Ajax Telamon, on being
refused the arms of Achilles, became mad, and slaughtered a flock
of sheep, fancying that they were the sons of Atreus, and his enemy
Ulysses.His shield, formed of seven ox hides, is celebrated by Homer.][Footnote 081: Mystic Goddesses.--Ver.Orestes avenged the death of
his father, Agamemnon, by slaying his own mother, Clytemnestra, together
with her paramour, Ægistheus.He also attempted to attack the Furies,
when they haunted him for the murder of his mother.][Footnote 082: Daughter of Schceneus.--Ver.Atalanta, the Arcadian,
or Mae-nalian, was the daughter of Iasius, and was famous for her skill
in the chase.Atalanta, the Boeotian, was the daughter of Schceneus,
and was renowned for her swiftness, and for the race in which she was
outstripped by Hippomenes.The Poet has here mistaken the one for the
other, calling the Arcadian one the daughter of Schoeneus.The story of
the Arcadian Atalanta is told in the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses,
and that of the daughter of Schceneus, at the end of the Tenth Book of
the same work.][Footnote 083: The Cretan damsel.--Ver.Ariadne, the daughter of
Minos, when deserted on the island of Naxos or Cea.]Cassandra being a priestess, would
wear the sacred fillets, 'vittse.'She was ravished by Ajax Oileus, in
the temple of Minerva.][Footnote 085: The humblest Roman.--Ver.It was not lawful to
strike a freeborn human citizen.'And as they
hound him with thongs, Paul said unto the Centurion that stood by, Is it
lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemncd?'This
privilege does not seem to have extended to Roman women of free birth.][Footnote 086: Strike a Goddess.--Ver.He alludes to the wound
inflicted by Diomedes upon Venus, while protecting her son Æneas.][Footnote 087: Her hurt cheeks--Ver.He implies by this, to his
disgrace which has made her cheeks black and blue by his violence.][Footnote 089: At the middle.--Ver.He says that he ought to have
been satisfied with tearing her tunic down to the waist, where the
girdle should have stopped short the rent; whereas, in all probability,
he had torn it from the top to the bottom.][Footnote 090: Her free-born cheeks.--Ver.It was a common practice
with many of the Romans, to tear and scratch their Slaves on the least
provocation.][Footnote 091: The Parian mountains.--Ver.The marble of Paros
was greatly esteemed for its extreme whiteness.Paros was one of the
Cyclades, situate about eighteen miles from the island of Delos.]'In statione,' was
originally a military phrase, signifying 'on guard'; from which It came
to be applied to any thing in its place or in proper order.][Footnote 094: Does she derive.--Ver.He says that her name,
'Dipsas,' is derived from reality, meaning thereby that she is so called
from the Greek verb [êtxpâui], 'to thirst'; because she was always
thirsty, and never rose sober in the morning.][Footnote 095: The charms of Ææa.--Ver.He alludes to the charms of
Circe and Medea.According to Eustathius, Ææa was a city of Colchis.][Footnote 096: Turns back to its source.--Ver.This the magicians of
ancient times generally professed to do.][Footnote 097: Spinning wheel.--Ver.'Rhombus,' means a
parallelogram with equal sides, but not having right angles, and hence,
from the resemblance, a spinning wheel, or winder.The 'licia' were the
cords or thrums of the old warp, or the threads of the old web to which
the threads of the new warp were joined.Here, however, the word seems
to mean the threads alone.The spinning-wheel was much used in magical
incantations, not only among the Romans, but among the people of
Northern and Western Europe.It is not improbable that the practice was
founded on the so-called threads of destiny, and it was the province of
the wizard, or sorceress, by his or her charms, to lengthen or shorten
those threads, according as their customers might desire.Indeed, in
some parts of Europe, at the present day, charms, in the shape of forms
of words, are said to exist, which have power over the human life at any
distance from the spot where they are uttered; a kind of superstition
which dispenses with the more cumbrous paraphernalia of the
spinning-wheel.Some Commentators think that the use of the 'licia'
implied that the minds of individuals were to be influenced at the will
of the enchanter, in the same way as the old thrums of the warp are
caught up and held fast by the new threads; this view, however, seems
to dispense with the province of the wheel in the incantation.See
the Second Book of the Fasti, 1.The old woman there mentioned
as performing the rites of the Goddess, Tacita, among her other
proceedings, 'binds the enchantea threads on the dark-coloured
spinning-wheel.'][Footnote 098: Venomous exudation.--Ver.This was the substance
called 'hippomanes,' which was said to flow from mares when in a
prurient state.Hesiod says, that 'hippomanes' was a herb which produced
madness in the horses that ate of it.Pliny, in his Eighth Book, says
that it is a poisonous excrescence of the size of a fig, and of a black
colour, which grows on the head of the mare, and which the foal at its
birth is in the habit of biting off, which, if it neglects to do, it is
not allowed by its mother to suck.This fictitious substance was said to
be especially used in philtres.][Footnote 099: Moon was empurpled.--Ver.If such a thing as a fog
ever exists in Italy, he may very possibly have seen the moon of a deep
red colour.][Footnote 101: That she, transformed.--Ver.'Versam,'
'transformed,' seems here to be a preferable reading to 'vivam,'
'alive.'Burmann, however, thinks that the'striges' were the ghosts of
dead sorcerers and wizards, and that the Poet means here, that Dipsas
had the power of transforming herself into a'strix' even while living,
and that consequently 'vivam' is the proper reading.The'strix' was
a fabulous bird of the owl kind, which was said to suck the blood of
children in the cradle.Seethe Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.141, and the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 102: A double pupil, too.--Ver.The pupil, or apple
of the eye, is that part through which light is conveyed to the optic
nerve.Some persons, especially females, were said by the ancients to
have a double pupil, which constituted what was called 'the evil eye.'Pliny the Elder says, in his Seventh Book, that 'all women injure by
their glances, who have a double pupil.'The grammarian, Haephestion,
tells us, in his Fifth Book, that the wife of Candaulcs, king of Lydia,
had a double pupil.Heinsius suggests, that this was possibly the
case with the Ialysian Telchines, mentioned in the Seventh Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.365, 'whose eyes corrupting all things by the very
looking upon them, Jupiter, utterly hating, thrust them beneath the
waves of his brother.'][Footnote 103: And their grandsires.--Ver.One hypercritical
Commentator here makes this remark: 'As though it were any more
difficult to summon forth from the tomb those who have long been dead,
than those who are iust deceased.'He forgot that Ovid had to make up
his line, and that 'antiquis proavos atavosque' made three good feet,
and two-thirds of another.][Footnote 105: The twofold doors.--Ver.The doors used by the
ancients were mostly bivalve, or folding doors.][Footnote 106: Mars in opposition.--Ver.She is dabbling here in
astrology, and the adverse and favourable aspects of the stars.We
are to suppose that she is the agent of the young man who has seen the
damsel, and she is telling her that the rising star of Venus is about to
bring her good luck.][Footnote 107: Makes it his care.--Ver.Burmann thinks that this
line, as it stands at present, is not pure Latin; and, indeed, 'curæ
habet,''makes it his care,' seems a very unusual mode of expression.He suggests another reading--'et, cultæ quod tibi défit, habet,' 'and
he possesses that which is wanting for your being well-dressed,' namely,
money.][Footnote 108: The damsel blushed.--Ver.He says that his mistress
blusned at the remark of the old hag, that the young man was worthy to
be purchased by her, if he had not been the first to make an offer.We
must suppose that here the Poet peeped through a chink of the door, as
he was on the other side, listening to the discourse; or he may have
reasonably guessed that she did so, from the remark made in the same
line by the old woman.][Footnote 109: Your eyes cast down.--Ver.The old woman seems to be
advising her to pretend modesty, by looking down on her lap, so as not
to give away even a look, until she has seen what is deposited there,
and then only to give gracious glances in proportion to her present.It
was the custom for the young simpletons who lavished their money on the
Roman courtesans, to place their presents in the lap or bosom.][Footnote 111: Sabine females.--Ver.The Sabines were noted for
their domestic virtues.The hag hints, that the chastity of the Sabine
women was only the result of their want of good breeding.'Tatio
régnante' seems to point to the good old times, in the same way as our
old songsters have it, 'When good king Arthur reigned.'Tatius
reigned jointly at Rome with Romulus.See the Fourteenth Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 112: In foreign warfare.--Ver.She says, that they are
now in a more civilized state, than when they were fighting just without
the walls of Rome; now they are solely engaged in foreign conquests, and
Venus reigns in the city of the descendants of her son, Æneas.][Footnote 113: Dispel these frowns.--Ver.The damsel has, probably,
frowned here at her last remark, on which she tells her she must
learn to dispense with these frowns, and that when she dispels
them, 'excutit,' so many faults which might otherwise prove to her
disadvantage, will be well got rid of.][Footnote 114: Penelope used to try.--Ver.Penelope, in order that
she might escape the importunity of the suitors, proposed that they
should try to bend the bow of Ulysses, promising her hand to him who
should prove successful.The hag, however, says that, with all her
pretended chastity, Penelope only wanted to find out who was the most
stalwart man among her lovers, in order that she might choose him for a
husbaud.][Footnote 116: Graceful in his mantle.--Ver.The 'palla' was
especially worn by musicians.She is supposed to refer to the statue
of Apollo, which was erected on the Palatine Hill by Augustus; and
her design seems to be, to shew that poetry and riches are not so
incompatible as the girl may, from her lover's poverty, be led to
imagine.][Footnote 117: At a price for his person.--Ver.That is to say,
some rich slave who has bought his own liberty.As many of the Roman
slaves were skilful at various trades and handicrafts, and were probably
allowed the profits of their work after certain hours in the day, it
would be no uncommon thing for a slave, with his earnings, to purchase
his liberty.Some of the slaves practised as physicians, while others
followed the occupation of literary men.][Footnote 118: Rubbed with chalk.--Ver.It was the custom to mark
with chalk, 'gypsum,' the feet of such slaves as were newly imported for
sale.][Footnote 119: Busts about the halls.--Ver.Instead of
'quinquatria,' which is evidently a corrupt reading, 'circum atria' has
been adopted.She is advising the girl not to be led away by notions
of nobility, founded on the number of 'ceræ,' or waxen busts of their
ancestors, that adorned the 'atria,' or halls of her admirers.See the
Fasti, Book i. line 591, and the Note to the passage; also the Epistle
of Laodamia to Protesilaus, line 152.][Footnote 120: Nay, more, should.--Ver.'Quin' seems to be a
preferable reading to-'quid?'][Footnote 121: There will be Isis.--Ver.The Roman women celebrated
the festival of Isis for several successive days, and during that period
they care-fully abstained from the society of men.][Footnote 127: By your censure.--Ver.When she has offended she is
to pretend a counter grievance, so as to outweigh her faults.][Footnote 128: A deaf hearing.--Ver.Literally, 'deaf Godhead.'][Footnote 129: A crafty handmaid.--Ver.The comedies of Plautus and
Terence show the part which the intriguing slaves and handmaids acted on
such occasions.][Footnote 130: A little of many.--Ver.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.'Multos,' as suggested by
Heinsius, is preferable to'multi,' which does not suit the sense.][Footnote 131: Heap from the gleanings--Ver.'Stipula' here means
'gleanings.'She says, that each of the servants must ask for a little,
and those little sums put together will make a decent amount collected
from her lovers.No doubt her meaning is, that the mistress should
pocket the presents thus made to the slaves.][Footnote 132: With a cake.--Ver.The old woman tells how, when
she has exhausted all other excuses for getting a present, to have the
birth-day cake by her, and to pretend that it is her birth-day; in
order that her lover may take the hint, and present her with a gift.The
birth-day cake, according to Servius, was made of flour and honey; and
being set on tabic before the guests, the person whose birth-day it was,
ate the first slice, after which the others partook of it, and wished
him happiness and prosperity.Presents, too, were generally made on
birth-days.][Footnote 133: The Sacred Street."--Ver.The 'via sacra,'
or' Sacred Street, from the old Senate house at Rome towards the
Amphitheatre, and up the Capitoline hill.For the sale of all kinds of
luxuries, it seems to have had the same rank in Rome that Regent Street
holds in London.The procuress tells her, that if her admirer makes no
presents, she must turn the conversation to the 'Via Sacra;' of course,
asking him such questions as, What is to be bought there?What is the
price of such and such a thing?And then she is to say, that she is in
want of this or that, but unfortunately she has no money, &c.][Footnote 134: Conceal your thoughts.--Ver.This expression
resembles the famous one attributed to Machiavelli, that'speech was
made for the concealment of the thoughts.'][Footnote 134: Prove his ruin.--Ver.'Let your lips utter kind
things, but let it be your intention to ruin him outright by your
extravagance.'][Footnote 135: Grant thee both no home--Ver.The 'Lares,' being
the household Gods, 'nullos Lares,' implies 'no home.'][Footnote 136: Everlasting thirst.--Ver.In allusion to her
thirsty name; see the Note to the second line.]It is supposed that this Atticus was
the same person to whom Ovid addresses the Fourth and Seventh Pontic
Epistle in the Second Book.It certainly was not Pomponius Atticus, the
friend of Cicero, who died when the Poet was in his eleventh year.][Footnote 139: The years which."--Ver.The age for serving in the
Roman armies, was from the seventeenth up to the forty-sixth year.][Footnote 140: Of his general.--Ver.He alludes to the four
night-watches of the Roman army, which succeeded each other every three
hours.Each guard, or watch, consisted of four men, of whom one acted as
sentry, while the others were in readiness, in case of alarm.][Footnote 142: The othert doors.--Ver.From the writings of Terence
and Plautus, as well as those of Ovid, we find that the youths of Rome
were not very scrupulous about kicking down the door of an obdurate
mistress.][Footnote 143: Thracian Rhesits.--Ver.See the preceding Epistle of
Pénélope to Ulysses, and the speech of Ulysses in the Thirteenth Book of
the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 144: Cease to love.--Ver.It is hard to say whether the
word 'Desinat' means 'Let him leave off saying so,' or 'Let him cease to
love': perhaps the latter is the preferable mode of rendering it.][Footnote 146: The raving prophetess.--Ver.'Mænas' literally means
'a raving female,' from the Greek word paivopai, 'to be mad.'He alludes
to Cassandra when inspired with the prophetic spirit.][Footnote 147: At the forge.--Ver.When he was detected by means of
the iron net, as related in the Fourth Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 148: A lazy inactivity.--Ver.When persons wished to
be at ease in their leisure moments at home, they were in the habit of
loosening the girdle which fastened the tunic; from this circumstance,
the term 'dis-cinctus' is peculiarly applied to a state of indolence.][Footnote 149: Couch and the shade.--Ver.'Lectus et umbra' means
'lying in bed and reclining in the shade.'The shade of foliage would
have peculiar attractions in the cloudless climate of Italy, especially
for persons naturally inclined to be idle.]'Æra merere' has the same meaning
as'stipendum merere,' 'to earn the pay of a soldier,' whence it came to
signify 'to sene as a soldier.'The ancient accounts differ materially
as to the pay which the Roman soldiers received.][Footnote 151: The Eurotas.--Ver.The Eurotas was the river which
flowed past the walls of Sparta.[Footnote 152: Amymone.--Ver.She was one of the Danaides, and
was carrying water, when she was attacked by a Satyr, and rescued by
Neptune.See the Epistle of Hero to Leander, 1.131, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 153: Fold in his dress.--Ver.The'sinhs' of the 'toga,'
among the men, and of the 'palla,' among the women, which extended in
folds across the breast, was used as a pocket, in which they carried
money, purses, letters, and other articles.When the party was seated,
the'sinus' would almost correspond in meaning with our word 'lap.'][Footnote 154: Avaricious procurer.--Ver.'Leno' was a person who
kept a house for the purposes of prostitution, and who generally robbed
his victims of the profits of their unfortunate calling.This was called
'lenocinium,' and the trade was not forbidden, though the 'lenones' were
considered 'infames,' or 'disgraced,' and thereby lost certain political
rights.]Being probably the slave of the
'leno,' he would use force to make her comply with his commands.][Footnote 156: Hired dishonestly.--Ver.The evidence of witnesses
was taken by the Praetor, and was called 'jusjurandum in judicio,'
whereas the evidence of parties themselves was termed 'jusjurandum in
jure.'It was given on oath by such as the Praetor or other judge chose
to call, or as either party might propose for examination.]The 'area' here means the strong
box, or chest, in which the Romans were accustomed to place their money;
they were generally made of, or bound with, iron or other metal.][Footnote 158: Commissioned judge.--Ver.The 'judices selecti' were
the 'cen-tumviri,' a body of one hundred and five officers, whose duty
it was to assist the Praetor in questions where the right to property
was litigated.In the Second Book of the Tristia, 1.93, we are informed
that the Poet himself filled the office of a 'judex selectus.'][Footnote 159: That is purchased.--Ver.Among the Romans, the
'patroni' defended their 'clientes' gratuitously, and it would have been
deemed disgraceful for them to take a fee or present.][Footnote 160: He who hires.--Ver.The 'conductor' was properly the
person who hired the services, or the property of another, for a fixed
price.The word sometimes means 'a contractor,' or the person with
whom the bargain by the former party is made.See the public contract
mentioned in the Fasti, Book v.[Footnote 161: The Sabine bracelets.--Ver.He alludes to the fate
of the Vestal virgin Tarpeia.261, and Note;
also the Translation of the Metamorphoses, p.[Footnote 163: The son pierced.--Ver.Alcmæon killed his mother
Eriphyle, for having betrayed his father Amphiaraus.See the Second Book
of the Fasti, 1.43, and the Third Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 164: A simple necklace.--Ver.See the Epistle of Deianira
to Hercules, and the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses 1.113, with the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 165: Soil of Alcinoiis.--Ver.The fertile gardens
of Alcinoiis, king of the Phæacians, are celebrated by Homer in the
Odyssey.][Footnote 166: The straggling locks.--Ver.The duty of dressing
the hair of the Roman ladies was divided among several slaves, who were
called by the general terms of 'cosmetæ,' and 'omatrices.'It was the
province of one to curl the hair with a hot iron, called 'calamistrum,'
which was hollow, and was heated in wood ashes by a slave who, from
'cinis,' 'ashes,' was called 'ciniflo.'The duty of the 'psecas' came
next, whose place it was to anoint the hair.Then came that of the
'ornatrix,' who parted the curls with a comb or bodkin; this seems to
have been the province of Napè.][Footnote 167: To be reckoned.--Ver.The Nymphs of the groves were
called [Footnote vanâtai ]; and perhaps from them Nape received her
name, as it is evidently of Greek origin.One of the dogs of Actæon is
called by the same name, in the Metamorphoses, Book iii.[Footnote 168: Giving the signale.--Ver.'Notis' may mean here,
either 'hints,]

'signs,''signals.'In Nizard's French translation it is
rendered'missives.'][Footnote 169: Carry these tablets.--Ver.On the wax tablets,
see the Note to the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.69, and the
Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 170: So well filled.--Ver.'Peraratas' literally means
'ploughed over'; which term is properly applied to the action of the
'stylus,' in ploughing through the wax upon the tablets.Suetonius
relates that Julius Caesar, when he was murdered in the Senate House,
pierced the arm af the assassin Cassius with his'stylus.'][Footnote 172: A long answer.--Ver.She is to write at once, on
having read his letter through.This she could do the more readily, as
she could use the same tablets, smoothing the wax with the broad end of
the 'graphium,' or'stylus.'][Footnote 175: Holding the pen.--Ver.'Graphium' was the Greek name
for the'stylus,' or pen used for writing on the wax tablets.It was
generally of iron or copper, but sometimes of gold.The case in which it
was kept was called 'graphiarium,' or 'graphiaria theca.'][Footnote 176: Of worthless maple.--Ver.He calls the wood of the
tablets 'vile,' in comparison with their great services to him: for,
according to Pliny, Book xvi.15, maple was the most valued wood
for tablets, next to 'citrus,' cedar, or citron wood.It was also more
useful than citron, because it could be cut into leaves, or laminae, of
a larger size than citron would admit of.][Footnote 178: Struck her foot.--Ver.This is mentioned as a bad
omen by Laodamia, in her Epistle to Protesilaüs, 1.So in the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, in the shocking story of Cinyras and Myrrha;
Three times was she recalled by the presage of her foot stumbling.'][Footnote 180: The Corsican lee.--Ver.From Pliny, Book xvi., we
learn that the honey of Corsica was of a bitter taste, in consequence of
the box-trees and yews, with which the isle abounded, and which latter,
according to him, were poisonous.From Diodorus Siculus we learn that
there were many turpentine trees on the island; this would not tend to
improve the flavour of the honey.][Footnote 181: Dyed in vermilion.--Ver.'Minium,''red lead,'
or'vermilion,' was discovered by Callias, an Athenian, according to
Theophrastus.It was sometimes mixed with the wax used for tablets:
probably not the best, but that which was naturally of a bad colour.This censure of the tablets is a good illustration of the grapes being
sour.In the last Elegy, before he has received his repulse, he declares
the wax to be'splen-dida,' 'of brilliaut whiteness through bleaching;'
now, on the other hand, he finds, most ominously, that it is as red as
blood.][Footnote 182: Dreadful crosses.--Ver.See the First Book of the
Pontic Epistlea, Ep.[Footnote 183: The screech-owl.--Ver.'Strix' here means a
screech-owl; and not the fabulous bird referred to under that name, in
the Sixth Book of the Fasti, and the thirteenth line of the Eighth Elegy
of this Book.][Footnote 184: The prosy summons.--Ver.'Vadimonium legere'
probably means, 'to call a man on his bail' or'recognizances.'When the
Praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff required the defendant to
give security for his appearance on the day named.The defendant, on
finding a surety, was said 'vades dare,' or 'vadimonium facere': and the
'vas,' or surety, was said'spondere.'The plaintiff, if satisfied with
the surety, was said 'vadari reum,' 'to let the defendant go on his
sureties.']Some Commentators think that
the word 'cognitor' here means, the attorney, or procurator of the
plaintiff, who might, in his absence, carry on the cause for him.In
that case they would translate 'duro,''shameless,' or 'impudent.'But
another meaning of the word 'cognitor' is 'a judge,' or 'commissioner,'
and such seems to be the meaning here, in which case 'duras' will mean
'severe,' or'sour;' 'as,' according to one Commentator, 'judges are
wont to be.'Much better would they lie amid diaries and day-books, [186]
over which the avaricious huncks might lament his squandered substance.And have I then in reality as well as in name found you full of
duplicity?[187] The very number _of you_ was not one of good omen.What,
in my anger, ought I to pray, but that an old age of rottenness may
consume you, and that your wax may be white with nasty mould?][Footnote 186: And day-books.--Ver.Seneca, at the end of his 19th
Epistle, calls a Calendar by the name of 'Ephemeris,' while a day-book
is meant by the term as used by Ausonius.The word here seems to mean
a 'diary;' while 'tabula' is perhaps a 'day-book,' in which current
expenses are set down, and over which the miser weeps, as the record of
past extravagance.][Footnote 187: Full of duplicity.--Ver.The word 'duplex' means
either 'double,' or 'deceitful,' according to the context.He plays on
this twofold meaning, and says that double though they might be, still
truly deceitful they were; and that the two leaves of the tablets were
of no good omen to him.Two-leaved tablets were technically called
'diptycha.'][Footnote 189: Honour the shades.--Ver.'Parento' means 'to
celebrate the funeral obsequies of one's parents.'Both the Romans and
the Greeks were accustomed to visit the tombs of their relatives
at certain times, and to offer sacrifices, called 'inferiæ,' or
'parentalia.'The souls of the departed were regarded by the Romans as
Gods, and the oblations to them consisted of milk, wine, victims, or
wreaths of flowers.The Poet here refers to the birds which arose from
the funeral pile of Memnon, and wera said to revisit it annually.See
the Thirteenth Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 190: Moisture is cooling.--Ver.'Humor' seems to mean the
dew, or the dampness of the night, which would tend, in a hot climate,
to modify the sultriness of the atmosphere.One Commentator thinks that
the word means the humours of the brain.][Footnote 192: To their masters.--Ver.The schools at Rome were
mostly kept by manumitted slaves; and we learn from the Fasti, Book iii.829, that people were not very particular about paying them.][Footnote 193: The cruel stripes.--Ver.The punishment here
mentioned was generally inflicted on the hands of the Roman school-boys,
with a 'ferula,' or stalk of giant-fennel, as we learn from Juvenal,
Satire 1.]The business of the
'jurisconsultus' was to expound and give opinions on the law, much like
the chamber counsel of the present day.They were also known by the name
of 'juris periti,' or 'consulti' only.Cicero gives this definition of
the duty of a 'consultus.']'He is à person who has such a knowledge of the laws and customs which
prevail in a state, as to be able to advise, and secure a person in
his dealings.They advised their clients gratuitously, either in public
places, or at their own houses.They also drew up wills and contracts,
as in the present instance.][Footnote 195: To become bail.--Ver.This passage has given much
trouble to the Commentators, but it has been well explained by Burmann,
whose ideas on the subject are here adopted.The word'sponsum' has
been generally looked upon here as a noun substantive, whereas it is the
active supine of the verb'spondeo,' 'to become bail' or'security.'The
meaning then is, that some rise early, that they may go and become bail
for a friend, and thereby incur risk and inconvenience, through uttering
a single word,'spondeo,' 'I become security,' which was the formula
used.The obligation was coutracted orally, and for the purpose of
evidencing it, witnesses were necessary; for this reason the
undertaking was given, as in the present instance, in the presence of a
'jurisconsultus.'][Footnote 198: To the pleader.--Ver.'Causidicus' was the person
who pleads the cause of his client in court before the Prætor or other
judges.]Heinsius and other Commentators think
that this line and the next are spurious.The story of Cephalus
and Procris is related at the close of the Seventh Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 201: The Moon gave.--Ver.Ovid says that Diana sent the
sleep upon Endymion, whereas it was Jupiter who did so, as a punishment
for his passion for Juno; he alludes to the youthfulness of the favorite
of Diana, antithetically to the old age of Tithonus, the husband of
Aurora.][Footnote 202: Two nights together.--Ver.When he slept with
Acmena, under the form of her husband Amphion.][Footnote 203: Doctoring your hair.--Ver.Among the ancient Greeks,
black hair was the most frequent, but that of a blonde colour was most
valued.It was not uncommon with them to dye it when turning grey, so as
to make it a black or blonde colour, according to the requirement of the
case.Blonde hair was much esteemed by the Romans, and the ladies were
in the habit of washing their hair with a composition to make it of this
colour.This was called'spuma caustica,' or, 'caustic soap,' wich was
first used by the Gauls and Germans; from its name, it was probably the
substance which had been used inthe present instance.][Footnote 204: So far as ever.--Ver.By this he means as low as her
ancles.][Footnote 205: Afraid to dress.--Ver.He means to say, that it was
so fine that she did not dare to curl it, for fear of injuring it.][Footnote 206: Just like the veils.--Ver.Burmann thinks that
'fila,' 'threads,' is better here than'vela,' and that it is the
correct reading.The swarthy Seres here mentioned, were perhaps the
Chinese, who probably began to import their silks into Rome about this
period.The mode of producing silk does not seem to have been known to
Virgil, who speaks, in the Second Book of the Georgies, of the Seres
combing it off the leaves of trees.Pliny also, in his Sixth Book, gives
the same account.Ovid, however, seems to refer to silkworms under the
name of 'agrestes tineæ,' in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 208: Neither the bodkin.--Ver.This was the
'discerniculum,' a 'bodkin,' which was used in parting the hair.][Footnote 210: Bid the bodkin.--Ver.The 'acus' here mentioned, was
probably the 'discemicirium,' and not the 'crinale,' or hair-pin that
was worn in the hair; as the latter was worn when the hair was bound up
at the back of the head; whereas, judging from the length of the hair
of his mistress, she most probably wore it in ringlets.He says that
he never saw her snatch up the bodkin and stick it in the arm of the
'ornatrix.'][Footnote 211: Iron and the fire.--Ver.He alludes to the
unnecessary application of the curling-iron to hair which naturally
curled so well.][Footnote 212: The very locks instruct.--Ver.Because they
naturally assume as advantageous an appearance as the bodkin could
possibly give them, when arranged with the utmost skill.][Footnote 213: Dione is painted.--Ver.4,
mentions a painting, by Apelles, in which Venus was represented as
rising from the sea.It was placed, by Augustus, in the temple of Julius
Caesar; and the lower part having become decayed, no one could be found
of sufficient ability to repair it.][Footnote 214: Lay down the mirror.--Ver.The mirror was usually
held by the 'ornatrix,' while her mistress arranged her hair.][Footnote 215: Herbs of a rival.--Ver.No person would be more
likely than the 'pellex,' or concubine, to resort to charms and drugs,
for the purpose of destroying the good looks of the married woman whose
husband she wishes to retain.][Footnote 216: All bad omens.--Ver.So superstitious were the
Romans, that the very mention of death, or disease, was deemed ominous
of ill.][Footnote 217: Germany will be sending.--Ver 45.Germany having been
lately conquered by the arms of Augustus, he says that she must wear
false hair, taken from the German captives.It was the custom to cut
short the locks of the captives, and the German women were famed for the
beauty of their hair.][Footnote 218: Sygambrian girl.--Ver.The Sygambri were a people of
Ger many, living on the banks of the rivers Lippe and Weser.][Footnote 219: For that spot.--Ver.She carries a lock of the hair,
which had fallen off, in her bosom.][Footnote 221: My tongue for hire.--Ver.Although the 'patronus
pleaded the cause of the 'cliens,' without reward, still, by the use of
the word 'pros-tituisse,' Ovid implies that the services of the advocate
were often sold at a price.It must be remembered, that Ovid had been
educated for the Roman bar, which he had left in disgust.][Footnote 222: Mæonian bard.--Ver.Strabo says, that Homer was a
native of Smyrna, which was a city of Maeonia, a province of Phrygia.But Plutarch says, that he was called 'Maeonius,' from Maeon, a king of
Lydia, who adopted him as his son.][Footnote 223: Tenedos and Ida.--Ver.Tenedos, Ida, and Simois,
were the scenes of some portions of the Homeric narrative.The first was
near Troy, in sight of it, as Virgil says--'est in conspectu Tenedos.'][Footnote 224: The Ascræan, tool--Ver.Hesiod of Ascræa, in
Boeotia, wrote chieflv upon agricultural subjects.See the Pontic
Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 225: With its juices.--Ver.The'mustum' was the pure
jidcc of the grape before it was boiled down and became'sapa,'
or 'defrutum.'779, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 226: The son of Battus.--Ver.As to the poet Callimachus,
the son of Battus, see the Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 227: To the tragic buskin.--Ver.On the 'cothurnus,' or
'buskin,' see the Tristia, Book ii.Sophocles was one of the most famous of the Athenian Tragedians.He is
supposed to have composed more than one hundred and twenty tragedies, of
which only seven are remaining.]Aratus was a Greek poet, a native of
Cilicia, in Asia Minor.He wrote some astronomical poems, of which one,
called 'Phænomena,' still exists.His style is condemned by Quintilian,
although it is here praised by Ovid.His 'Phænomena' was translated into
Latin by Cicero, Germanicus Caesar, and Sextus Avienus.][Footnote 229: The deceitful slave.--Ver.Although the plays of
Menander have perished, we can judge from Terence and Plautus, how well
he depicted the craftiness of the slave, the severity of the father, the
dishonesty of the procuress, and the wheedling ways of the courtesan.Four of the plays of Terence are translations from Menander.See the
Tristia, Book ii.[Footnote 230: Ennius.--Ver.Quintus Ennius was a Latin poet, a
Calabrian by birth.The
few fragments of his works that remain, show the ruggedness and uncouth
nature of his style.He wrote the Annals of Italy in heroic verse.]See the Second Book of the Tristia, 1.[Footnote 232: Of Varro.--Ver.He refers to Publius Terentius Varro
Attacinus, who wrote on the Argonautic expedition.See the Tristia, Book
ii.439, and the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 233: Lucretius.--Ver.Titus Lucretius Carus is referred
to, whose noble poem on the Epicurean philosophy is still in existence
(translated in Bohn's Classical Library).261 and 426, and the Notes to those passages.][Footnote 234: Tityrus.--Ver.Under this name he alludes to Virgil,
who introduces himself under the name of Tityrus, in his first Eclogue,
See the Pontic Epistles, *Boek iv.[Footnote 235: So long as thou, Rome.--Ver.His prophecy has been
surpassed by the event.Rome is no longer the 'caput urbis,' but the
works of Virgil are still read by all civilized nations.][Footnote 236: Polished Tibullus.--Ver.Albius Tibullus was a Roman
poet of Equestrian rank, famous for the beauty of his compositions.He was born in the same year as Ovid, but died at an early age.Ovid
mentions him in the Tristia, Book ii.In the Third Book of the Amores, El.9,
will be found his Lament on the death of Tibullus.]Cornelius Gallus was a Roman poet of
considerable merit.See the Tristia, Book ii 1.445, and the Note to the
passage, and the Amores, Book iii.[Footnote 238: By the East.--Ver.Gallus was the Roman governor of
Egypt, which was an Eastern province of Rome.][Footnote 239: The golden Tagus.--Ver.Pliny and other authors
make mention of the golden sands of the Tagus, which flowed through the
province of Lusitania, now Portugal.][Footnote 240: The closing fire.--Ver.Pliny says that the ancient
Romans buried the dead; but in consequence of the bones being disturbed
by continual warfare, they adopted the system of burning them.]FOOTNOTES BOOK TWO:


[Footnote 301: The watery Peligni.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, 1.81, and the Fourth Book of the Tristia, 1. x. El.3, he
mentions Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, as the place of his birth.It was
noted for its many streams or rivulets.][Footnote 302: And Gyges.--Ver.This giant was more generally
called Gyas.He and his hundred-handed brothers, Briareus and Cæus, were
the sons of Coelus and Terra.][Footnote 303: Verses bring down.--Ver.He alludes to the power of
magic spells, and attributes their efficacy to their being couched
in poetic measures; from which circumstance they received the name of
'carmina.'][Footnote 304: And by verses.--Ver.He means to say that in the
same manner as magic spells have brought down the moon, arrested the
sun, and turned back rivers towards their source, so have his Elegiac
strains been as wonderfully successful in softening the obduracy of his
mistress.]The name Bagoas, or, as it is here
Latinized.Bagous, is said to have signified, in the Persian language,
'an eunuch.'It was probably of Chaldæan origin, having that meaning.As among the Eastern nations of the present day, the more jealous of the
Romans confided the care of their wives or mistresses to eunuch slaves,
who were purchased at a very large price.][Footnote 306: Daughters of Danaus.--Ver.The portico under the
temple of Apollo, on the Palatine Hill, was adorned with the statues of
Danaus, the son of Belus, and his forty-nine guilty daughters.It was
built by Augustus, on a spot adjoining to his palace.Ovid mentions
these statues in the Third Elegy of the Third Book of the Tristia, 1.[Footnote 307: Let him go.--Ver.'Eat' seems here to mean 'let
him go away' from the house; but Nisard's translation renders it 'qu'il
entre,' 'let him come in.'][Footnote 308: At the sacrifice.--Ver.It is hard to say what'si
faciet tarde' means: it perhaps applies to the rites of Isis, mentioned
in the 25th line.]If she shall be slow in her sacrifice.'][Footnote 309: Linen-clad Isis.--Ver.Seethe 74th line of the
Eighth Elegy of the preceding Book, and the Note to the passage; and the
Pontic Epistles, Book i. line 51, and the Note.The temple of Isis,
at Rome, was in the Campus Martius, or Field of Mars, near the sheep
market.It was noted for the intrigues and assignations of which it was
the scene.][Footnote 310: He turns the house.--Ver.As the Delphin Editor
says, 'Il peut renverser la maison,' 'he can turn the house upside
down.'][Footnote 311: The masters approve..--Ver.He means to say that the
eunuch and his mistress will be able to do just as they please.][Footnote 312: An executioner.--Ver.To blind the husband, by
pretending harshness on the part of Bagous.][Footnote 313: Of the truth.--Ver.38 This line is corrupt, and there
are about ten various readings.The meaning, however, is clear; he is,
by making false charges, to lead the husband away from a suspicion of
the truth; and to put him, as we say, in common parlance, on the wrong
scent.][Footnote 314: Your limited savings.--Ver.'Peculium,' here means
the stock of money which a slave, with the consent of his master, laid
up for his own, 'his savings.'The slaves of the Romans being not only
employed in domestic offices and the labours of the field, but as agents
or factors for their masters, in the management of business, and as
mechanics and artisans in various trades, great profits were made
through them.As they were often entrusted with a large amount of
property, and considerable temptations were presented to their honesty,
it became the practice to allow the slave to consider a part of
his gains, perhaps a per centage, as his own; this was termed his
'peculium.'According to the strict letter of the law, the 'peculium'
was the property of the master, but, by usage, it was looked upon as the
property of the slave.It was sometimes agreed upon between the
master and slave, that the latter should purchase his liberty with
his 'peculium,' when it amounted to a certain sum.If the slave was
manumitted by the owner in his lifetime, his 'peculium' was considered
to be given him, with his liberty, unless it was expressly retained.][Footnote 315: Necks of informers.--Ver.He probably alludes to
informers who have given false evidence.He warns Bagous of their fate,
intending to imply that both his mistress and himself will deny all, if
he should attempt to criminate them.][Footnote 325: Tongue caused this.--Ver.According to one account,
his punishment was inflicted for revealing the secrets of the Gods.][Footnote 326: Appointed by Juno.--Ver.This was Argus, whose fate
is related at the end of the First Book of the Metamorphoses.]He is again addressing Bagous, and
begins in a strain of sympathy, since his last letter has proved of no
avail with the obdurate eunuch.][Footnote 328: Mutilate Joys --Ver.According to most accounts,
Semiramis was the first who put in practice this abominable custom.][Footnote 329: Standard be borne.--Ver.He means, that he is bound,
with his mistress to follow the standard of Cupid, and not of Mars.][Footnote 330: Favours to advantage.--Ver.'Ponere' here means,
literally, 'to put out at interest.'He tells the eunuch that he has
now the opportunity of conferring obligations, which will bring him in à
good interest by way of return.][Footnote 332: Sabine dames.--Ver.Juvenal, in his Tenth Satire, 1.293, mentions the Sabine women as examples of prudence and chastity.][Footnote 333: In her stateliness.--Ver.Burmann would have 'ex
alto' to mean 'ex alto pectore,' 'from the depths of her breast.'In
such case the phrase will correspond with our expression, 'to dissemble
deeply,' 'to be a deep dissembler.'][Footnote 334: Modulates her voice.--Ver.Perhaps 'flectere vocem'
means what we technically call, in the musical art, 'to quaver.'][Footnote 335: Her arms to time.--Ver.Dancing was, in general,
discouraged among the Romans.That here referred to was probably the
pantomimic dance, in which, while all parts of the body were called into
action, the gestures of the arms and hands were especially used, whence
the expressions'manus loquacissimi,' 'digiti clamosi,' 'expressive
hands,' or 'fingers.'During the Republic, and the earlier periods of
the Empire, women never appeared on the stage, but they frequently acted
at the parties of the great.As it was deemed disgraceful for a free man
to dance, the practice at Rome was probably confined to slaves, and the
lowest class of the citizens.536, and the
Note to the passage.][Footnote 336: Hippolytus.--Ver.Hippolytus was an example of
chastity, while Priapus was the very ideal of lustfulness.][Footnote 337: Heroines of old.--Ver.He supposes the women of
the Heroic ages to have been of extremely tall stature.Andromache was
remarkable for her height.][Footnote 338: The brunette.--Ver.'Flava,' when coupled with
a female name, generally signifies 'having the hair of a flaxen,' or
'golden colour'; here, however, it seems to allude to the complexion,
though it would be difficult to say what tint is meant.Perhaps an
American would have no difficulty in translating it 'a yellow girl.'In
the 43rd line, he makes reference to the hair of a 'flaxen,' or 'golden
colour.'][Footnote 339: Tablets rubbed out.--Ver.If 'deletæ' is the correct
reading here, it must mean 'no tablets from which in a hurry you 'have
rubbed off the writing.''Non interceptæ' has been suggested, and it
would certainly better suit the sense.'No intercepted tablets have,
&c.'][Footnote 342: The wine on table.--Ver.The wine was probably on
this occasion placed on the table, after the 'coena,' or dinner.The
Poet, his mistress, and his acquaintance, were, probably, reclining
on their respective couches; he probably, pretended to fall asleep to
watch, their conduct, which may have previously excited his suspicions.][Footnote 343: Moving your eyebrows.--Ver.See the Note to the 19th
line of the Fourth Elegy of the preceding Book.][Footnote 344: Were not silent.--Ver.See the Note to the 20th line
of the same Elegy.][Footnote 345: Traced over with wine.--Ver.See the 22nd and 26th
lines of the same Elegy.]He seems to mean that they
were pretending to be talking on a different subject from that about
which they were really discoursing, but that he understood their hidden
meaning.See a similar instance mentioned in the Epistle of Paris to
Helen, 1.[Footnote 347: Hand of a master.--Ver.He asserts the same right
over her favours, that the master (dominus) does over the services of
the slave.][Footnote 348: New-made husband.--Ter.Perhaps this refers to
the moment of taking off the bridal veil, or 'flammeum,' when she has
entered her husband's house.][Footnote 349: Of her steeds.--Ver.When the moon appeared red,
probably through a fog, it was supposed that she was being subjected to
the spells of witches and enchanters.][Footnote 350: Assyrian ivory.--Ver.As Assyria adjoined India,
the word 'Assyrium' is here used by poetical licence, as really meaning
'Indian.'][Footnote 351: Woman has stained.--Ver.From this we learn that it
was the custom of the Lydians to tint ivory of a pink colour, that it
might not turn yellow with age.][Footnote 352: Of this quality.--Ver.'Nota,' here mentioned, is
literally the mark which was put upon the 'amphorae,' or 'cadi,' the
'casks' of the ancients, to denote the kind, age, or quality of the
wine.Hence the word figuratively means, as in the present instance,
'sort,' or 'quality.'Our word 'brand' has a similar meaning.The finer
kinds of wine were drawn off from the 'dolia,' or large vessels, in
which they were kept into the 'amphoræ,' which were made of earthenware
or glass, and the mouth of the vessel was stopped tight by a plug of
wood or cork, which was made impervious to the atmosphere by being
rubbed over with pitch, clay, or a composition of gypsum.On the
outside, the title of the wine was painted, the date of the vintage
being denoted by the names of the Consuls then in office: and when the
vessels were of glass, small tickets, called 'pittacia,' were suspended
from them, stating to a similar effect.For a full account of
the ancient wines, see Dr.Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities.][Footnote 353: The imitative bird.--Ver.Statius, in his Second
Book, calls the parrot 'Humanæ sollers imitator linguæ,' 'the clever
imitator of the human voice.'][Footnote 354: The long trumpet.--Ver.We learn from Aulus Gellius,
that the trumpeters at funerals were called'siticines.'They headed
the funeral procession, playing mournful strains on the long trumpet,
'tuba,' here mentioned.These were probably in addition to the
'tibicines,' or 'pipers,' whose number was limited to ten by Appius
Claudius, the Censor.See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 360: Affectionate turtle-dove.--Ver.This turtle-dove and
the parrot had been brought up in the same cage together.He probably
refers to these birds in the thirty-eighth line of the Epistle of Sappho
to Phaon where he mentions the turtle-dove as being black.This Elegy is
remarkable for its simplicity and pathetic beauty, and can hardly fail
to remind the reader of Cowper's Elegies, on the death of the bullfinch,
and that of his pet hare.][Footnote 361: The Phocian youth.--Ver.He alludes to the
friendship of Orestes and Pylades the Phocian, the son of Strophius.][Footnote 362: So prettily.--Ver.'Bene' means here, 'prettily,' or
'cleverly,' rather than 'distinctly,' which would be inconsistent with
the signification of blæsus.][Footnote 363: All their battles --Ver.Aristotle, in the Eighth
Chapter of the Ninth Book of his History of Animals, describes quails
or ortolans, and partridges, as being of quarrelsome habits, and much at
war among themselves.][Footnote 364: The foreboder.--Ver.Festus Avienus, in his
Prognostics, mentions the jackdaw as foreboding rain by its chattering.]See the story of the Nymph
Coronis, in the Second Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 367: After nine ages.--Ver.Pliny makes the life of the
crow to last for a period of three hundred years.][Footnote 368: Destined numbers.--Ver.'Numeri' means here, the
similar.parts of one whole: 'the allotted portions of human life.'][Footnote 369: Seventh day was come.--Ver.Hippocrates, in his
Aphorisms, mentions the seventh, fourteenth, and twentieth, as the
critical days in a malady.Ovid may here possibly allude to the seventh
day of fasting, which was supposed to terminate the existence of the
person so doing.][Footnote 370: Corinna, farewell.--Ver.It may have said 'Corinna;'
but Ovid must excuse us if we decline to believe that it said 'vale,'
'farewell,' also; unless, indeed, it had been in the habit of saying so
before; this, perhaps, may have been the case, as it had probably often
heard the Poet say 'vale' to his mistress.][Footnote 371: The Elysian hill.--Ver.He kindly imagines a place
for the souls of the birds that are blessed.][Footnote 372: By his words.--Ver.His calling around him, in
human accents, the other birds in the Elysian fields, is ingeniously and
beautifully imagined.][Footnote 377: This very tomb.--Ver.This and the following line
are considered by Heinsius to be spurious, and, indeed, the next line
hardly looks like the composition of Ovid.][Footnote 378: Am I then.--Ver.'Am
I always then to be made the subject of fresh charges?'][Footnote 379: Long-eared ass.--Ver.Perhaps the only holiday that
the patient ass got throughout the year, was in the month of June,
when the festival of Vesta was celebrated, and to which Goddess he had
rendered an important service.See the Sixth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 380: Skilled at tiring.--Ver.She was the 'ornatrix,'
or 'tiring woman' of Corinna.As slaves very often received their names
from articles of dress, Cypassis was probably so called from the
garment called 'cypassis,' which was worn by women and men of effeminate
character, and extended downwards to the ancles.][Footnote 387: With the whip.--Ver.From this we see that the whip
was applied to the female slaves, as well as the males.][Footnote 388: Carpathian ocean..--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
xi.][Footnote 389: Swarthy Cypassis.--Ver.From this expression, she
was probably a native of Egypt or Syria.][Footnote 390: With his spear.--Ver.He alludes to the cure of
Telephus by the aid of the spear of Achilles, which had previously
wounded him.][Footnote 391: Cottages of thatch.--Ver.In the First Book of the
Fasti, 1.199, he speaks of the time when 'a little cottage received
Quiriuus, the begotten of Mars, and the sedge of the stream afforded him
a scanty couch.'The straw-thatched cottage of Romulus was preserved at
Rome for many centuries.184, and the Note
to the passage.][Footnote 392: Off to the fields.--Ver.The 'emeriti,' or veterans
of the Roman legions, who had served their full time, received a regular
discharge, which was called'missio,' together with a bounty, either in
money, or an allotment of land.Virgil was deprived of his property near
Mantua, by the officers of Augustus; and in his first Eclogue, under
the name of Tityrus, he relates how he obtained restitution of it on
applying to the Emperor.][Footnote 393: Free from the race.--Ver.Literally, 'the starting
place.'][Footnote 394: Wand of repose--Ver.For an account of the 'rudis,'
and the privilege it conferred, see the Tristia, Book, iv, El.[Footnote 395: Græcinus.--Ver.He addresses three of his Pontic
Epistles, namely, the Sixth of the First Book, the Sixth of the Second
Book, and the Ninth of the Fourth Book, to his friend Græcinus.In the
latter Epistle, he congratulates him upon his being Consul elect.][Footnote 396: Without my arms.--Ver.'Inermis,' may be rendered,
'off my guard.'][Footnote 397: Like the skiff.--Ver.'Pliaselos' is perhaps here
used as a general name for a boat or skiff; but the vessel which was
particularly so called, was long and narrow, and probably received its
name from its resemblance to a kidney-bean, which was called 'ptaselus.'The 'phaseli' were chiefly used by the Egyptians, and were of various
sizes, from that of a mere boat to a vessel suited for a long voyage.Appian mentions them as being a medium between ships of war and merchant
vessels.Being built for speed, they were more noted for their swiftness
than for their strength.127, speaks of them as
being made of clay; but, of course, that can only refer to 'pha-seli' of
the smallest kind.][Footnote 401: That are thin.--Ver 23.[Footnote 402: Arm his breast --Ver.He alludes to the 'lorica,' or
cuirass, which was worn by the soldiers.][Footnote 403: Of his battles.--Ver.He probably was thinking at
this moment of the deaths of Cornelius Gallus, and T. Haterius, of the
Equcstriai order, whose singular end is mentioned by Valerius Maximus,
11. ix c.8, and by Pliny the Elder, B.[Footnote 404: The meeting rocks.--Ver 3.See the 121st line of the
Epistle of Medea to Jason, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 405: Tinted pebbles.--Ver.The 'picti lapilli' are
probably camelians, which are found on the sea shore, and are of various
tints.]'Mora,' 'delay,' is put here
for that which causes the delay.'That is a pleasure which belongs to
the shore.'][Footnote 407: In what Malea.--Ver.Propertius and Virgil also
couple Malea, the dangerous promontory on the South of Laconia, with the
Syrtes or quicksands of the Libyan coast.][Footnote 409: Stars of the fruitful Leda.--Ver.Commentators are
divided upon the exact meaning of this line.Some think that it refers
to the Constellations of Castor and Pollux, which were considered to be
favourable to mariners; and which Horace mentions in the first line
of his Third Ode, B. i., 'Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,' 'The
brothers of Helen, those brilliant stars.'Others think that it refers
to the luminous appearances which were seen to settle on the masts
of ships, and were called by the name of Castor and Pollux; they were
thought to be of good omen when both appeared, but unlucky when seen
singly.][Footnote 410: In the couch.--Ver.'Torus' most probably means, in
this place a sofa, on which the ladies would recline while reading.][Footnote 411: Amusing books.--Ver.By using the diminutive
'libellus' here, he probably means some light work, such as a bit of
court scandal, of a love poem.][Footnote 412: My Divinities.--Ver.126,
and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 413: As a table.--Ver.This denotes his impatience to
entertain her once again, and to hear the narrative of her adventures.][Footnote 414: Though they be fictions.--Ver.He gives a sly hit
here at the tales of travellers.][Footnote 415: Twice five years.--Ver.Or the 'lustrum' of the
Romans, see the Fasti, Book iii.166, and the Tristia, Book iv.[Footnote 416: And the cause.--Ver.This passage is evidently
misunderstood in Nisard's translation, 'Je ne serai pas non plus la caus
d'une nouvelle guerre,' 'I will never more be the cause of a new war.'][Footnote 417: A female again.--Ver.He alludes to the war in
Latium, between Æneas and Turnus, for the hand of Lavinia, the daughter
of Latinus and Amata.See the narrative in the Fourteenth book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 421: 'Twas the females--Ver.The rape of the Sabines, by
the contrivance of Romulus, is here alluded to.The narrative will
be found in the Third Book of the Fasti, 1.It has been
suggested, but apparently without any good grounds, that Tarpeia is here
alluded to.][Footnote 422: Thou who dost.--Ver.Io was said to be worshipped
under the name of Isis.][Footnote 423: Parætonium.--Ver.This city was situate at the
Canopic mouth of the Nile, at the Western extremity of Egypt, adjoining
to Libya.According to Strabo, its former name was Ammonia.It
still preserves its ancient name in a great degree, as it is called
al-Baretoun.][Footnote 424: Fields of Canopus.--Ver.Canopus was a city at one
of the mouths of the Nile, now called Aboukir.The epithet
'genialis,' seems to have been well deserved, as it was famous for its
voluptuousness.Strabo tells us that there was a temple there dedicated
to Serapis, to which multitudes resorted by the canal from Alexandria.He says that the canal was filled, night and day, with men and women
dancing and playing music on board the vessels, with the greatest
licentiousness.Sandra travelled to the kitchen.The place was situate on an island of the Nile, and
was about fifteen miles distant from Alexandria.Ovid gives a similar
description of Alexandria, in the Tristia, Book i. El.Memphis was a city situate on the
North of Egypt, on the banks of the Nile.It was said to have been built
by Osirit.]See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 428: By thy sistra.For an account of the mystic
'sistra' of Isis, see the Pontic Epistles, Book i. El.For an account of Anuhis, the Deity
with the dog's head, see the Metamorphoses, Book ix.See the Metamorphoses, Book ix.[Footnote 431: The sluggish serpent.--Ver.Macrobius tells us, that
the Egyptians accompanied the statue of Serapis with that of an animal
with three heads, the middle one that of a lion, the one to the right,
of a dog, and that to the left, of a ravenous wolf; and that a serpent
was represented encircling it in its folds, with its head below the
right hand of the statue of the Deity.To this the Poet possibly
alludes, or else to the asp, which was common in the North of Egypt, and
perhaps, was looked upon as sacred.If so, it is probable that the word
'pigra,''sluggish,' refers to the drowsy effect produced by the sting
of the asp, which was generally mortal.This, indeed, seems the more
likely, from the fact of the asp being clearly referred to, in company
with these Deities, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.93; which
see, with the Note to the passage.][Footnote 432: The horned Apis.--Ver.See the Ninth Book of the
Metamorphoses, 1.Isis is here addressed, as
being supposed to be the same Deity as Diana Lucina, who was invoked by
pregnant and parturient women.Thus Isis appears to Telethusa, a Cretan
woman, in her pregnancy, in the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 434: Thy appointed days.--Ver.Votaries who were
worshipping in the temples of the Deities sat there for a considerable
time, especially when they attended for the purpose of sacrifice.In
the First Book of the Pontic Epistles, Ep.50, Ovid says, 'I have
beheld one who confessed that he had offended the Divinity of Isis,
clothed in linen, sitting before he altars of Isis.']'Queis' seems a preferable reading
to 'qua.'][Footnote 436: The Galli.--Ver.Some suppose that Isis and Cybele
were the same Divinity, and that the Galli, or priests of Cybele,
attended the rites of their Goddess under the name of Isis.It seems
clear, from the present passage, that the priests of Cybele, who were
called Galli, did perform the rites of Isis, but there is abundant proof
that these were considered as distinct Deities.In imitation of the
Corybantes, the original priests of Cybele, they performed her rites
to the sound of pipes and tambourines, and ran to and fro in a frenzied
manner.][Footnote 437: With thy laurels.--Ver.See the Note to the 692nd
line of the Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses.While celebrating the
search for the limbs of Osiris, the priests uttered lamentations,
accompanied with the sound of the'sistra'; but when they had found the
body, they wore wreaths of laurel, and uttered cries, signifying their
joy.][Footnote 438: Ilithyia.--Ver.As to the Goddess Ilithyia, see the
Ninth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 439: With their bucklers.--Ver.Armed with 'peltæ,' or
bucklers, like the Amazons.][Footnote 440: The sand must.--Ver.This figure is derived from the
gladiatorial fights of the amphitheatre, where the spot on which they
fought was strewed with sand, both for the purpose of giving a firm
footing to the gladiators, and of soaking up the blood that was shed.][Footnote 441: Again throw stones.--Ver.He alludes to Deucalion
and Pyr-rha.See the First Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 442: Ilia had destroyed.--Ver.See
her story, related at the beginning of the Third Book of the Fasti.][Footnote 443: Why pierce.--Ver.He alludes to the sharp
instruments which she had used for the purpose of procuring abortion:
a practice which Canace tells Macareus that her nurse had resorted to.See the Metamorphoses, Book
viii.[Footnote 445: Many a time.--Ver.He seems here to speak of this
practice as being frequently resorted to.][Footnote 446: She deserved it.--Ver.From this, it would seem that
the practice was considered censurable; but, perhaps it was one of those
cases whose heinousness is never fully discovered till it has brought
about its own punishment.][Footnote 447: O ring.--Ver.On the rings in use among the ancients,
see the note to the First Book of the Aruores, El.See also
the subject of the seventh Elegy of the First Book of the Tristia.][Footnote 448: Carpathian old man.--Ver.For some account of
Proteus, who is here referred to, see the First Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 449: Be able to seal--Ver.From this, it appears to have
been a signet ring.][Footnote 450: Touch the lips.--Ver.See the Tristia, Book v., El.1 5, and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 459: In her desk.--Ver.'Loculi' used in the plural,
as in the present instance, signified a receptacle with compartments,
similar, perhaps, to our writing desks; a small box, coffer, casket, or
cabinet of wood or ivory, for keeping money or jewels.]See the Note to the first line of the
First Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 461: Pelignian land.--Ver.From Pliny the Elder, we learn
that the Peligni were divided into three tribes, the Corfinienses, the
Superequani, and the Sulmonenses.][Footnote 462: Constellation.--Ver.He alludes to the heat attending
the Dog star, see the Fasti, Book iv., 1.939, and the Note to the
passage.][Footnote 463: The thin soil.--Ver.'Rarus ager' means, a 'thin' or
'loose' soil, which was well suited for the cultivation of the grape.][Footnote 464: That bears its berries.--Ver.In Nisard's
translation, the words 'bacciferam Pallada,' which mean the olive, are
rendered 'L'amande Caere Pallas,' 'the almond dear to Pallas.'][Footnote 465: Lengthened tracks.--Ver.To the Delphin Editor this
seems a silly expression.][Footnote 466: The stormy Alps.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
ii.[Footnote 467: The obedient stream.--Ver.This was a method of
irrigation in agriculture, much resorted to by the ancients.][Footnote 468: Fierce Cilicians --Ver.The people of the interior
of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, were of rude and savage manners while those
on the coast had been engaged in piracy, until it had been effectually
suppressed by Pompey.][Footnote 469: Britons painted green.--Ver.The Britons may be
called 'virides,' from their island being surrounded by the sea; or,
more probably, from the colour with which they were in the habit of
staining their bodies.Cæsar says, in the Fifth Book of the Gallic war,
'The Britons stain themselves with woad, 'vitrum,' or 'glastum,'
which produces a blue colour: and thus they become of a more dreadful
appearance in battle.'The conquest of Britain, by Cæsar, is alluded to
in the Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 471: Loves the vine.--Ver.The custom of training vines
by the side of the elm, has been alluded to in a previous Note.See also
the Metamorphoses, Book xiv.[Footnote 472: As the nags.--Ver.The'manni' were used by the
Romans for much the same purpose as our coach-horses; and were probably
more noted for their fleetness than their strength; They were a small
breed, originally imported from Gaul, and the possession of them was
supposed to indicate the possession of considerable wealth.As the
'esseda' was a small vehicle, and probably of light structure, we must
not be surprised at Corinna being in the habit of driving for herself.The distance from Rome to Sulmo was about ninety miles: and the journey,
from his expressions in the fifty-first and fifty-second lines, must
have been over hill and dale.][Footnote 473: Your little chaise.--Ver.For an account of the
'essedum,' or 'esseda,' see the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.34,
and the Note to the passage.][Footnote 474: King of Pkthia.--Ver.He alludes to the marriage of
Thetis, the sea Goddess, to Peleus, the king of Phthia, in Thessaly.][Footnote 475: His anvil.--Ver.It is a somewhat curious fact,
that the anvils of the ancients exactly resembled in form and every
particular those used at the present day.][Footnote 476: Becomingly united.--Ver.He says, that in the
Elegiac measure the Pentameter, or line of five feet, is not unhappily
matched with the Hexameter, or heroic line of six feet.][Footnote 477: Disavowed by you.--Ver.'Voids' seems more agreable
to the sense of the passage, than 'nobis.''to be denied by us;' as,
from the context, there was no fear of his declining her affection.][Footnote 478: That she is Corinna.--Ver.This clearly proves that
Corinna was not a real name; it probably was not given by the Poet to
any one of his female acquaintances in particular.][Footnote 479: Thy poem onwards.--Ver.Macer translated the Iliad of
Homer into Latin verse, and composed an additional poem, commencing
at the beginning of the Trojan war, and coming down to the wrath of
Achilles, with which Homer begins.][Footnote 480: I, Macer.--Ver.Æmilius Macer is often mentioned
by Ovid in his works.10,1.41, he says,
'Macer, when stricken in years, many a time repeated to me his poem on
birds, and each serpent that is deadly, each herb that is curative.'The
Tenth Epistle of the Second Book of Pontic Epistles is also addressed to
him, in which Ovid alludes to his work on the Trojan war, and the time
when they visited Asia Minor and Sicily together.He speaks of him in
the Sixteenth Epistle of the Fourth Book, as being then dead.Macer was
a native of Verona, and was the intimate friend of Virgil, Ovid, and
Tibullus.Some suppose that the poet who wrote on natural history, was
not the same with him who wrote on the Trojan war; and, indeed, it does
not seem likely, that he who was an old man in the youth of Ovid, should
be the same person to whom he writes from Pontus, when about fifty-six
years of age.The bard of Ilium died in Asia.][Footnote 481: Tragedy grew apace.--Ver.He alludes to his tragedy
of Medea, which no longer exists.Quintilian thus speaks of it: 'The
Medea of Ovid seems to me to prove how much he was capable of, if he had
only preferred to curb his genius, rather than indulge it.'][Footnote 482: Sabinus return.--Ver.He represents his friend,
Sabinus, here in the character of a 'tabellarius,' or 'letter carrier,'
going with extreme speed (celer) to the various parts of the earth, and
bringing back the answers of Ulysses to Penelope, Hippolytus to Phaedra,
Æneas to Dido, Demophoôn to Phyllis, Jason to Hypsipyle, and Phaon to
Sappho.All these works of Sabinus have perished, except the Epistle of
Ulysses to Penelope, and Demophoôn to Phyllis.His Epistle from Paris
to Oenonc, is not here mentioned.See the Pontic Epistles, Book iv.[Footnote 483: Bring back letters.--Ver.As the ancients had
no establishment corresponding to our posts, they employed special
messengers called 'tabellarii,' for the conveyance of their letters.][Footnote 484: Vowed to Phobus.--Ver.Sappho says in her Epistle,
that if Phaon should refuse to return, she will dedicate her lyre to
Phobus, and throw herself from the Leucadian rock.This, he tells her,
she may now-do, as by his answer Phaon declines to return.][Footnote 485: Pain in her head.--Ver.She pretended a head-ache,
when nothing wras the matter with her; in order that too much
familiarity, in the end, might not breed contempt.][Footnote 486: A surfeit of love.--Ver.'l'inguis amor' seems here
to mear a satisfied 'ora 'pampered passion;' one that meets with no
repulse.][Footnote 487: Enclosed Danaë.--Ver.See the Metamorphoses, Book
iv., 1.][Footnote 488: The dogs bark.--Ver.The women of loose character,
among the Romans, were much in the habit of keeping dogs, for the
protection of their houses.]FOOTNOTES BOOK THREE:

[Footnote 501: Than the other.--Ver.'He alludes to the unequal
lines of the Elegiac measure, which consists of Hexameters and
Pentameters.In personifying Elegy, he might have omitted this remark,
as it does not add to the attractions of a lady, to have one foot longer
than the other; he says, however, that it added to her gracefulness.][Footnote 502: The Lydian buskin.--Ver.As Lydia was said to
have sent colonists to Etruria, some Commentators think that the word
'Lydius' here means 'Etrurian and that the first actors at Rome were
Etrurians.But, as the Romans derived their notions of tragedy from the
Greeks, we may conclude that Lydia in Asia Minor is here referred
to; for we learn from Herodotus and other historians, that the Greeks
borrowed largely from the Lydians.][Footnote 503: Drunken revels.--Ver.He probably alludes to the
Fourth Elegy of the First, and the Fifth Elegy of the Second Book of the
'Amores.']The 'thyrsus' was said to
have been first used by the troops of Bacchus, in his Indian expedition,
when, to deceive the Indians, they concealed the points of their spears
amid leaves of the vine and ivy.Similar weapons were used by his
devotees when worshipping him, which they brandished to and fro.To be
touched with the thyrsus of Bacchus, meant 'to be inspired with poetic
frenzy.'See the Notes to the Metamorphoses, Book iii.[Footnote 506: In unequal numbers.--Ver.Some have supposed, that
allusion is made to the Tragedy of Medea, which Ovid had composed, and
that it had been written in Elegiac measure.This, however, does not
seem to be the meaning of the passage.Elegy justly asks Tragedy, why,
if she has such a dislike to Elegiac verses, she has been talking in
them?which she has done, from the 15th line to the 30th.][Footnote 507: Myself the patroness.--Ver.She certainly does
not give herself a very high character in giving herself the title of
'lena.'][Footnote 508: The fastened door.--Ver.He alludes, probably, to
one of the Elegies which he rejected, when he cut down the five books to
three.][Footnote 509: In a hose tunic.--Ver.He may possibly allude to the
Fifth Elegy of the First Book, as the words 'tunicâ velata recinctâ,' as
applied to Corinna, are there found.But there he mentions midday as the
time when Corinna came to him, whereas he seems here to allude to the
middle of the night.][Footnote 510: Cut in the wood.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
lovers carving inscriptions on the doors of their obdurate mistresses:
this we learn from Plautus to have been done in Elegiac strains, and
sometimes with charcoal.'Implentur meæ fores clegiarum carbonibus.''My
doors are filled with the coal-black marks of elegies.'][Footnote 511: On her birthday.--Ver.She is telling Ovid what she
has put up with for his sake; and she reminds him how, when he sent to
his mistress some complimentary lines on her birthday, she tore them
up and threw them in the water.Horace mentions 'the flames, or the
Adriatic sea,' as the end of verses that displeased.Athenseus, Book
xiii.5, relates a somewhat similai story.Diphilus the poet was in
the habit of sending his verses to his mistress Gnathæna.One day she
was mixing him a cup of wine and snow-water, on which he observed, how
cold her well must be; to which she answered, yes, for it was there that
she used to throw his compositions.][Footnote 514: From behind.--Ver.It is not known, for certain, to
what he refers in this line.Some think that he refers to the succeeding
Elegies in this Book, which are, in general, longer than the former
ones, while others suppose that he refers to his Metamorphoses, which he
then contemplated writing.Burmann, however, is not satisfied with this
explanation, and thinks that, in his more mature years, he contemplated
the composition of Tragedy, after having devoted his youth to lighter
snbjects; and that he did not compose, or even contemplate the
composition of his Metamorphoses, until many years afterwards.][Footnote 515: I am not sitting here.--Ver.He is here alluding to
the Circen-sian games, which were celebrating in the Circus Maximus, or
greatest Circus, at Rome, at different times in the year.Some account
is given of the Circus Maximus in the Note to 1.392. of the Second Book
of the Fasti.The 'Magni,' or Great Circensian games, took place on the
Fourth of the Ides of April.The buildings of the Circus were burnt in
the conflagration of Rome, in Nero's reign; and it was not restored
till the days of Trajan, who rebuilt it with more than its former
magnificence, and made it capable, according to some authors, of
accommodating 385,000 persons.The Poet says, that he takes no
particular interest himself in the race, but hopes that the horse may
win which is her favourite.][Footnote 516: The spirited steeds.--Ver.The usual number of
chariots in each race was four.The charioteers were divided into four
companies, or 'fac-tiones,' each distinguished by a colour, representing
the season of the year.These colours were green for the spring, red for
the summer, azure for the autumn, and white for the winter.Originally,
but two chariots started in each race; but Domitian increased the number
to six, appointing two new companies of charioteers, the golden and the
purple; however the number was still, more usually, restricted to four.The greatest interest was shewn by all classes, and by both sexes, in
the race.Lists of the horses were circulated, with their names and
colours; the names also of the charioteers were given, and bets were
extensively made, (see the Art of Love, Book i.167, 168,) and
sometimes disputes and violent contests arose.][Footnote 517: To be seated by you.--Ver.The men and women sat
together when viewing the contests of the Circus, and not in separate
parts of the building, as at the theatres.][Footnote 518: Happy the driver.--Ver.[Footnote 519: The sacred barrier.--Ver.For an account of the
'career,' or'starting-place,' see the Notes to the Tristia, Book v. El.It is called'sacer,' because the whole of the Circus Maximus
was sacred to Consus, who is supposed by some to have been the same
Deity as Neptune.The games commenced with sacrifices to the Deities.][Footnote 520: I would give rein.--Ver.The charioteer was wont
to stand within the reins, having them thrown round his back.Leaning
backwards, he thereby threw his full weight against the horses, when
he wished to check them at full speed.This practice, however, was
dangerous, and by it the death of Hippolytus was caused.In the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses,1.524, he says, 'I struggled,
with unavailing hand, to guide the bridle covered with white foam, and
throwing myself "backwards, I pulled back the loosened reins.'To avoid
the danger of this practice, the charioteer carried a hooked knife at
his waist, for the purpose of cutting the reins on an emergency.][Footnote 521: The turning-place.--Ver.'see the Tristia, Book iv.Of course, thpse who
kept as close to the'meta' as possible, would lose the least distance
in turning round it.][Footnote 522: How nearly was Pelops.--Ver.In his race with
Onomaüs, king of Pisa, in Arcadia, for the hand of his daughter,
Hippodamia, when Pelops conquered his adversary by bribing his
charioteer, Myrtilus.][Footnote 523: Of his mistress.--Ver.He here seems to imply that
it was Hippodamia who bribed Myrtilus.][Footnote 524: Shrink away in vain.--Ver.She shrinks from him, and
seems to think that he is sitting too close, but he tells her that the
'linea' forces them to squeeze.This 'linea' is supposed to have been
either cord, or a groove, drawn across the seats at regular intervals,
so as to mark out room for a certain number of spectators between each
two 'lineæ.'][Footnote 525: Has this advantage.--Ver.He congratulates himsdf on
the construction of the place, so aptly giving him an excuse for sitting
close to his mistress.][Footnote 526: But do you --Ver.He is pretending to be very
anxious for her comfort, and is begging the person on the other side not
to squeeze so close against his mistress.][Footnote 527: And you as well.--Ver.As in the theatres, the
seats, which were called 'gradas,''sedilia,' or'subsellia,' were
arranged round the course of the Circus, in ascending tiers; the lowest
being, very probably, almost flush with the ground.There were, perhaps,
no backs to the seats, or, at the best, only a slight railing of wood.The knees consequently of those in the back row would be level, and in
juxta-position with the backs of those in front.He is here telling the
person who is sitting behind, to be good enough to keep his knees to
himself, and not to hurt the lady's back by pressing against her.][Footnote 528: I am taking it up.--Ver.He is here showing off his
politeness, and will not give her the trouble of gathering up her dress.Even in those days, the ladies seem to have had no objection to their
dresses doing the work of the scavenger's broom.][Footnote 529: The fleet Atalanta.--Ver.Some suppose that the
Arcadian Atalanta, the daughter of Iasius, was beloved by a youth of the
name of Milanion.According to Apollodorus, who evidently confounds
the Arcadian with the Boeotian Atalanta, Milanion was another name of
Hippo-menes, who conquered the latter in the foot race, as mentioned
in the Tenth Book of the Metamorphoses.See the Translation of the
Metamorphoses, p.From this and another passage of Ovid, we have
reason to suppose that Atalanta was, by tradition, famous for the beauty
of her ancles.][Footnote 530: The fan may cause.--Ver.Instead of the word
'tabella,' 'flabella' has been suggested here; but as the first syllable
is long, such a reading would occasion a violation of the laws of metre,
and 'tabella' is probably correct.It has, however, the same meaning
here as 'flabella it signifying what we should call 'a fan;' in fact,
the 'flabellum' was a 'tabella,' or thin board, edged with peacocks'
feathers, or those of other birds, and sometimes with variegated pieces
of cloth.These were generally waved by female slaves, who were called
'flabelliferæ'; or else by eunuchs or young boys.They were used to cool
the atmosphere, to drive away gnats and flies, and to promote sleep.We here see a gentleman offering to fan a lady, as a compliment; and it
must have been especially grateful amid the dust and heat of the Roman
Circus.That which was especially intended for the purpose of driving
away flies, was called'muscarium.'The use of fans was not confined
to females; as we learn from Suetonius, that the Emperor Augustus had
a slave to fan him during his sleep.The fan was also sometimes made of
linen, extended upon a light frame, and sometimes of the two wings of a
bird, joined back to back, and attached to a handle.][Footnote 531: Now the procession.--Ver.34 All this time they have
been waiting for the ceremony to commence.The 'Pompa,' or procession,
now opens the performance.In this all those who were about to exhibit
in the race took a part.The statues of the Gods were borne on wooden
platforms on the shoulders of men, or on wheels, according as they
were light or heavy.The procession moved from the Capitol, through the
Forum, to the Circus Maximus, and was also attended by the officers of
state.Musicians and dancers preceded the statues of the Gods.[Footnote 532: Victory borne.--Ver.On the wooden platform, which
was called 'ferculum,' or 'thensa,' according as it was small or large.][Footnote 533: With expanded wings.--Ver.Victory was always
represented with expanded wings, on account of her inconstancy and
volatility.][Footnote 534: Salute Neptune.--Ver.'Plaudite Neptuno' is
equivalent, in our common parlance, to 'Give a cheer for Neptune.'He
is addressing the sailors who may be present: but he declines to have
anything to do with the sea himself.][Footnote 535: Arms I detest.--Ver.Like his contemporary, Horace,
Ovid was no lover of war.][Footnote 536: Of the artisan.--Ver.We learn from the Fasti, Book
iii.1.815, that Minerva was especially venerated as the patroness of
handicrafts.][Footnote 537: Let the boxers.--Ver.Boxing was one of the earliest
athletic games practised by the Greeks.Apollo and Hercules, as well as
Pollux, are celebrated by the poets for excelling in this exercise.It formed a portion of the Olympic contests; while boys fought in the
Nemean and Isthmian games.Concerning the 'cæstus' used by pugilists,
see the Fasti, Book ii.The method
in fighting most practised was to remain on the defensive, and thus to
wear out the opponent by continual efforts.To inflict blows, without
receiving any in return on the body, was the great point of merit.The
right arm was chiefly used for attack, while the office of the left was
to protect the body.Teeth were often knocked out, and the ears were
much disfigured.The boxers, by the rules of the game, were not allowed
to take hold of each other, nor to trip up their antagonist.In Italy
boxing seems to have been practised from early times by the people of
Etruria.It continued to be one of the popular games during the period
of the Republic as well as of the Empire.][Footnote 538: In the lattice work.--Ver.The 'cancelli' were
lattice work, which probably fkirted the outer edge of each wide
'præcinctio,' or passage,that ran along in front of the seats, at
certain intervals.As the knees would not there be so cramped, these
seats would be considered the most desirable.It is clear that Ovid and
the lady have had the good fortune to secure front seats, with the feet
resting either on the lowest 'præcinctio', or the 'præcinctio' of a set
of seats higher up.Stools, of course, could not be used, as they would
be in the way of passers-by.He perceives, as the seat is high, that she
has some difficulty in touching the ground with her feet, and naturally
concludes that her legs must ache; on which he tells her, if it will
give her ease, to rest the tips of her feet on the lattice work railing
which was opposite, and which, if they were on an upper 'præcinctio,'
ran along the edge of it: or if they were on the very lowest tier,
skirted the edge of the 'podium' which formed the basis of that tier.This she might do, if the 'præcinctio' was not more than a yard wide,
and if the 'cancelli' were as much as a foot in height.][Footnote 539: Now the Prcetor.--Ver.The course is now clear
of the procession, and the Prætor gives the signal for the start, the
'carceres' being first opened.This was sometimes given by sound of
trumpet, or more frequently by letting fall a napkin; at least, after
the time of Nero, who is said, on one occasion, while taking a meal, to
have heard the shouts of the people who were impatient for the race to
begin, on which he threw down his napkin as the signal.][Footnote 540: The even harriers.--Ver.From this description we
should be apt to think that the start was effected at the instant when
the 'carceres' were opened.This was not the case: for after coming out
of the-carceres,' the chariots were ranged abreast before a white line,
which was held by men whose office it was to do, and who were called
'moratores.'When all were ready, and the signal had been given, the
white line was thrown down, and the race commenced, which was seven
times round the course.The 'career' is called 'æquum,' because they
were in a straight line, and each chariot was ranged in front of the
door of its 'career.'][Footnote 541: Circuit far too wide.--Ver.The charioteer, whom the
lady favours, is going too wide of the'meta,' or turning-place, and so
loses ground, while the next overtakes him.][Footnote 542: To the left.--Ver.He tells him to guide the horses
to the left, so as to keep closer to the'meta,' and not to lose so much
ground by going wide of it.][Footnote 543: Call him back again.--Ver.He, by accident, lets
drop the observation, that they have been interesting themselves for
a blockhead.But he immediately checks himself, and, anxious that the
favourite may yet distinguish himself, trusts that the spectators
will call him back.Crispinus, the Delphin Editor, thinks, that by the
calling back, it is meant that it was a false start, and that the race
was to be run over again.Bur-mann, however, is not of that opinion;
but supposes, that if any chariot did not go well, or the horses seemed
jaded, it was the custom to call the driver back from the present race,
that with new horses he might join in the next race.This, from the
sequel, seems the most rational mode of explanation here.][Footnote 544: Waving the garments.--Ver.The signal for stopping
was given by the men rising and shaking and waving their outer garments,
or 'togae,' and probably calling the charioteer by name.][Footnote 545: Disarrange your hair.--Ver.He is afraid lest her
neighbours, in their vehemence should discommode her hair, and tells
her, in joke, that she may creep into the bosom of his own 'toga.'][Footnote 546: And now the barrier.--Ver.The first race we are to
suppose finished, and the second begins similarly to the first.There
were generally twenty-five of these'missus,' or races in a day.][Footnote 547: The variegated throng.--Ver.[Footnote 548: At all events.--Ver.He addresses the favourite, who
has again started in this race.][Footnote 549: Bears away the palm.--Ver.The favourite charioteer
is now victorious, and the Poet hopes that he himself may gain the palm
in like manner.The victor descended from his car at the end of the
race, and ascended the'spina,' where he received his reward, which was
generally a considerable sum of money.For an account of the'spina,'
see the Metamorphoses, Book x. l.[Footnote 550: Her beauty remains.--Ver.She has not been punished
with ugliness, as a judgment for her treachery.][Footnote 551: Proved false to me.--Ver.Tibullus has a similar
passage, 'Et si perque suos fallax juravit ocellos 'and if with her eyes
the deceitful damsel is forsworn.'][Footnote 552: Its divine sway.--Ver.'Numen' here means a power
equal to that of the Divinities, and which puts it on a level with
them.][Footnote 553: Mine felt pain.--Ver.When the damsel swore by them,
his eyes smarted, as though conscious of her perjury.][Footnote 554: Forsooth to you.--Ver.He says that surely it was
enough for the Gods to punish Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus, for
the sins of her mother, without making him to suffer misery for the
perjury of his mistress.Cassiope, the mother of Andromeda, having dared
to compare her own beauty with that of the Nereids, her daughter was, by
the command of Jupiter, exposed to a sea-monster, which was afterwards
slain by Perseus.[Footnote 555: Hurls at the groves.--Ver.A place which had been
struck by lightning was called 'bidental,' and was held sacred ever
afterwards.The same veneration was also paid to a place where any
person who had been killed by lightning was buried.Priests collected
the earth that had been torn up by lightning, and everything that had
been scorched, and buried it in the ground with lamentations.The spot
was then consecrated by sacrificing a two-year-old sheep, which being
called 'bidens,' gave its name to the place.An altar was also erected
there, and it was not allowable thenceforth to tread on the spot, or
to touch it, or even look at it.When the altar had fallen to decay, it
might be renovated, but to remove its boundaries was deemed sacrilege.Madness was supposed to ensue on committing such an offence; and Seneca
mentions a belief, that wine which had been struck by lightning, would
produce death or madness in those who drank it.][Footnote 556: Unfortunate Semele.--Ver.See the fate of Semele,
related in the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 557: Have some regard.--Ver.'Don't
sweat any more by my eyes.'][Footnote 558: Because she cannot, stilt sews.--Ver.It is not a
little singular that a heathen poet should enunciate the moral doctrine
of the New Testament, that it is the thought, and not the action, that
of necessity constitutes the sin.][Footnote 559: A hundred in his neck.--Ver.In the First Book of
the Metamorphoses, he assigns to Argus only one hundred eyes; here,
however, he uses a poet's license, prohably for the sake of filling up
the line.][Footnote 560: Its stone and its iron.--Ver.From Pausanias and
Lucian we learn that the chamber of Danaë was under ground, and was
lined with copper and iron.][Footnote 561: Nor yet is it legal.--Ver.He tells him that he
ought not to inflict loss of liberty on a free-born woman, a punishment
that was only suited to a slave.][Footnote 562: Those two qualities.--Ver.He says, the wish being
probably the father to the thought, that beauty and chastity cannot
possibly exist together.][Footnote 563: Many a thing at home.--Ver.He tells him that he
will grow quite rich with the presents which his wife will then receive
from her admirers.][Footnote 564: Its bubbling foam..--Ver.He alludes to the noise
which the milk makes at the moment when it touches that in the pail.][Footnote 565: Ewe when milked.--Ver.Probably the milk of ewes was
used for making cheese, as is sometimes the case in this country.][Footnote 566: Hag of a procuress.--Ver.We have been already
introduced to one amiable specimen of this class in the Eighth Elegy of
the First Book.][Footnote 567: River that hast.--Ver.Ciofanus has this interesting
Note:--'This river is that which flows near the walls of Sulmo, and,
which, at the present day we call 'Vella.'In the early spring, when the
snows melt, and sometimes, at the beginning of autumn, it swells to a
wonderful degree with the rains, so that it becomes quite impassable.Ovid lived not far from the Fountain of Love, at the foot of the
Moronian hill, and had a house there, of which considerable vestiges
still remain, and are called 'la botteghe d'Ovidio.'Wishing to go
thence to the town of Sulmo, where his mistress was living, this river
was an obstruction to his passage.'][Footnote 568: A hollow boat.--Ver.'Cymba' was a name given to
small boats used on rivers or lakes.He here alludes to a ferry-boat,
which was not rowed over; but a chain or rope extending from one side of
the stream to the other, the boatman passed across by running his hands
along the rope.][Footnote 569: The opposite mountain.--Ver.The mountain of Soracte
was near the Flaminian way, in the territory of the Falisci, and may
possibly be the one here alluded to.Ciofanus says that its name is now
'Majella,-and that it is equal in height to the loftiest mountains of
Italy, and capped with eternal snow.He means to say that he has risen early in the morning for the purpose
of proceeding on his journey.][Footnote 570: The son of Danaë.--Ver.Mercury was said to have
lent to Perseus his winged shoes, 'talaria,' when he slew Medusa with
her viperous locks.][Footnote 571: Wish for the chariot.--Ver.Ceres was said to have
sent Trip-tolemus in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, to introduce
agriculture among mankind.See the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 572: Inachus.--Ver.Inachus was a river of Argolis, in
Peloponnesus.][Footnote 573: Love for Melie.--Ver.Melie was a Nymph beloved by
Neptune, to whom she bore Amycus, king of Bebrycia, or Bithynia, in Asia
Minor, whence her present appellation.][Footnote 574: Alpheus.--Ver 29.See the story of Alpheus and Arethusa,
in the Fifth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 575: Creüsa.--Ver.Creüsa was a Naïad, the mother of
Hypseas, king of the Lapithae, by Peneus, a river of Thessaly.Xanthus
was a rivulet near Troy.Of Creüsa being promised to Xanthus nothing
whatever is known.][Footnote 576: The be beloved by Mars.--Ver.Pindar, in his Sixth
Olympic Ode, says that Metope, the daughter of Ladon, was the mother of
live daughters, by Asopus, a river of Boeotia.Their names were Corcyra,
Ægina, Salamis, Thebe, and Harpinna.Ovid, in calling her Thebe,
probably follows some other writer.She is called 'Martia,' because she
was beloved by Mars, to whom she bore Evadne.][Footnote 577: Hand of Hercules.--Ver.For the contest of Hercules
and Achelous for the hand of Deianira, see the beginning of the Ninth
Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 578: Calydon.--Ver.Aeneus, the father of Meleager and
Dei'anira, reigned over Ætolia, of which Calydon was the chief city.][Footnote 579: The native spot.--Ver.40; He alludes to the fact of the
source or native country of the Nile being then, as it probably still
is, quite unknown.][Footnote 580: Daughter of Asopus.--Ver.Evadne is called
'Asopide,' from her mother being the wife of Asopus.[Footnote 581: Enipeus dried up.--Ver.Probably the true reading
here is 'fictus,' 'the false Enipeus.'Tyro was the daughter of
Salmoneus, king of Pisa, in Elis.She being much enamoured of the river
Enipeus, Neptune is said to have assumed his form, and to have been, by
her, the father of Pelias and Neleus.'][Footnote 582: Argive Tibur,--Ver.Tibur was a town beautifully
situate in the neighbourhood of Home; it was said to have been founded
by three Argive brothers, Tyburtus, Catillus, and Coras.][Footnote 583: Whom Ilia.--Ver.Ilia was said to have been buried
alive, by the orders of Amulius, on the banks of the river Tiber; or,
according to some, to have been thrown into that river, on which she is
said to have become the wife of the river, and was deified.Acron, an
ancient historian, wrote to the effect that her ashes were interred on
the banks of the Anio; and that river overflowing, carried them to
the bed of the Tiber, whence arose the story of her nuptials with the
latter.According to one account, she was not put to death, but was
imprisoned, having been spared by Amulius at the entreaty of his
daughter, who was of the same age as herself, and at length regained her
liberty.][Footnote 584: Descendant of Laomedon.--Ver.She was supposed to
be descended from Laomedon, through Ascanius, the son of Creüsa, the
granddaughter of Laomedon.][Footnote 585: No white fillet.--Ver.The fillet with which the
Vestals bound their hair.][Footnote 586: Am I courted.--Ver.The Vestais were released from
their duties, and were allowed to marry if they chose, after they had
served for thirty years.The first ten years were passed in learning
their duties, the next ten in performing them, and the last ten in
instructing the novices.][Footnote 587: Did she throw herself.--Ver.The Poet follows the
account which represented her as drowning herself.][Footnote 588: To some fixed rule.--Ver.'Legitimum' means
'according to fixed laws so that it might be depended upon, 'in a steady
manner.'][Footnote 589: Injurious to the flocks.--Ver.It would be
'damnosus' in many ways, especially from its sweeping away the cattle
and the produce of the land.Its waters, too, being turbid, would be
unpalatable to the thirsty traveller, and unwholesome from the melted
snow, which would be likely to produce goitre, or swellings in the
throat.][Footnote 590: Could I speak of the rivers.--Ver.He apologizes to
the Acheloüs, Inachus, and Nile, for presuming to mention their names,
in addressing such a turbid, contemptible stream.][Footnote 591: After my poems.--Ver.He refers to his lighter works;
such, perhaps, as the previous books of his Amores.This explains
the nature of the 'libelli,' which he refers to in his address to his
mistress, in the Second Book of the Amores, El.[Footnote 592: His wealth acquired.--Ver.For the
explanation of this word, see the Fasti, B. i.217, and the Note to
the passage.][Footnote 593: Through his wounds.--Ver.In battle, either by giving
wounds, or receiving them.][Footnote 594: Which thus late.--Ver.By 4 serum,'he means that
his position, as a man of respectable station, has only been recently
acquired, and has not descended to him through a long line of
ancestors.][Footnote 595: Was it acquired.--Ver.This was really much to
the merit of his rival; but most of the higher classes of the Romans
affected to despise anything like gain by means of bodily exertion; and
the Poet has extended this feeling even to the rewards of merit as a
soldier.][Footnote 596: Hold sway over.--Ver.He here plays upon the two
meanings of the word 'deducere.''Deducere carmen' is 'to compose
poetry'; 'deducere primum pilum' means 'to form' or 'command the first
troop of the Triarii.'These were the veteran soldiers of the Roman
army, and the 'Primipilus' (which office is here alluded to) being the
first Centurion of the first maniple of them, was the chief Centurion of
the legion, holding an office somewhat similar to our senior captains.See the Note to the
49th line of the Seventh Epistle, in the-Fourth Book of the Pontic
Epistles.][Footnote 597: The ravished damsel.--Ver.[Footnote 598: Resorted to presents.--Ver.He seems to allude to
the real meaning of the story of Danaë, which, no doubt, had reference
to the corrupting influence of money.][Footnote 599: With no boundaries.--Ver.The 'limes' was a line
or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and
consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones.The 'ager limitatus'
was the public land marked out by 'limites,' for the purposes of
allotment to the citizens.On apportioning the land, a line, which was
called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East to West, which
was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from North to South.The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn depended on the
magnitude of the squares or 'centuriæ,' as they were called, into which
it was purposed to divide the tract.][Footnote 601: Then was the shore.--Ver.Because they had not as
yet learnt the art of navigation.][Footnote 602: Turreted fortifications.--Ver.Among the ancients
the fortifications of cities were strengthened by towers, which were
placed at intervals on the walls; they were also generally used at the
gates of towns.][Footnote 603: Why not seek the heavens.--Ver.With what indignation
would he not have spoken of a balloon, as being nothing less than a
downright attempt to scale the 'tertia régna!'][Footnote 604: Ciesar but recently.--Ver.See the end of the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, and the Fasti, Book iii.[Footnote 605: The Senate-house.--Ver.'Curia'was the name of the
place where the Senate held its meetings, such as the 'curia Hostilia,'
* Julia,' Marcelli,' and others.Hence arose the custom of calling the
Senate itself, in the various Roman towns, by the name of 'curia,' but
not the Senate of Rome.He here means to say, that poverty excluded a
man from the Senate-house, and that wealth alone was the qualification
for the honours of the state.][Footnote 606: Wealth alone confers honours --Ver.The same
expression occurs in the Fasti, Book i.'217, where a similar
complaint is made on the worldly-mindedness of the age.][Footnote 607: The Field of Mars.--Ver.The 'comitia,' or meetings
for the elections of the magistrates, were held on the 'Campus Martius'
or field of Mars.See the Notes to the Fasti, Book i.The 'Fora' were of two kinds
at Rome; some being market-places, where all kinds of goods were exposed
for sale, while others were solely courts of justice.Among the latter
is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as
it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after
that period, as in the present instance.At a later period of the
Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial
purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets
'vetus,' 'old,' or'magnum, 'great.'It was situate between the
Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh,
which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius.It was chiefly used for
judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with
the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.'Gladiatorial games were
occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless
legionary soldiers, were there put to death.A second 'Forum,' for
judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his
name.It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix.A third
was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned
with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men
of the republic.Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was
restored by the Emperor Hadrian.It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of
the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver.He says that because he is
poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband
and those whom he has set to watch her.][Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver.Burmann remarks, that
the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods;
literally 'the priest of thy rites.'][Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver.Among the Romans the corpse
was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.'According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy
the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed
by the Latin writers.]It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in
height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the
deceased.On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had
been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands,
were thrown upon it.Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were
sometimes used for the same purpose.This was done not only by the
family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral
procession.][Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver.He alludes to the death of
Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh.See the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, l.[Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver.In the Sixth Book of
the Fasti, 1.'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under
his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the
impregnating.particles of the mind of the Divinity.'][Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver.It must be remembered that,
whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans
represented the grim tyrant as being a female.It is a curious fact
that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman
monuments.The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found
represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii.The head of a horse was
one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified
departure.][Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver.Apollo and the Muse Calliope
were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death.See the
beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.]'Ælinon' was said to have been
the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus.The
word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas!A certain
poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus,
that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects.There appear to
have been two persons of the name of Linus.One was a Theban, the son of
Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was
the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was
torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.][Footnote 617: The son of Mæon.See the Note to the ninth
line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.][Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver.[Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver.Nemesis and Delia were the
names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.][Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver.He alludes to two lines
in the]

First Elegy of Tibullus.]'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia?quid mihi prosunt]

Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.']What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis?what avail me those sistra
so often shaken by your hand?'][Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver.During the festival of Isis,
all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.][Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver.The place where a person was
burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot,
and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place.See
the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii.[Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver.He alludes to Venus, who
had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.][Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver.The Phæacians were the
ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu.Tibullus had attended
Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on
his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his
Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among
the Phæacians.Tibullus afterwards
recovered, and died at Rome.When he penned this line, Ovid little
thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble
spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
civilization.]1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable
reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.][Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.][Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver.The perfumes and other
offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to.Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--]

'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,]

Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis']

'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes,
and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.'To this passage Ovid
makes reference in the next two lines.][Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver.'Prior;' his former love was
Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis.They are both represented
here as attending his obsequies.Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of
the First Book, addressing Delia:--]

1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,]

Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.]Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,]

Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.']May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you
with my failing hand.Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my
bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears
of grief.'It would appear
from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss
when the body was laid on the funeral pile.][Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver.Nemesis here alludes
to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his
affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.][Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver.Catullus was a Roman poet, a
native of Verona.Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit.The poems
of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and
Demetrius, who were famous composers.lines
427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.][Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver.He alludes to the fact
of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected
of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of
kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii.446, that the
fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when
he was in a state o* inebriety.Some writers say, that when Governor of
Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids,
and that this constituted his crime.Others again, suppose that he was
guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people
of Thebea with his exactions.Some of the Commentators think that under
the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it
woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known
to have existed.Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some
misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in
which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.][Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver.This festival of Ceres
occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that
month.White garments, were worn at this
festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited.The worship
was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was
forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.][Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver.On the oaks, the
oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253
and 467.][Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver.See an account of the
education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, L 499, et seq.][Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver.Iasius, or Iasion, was,
according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed
the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus.According
to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph
Phronia.According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of
Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.He was also said by some to
be the husband of Cybele.He is supposed to have been a successful
husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is
thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia,
Book ii.[Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver.With less corn than
had been originally sown.][Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver.Minos is said to have
been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.][Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver.This figure is derived
from the horns, the weapons of the bull.'At length I have assumed the
weapons of defence.'It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's
Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.'I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!][Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver.He addresses himself,
recommending fortitude as his only cure.][Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver.At the door of his mistress;
a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman
lovers.][Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver.As, of courser, his rival
would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.][Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver.By the use of the word
'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which
were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.][Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver.This forms the subject of
the Third Elegy of the present Book.][Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver.See the Fifth Elegy of
the Second Book of the Amores.][Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver.When he arrived, he found his
rival in her company.][Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver.This and the next line are
considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.][Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver.Commentators are at a
loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other
mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book,
when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses.If Corinna was
anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not
meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was
meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been
recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.][Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver.He says that, unconsciously,
he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending
his mistress to the public.The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed
in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of
sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered
for sale.These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far
as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the
'magister auctionum.'The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence
in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to
summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors
in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals,
to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry
them and search for them.The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of
Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.][Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver.He speaks of the Theban war, the
Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic
poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time
in singing in praise of Corinna.This, however, may be said in reproof
of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that
Corinna is the cause of his present complaint.The Roman poet Statius
afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.][Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver.That is, 'to rely
implicitly on the testimony of poets.'The word 'poetas' requires a
semicolon after it, and not a comma.][Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver.He here falls into his usual
mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the
Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth
Books of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the
Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,
by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used
the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion.It has been
suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but
that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is
not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.][Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver.Tityus was a giant, the son
of Jupiter and Elara.Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the
darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was
doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.][Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver.He was the son of Titan and Terra,
and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning,
and thrown beneath Mount Ætna.See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.[Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver.He evidently alludes
to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have
imagined.][Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver.Æolus gave Ulysses
favourable wind* sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to
Ithaca.See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv.223]

[Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver.He calls Philomela the
daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been
the first king of Athens.Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver.He alludes to the
transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in
the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.][Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver.He alludes to the dragon's
teeth sown by Cadmus.See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver.Reference is made to the
transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled
amber.See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver.He alludes to the ships
of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea
Nymphs.][Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver.Reference is made to the
revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them
on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have
hidden his face.][Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver.Amphion is said to
have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.][Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver.Marcus Furius Camillus, the

Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her;

Egypt and Libya.[Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver.This is similar to the alleged
origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday.The
Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors,
the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune
crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers
were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.][Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver.As'vestis' was a general name

Confederate confronted him.This man's attention had been attracted for
a moment to the fate of his comrades in the road, and before he knew it
Fred was on him.He raised his smoking revolver to fire, but Fred's
revolver spoke first, and the soldier reeled and fell from his saddle.The road was now open for Fred to escape, but he wheeled his horse and
rode back to see what had become of his comrade.One Confederate still
sat on his horse unhurt.Seeing Fred, he raised his pistol and fired.Fred felt his left arm grow numb, and then a sensation like that of hot
water running down the limb.Before the soldier could fire the second
time, a ball from Fred's pistol crashed through his brain, and he fell,
an inert mass, in the road.Of the two Confederates overthrown in the wild charge of Ferror, one was
dead, the other was untouched by bullets, but lay groaning with a
broken leg and arm.He lay partly
under his horse, his eyes closed, his bosom stained with blood.[Illustration: Fred raised his Head, "Ferror!"It's all right, Fred--all right,"
he gasped."That was no murder--that was a fair fight, wasn't it?""It is better as it is, Fred.He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was with a far-away
look."Yes, mother," he whispered, and then
his eyes closed forever.The clatter of horses' hoofs, and the clang of sabers were now heard.Fred looked up; a party of Federal cavalry was bearing down upon him.They looked on the bloody scene in astonishment.A dashing young captain
rode up.Fred pointed to young Ferror's lifeless body, and said: "Bring
his body back to Piketon with you.I am one of
General Nelson's scouts."Then everything grew black before him, and he knew no more.He had
fainted from the loss of blood.The rough troopers bound up his arm, staunched the flow of blood, and
soon Fred was able to ride to Piketon.General Nelson received him with
astonishment; yet he would not let him talk, but at once ordered him to
the hospital.As for Robert Ferror, he was given a soldier's burial.A year after the war closed, Frederic Shackelford, a stalwart young man,
sought out the home of Mrs.He found a gray-haired,
brokenhearted mother and two lovely young ladies, her daughters.They
had mourned the son and brother, not only as dead, but as forever
disgraced, for they had been told that Robert had been shot for
desertion.Fred gave them the little mementoes he had kept through the years for
them.He told them how Robert had given his life to try and save him,
and that the last word that trembled on his lips was "Mother."The gray-haired mother lifted her trembling hands, and thanked God that
her son had at least died the death of a soldier.Learning that the family had been impoverished by the war, when Fred
left, he slipped $1,000 in Mrs.Ferror's hand, and whispered, "For
Robert's sake;" and the stricken mother, through tear-dimmed eyes,
watched his retreating form, and murmured: "And Robert would have been
just such a man if he had lived."CRAZY BILL SHERMAN.The ball had gone through the
fleshy part of the arm, causing a great loss of blood; but no bones were
broken, and it was only a question of a few weeks before he would be as
well as ever.The story of the two boys charging four Confederate cavalrymen, killing
three, and disabling the fourth was the wonder of the army.But Fred
modestly disclaimed any particular bravery in the affair."It is to poor Bob Ferror that the honor should be given," he would say;
"the boy that knowingly rode to his death that I might be saved."Fred gave General Nelson the particulars of his capture and escape, and
the general looked grave and said:

"If I had known I was going to place you in such extreme danger, I
should not have sent for you.On account of the crime of young Ferror,
you would have met with a most ignominious death if you had been
recaptured; yet the charging on those four cavalrymen was one of the
pluckiest things I have heard of during the war.You deserve and shall
have a good rest.I have just finished making up some dispatches for
General Sherman, and you shall be my messenger.A dispatch boat leaves
in the morning, and you shall go with it.When you get to Catlettsburg,
you can take an Ohio river steamer for Louisville.The trip being all by
water, will be an easy one, and as a number of sick and wounded will be
sent away on the same boat, you will have good surgical attendance for
your wounded arm.Here is a paper that will admit you to the officers'
hospital when you get to Louisville.I do
not think it will be long before I, with my command, will be ordered
back to Louisville.The enemy has retreated through Pound Gap into
Virginia, and there is nothing more for me to do here.Stay in
Louisville until you hear from me."The next morning found Fred on his way down the Big Sandy.The whole
voyage was uneventful, and after a quick trip Fred once more found
himself in Louisville.The rest and quiet of the voyage had almost cured
the ill-effects of his experience, and with the exception of his wounded
arm, which he was compelled to carry in a sling, he was feeling about as
well as ever.Once in Louisville, he lost no time in turning over his dispatches to
General Sherman.He found the general surrounded by a delegation of the
prominent Union men of the city.They seemed to be arguing with Sherman
about something, and as for the general, he was in a towering rage, and
was swearing in a manner equal to General Nelson in one of his outbreaks
of anger.Fred was surprised to find the usually mild and gentlemanly officer in
such a passion, but there was no mistake, he was angry clear through."There is no use talking, gentlemen," he was saying, as he paced the
room with quick nervous tread, "I am not only going to resign, but I
have already sent in my resignation.I will not remain in command of the
Department of Kentucky another day; the command of the armies of the
United States would not induce me to remain and be insulted and outraged
as I have been.""We are very sorry to hear it, General," replied the spokesman of the
delegation."We had great hopes of what you would accomplish when you
were appointed to the command of the department, and our confidence in
you is still unabated.""I am thankful," replied the general, "for that confidence, but what can
you expect of a man bound hand and foot.They seem to know a great deal
better in Washington what we need here than we do who are on the ground.This, in a measure, is to be expected; but to be reviled and insulted is
more than I can stand.But if I had not resigned, I should be removed, I
know that.Just let the newspapers begin howling at a general, and
denouncing him, and every official at Washington begins shaking in his
boots.What can be expected of a general with every newspaper in the
land yelping at his heels like a pack of curs?If I wanted to end this
war quickly, I would begin by hanging every editor who would publish a
word on how the war should be conducted."Are you not a little too severe on the newspaper fraternity, General?"mildly put in one of the citizen delegates.They think
they know more about war, and how to conduct campaigns than all the
military men of the country combined.Not satisfied with telling me how
and when to conduct a campaign, they attack me most unjustly and
cruelly, attack me in such a manner I cannot reply.Just listen to
this," and the general turned and took up a scrapbook in which numerous
newspaper clippings had been pasted."Here is an editorial from that
esteemed and influential paper, _The Cincinnati Commerce_," and the
general read:

"'It is a lamentable fact that many of our generals are grossly
incompetent, but when incipient insanity is added to incompetency, it is
time to cry a halt.Right here at home, the general who commands the
Department of Kentucky and therefore has the safety of our city in his
hands, is W. T. Sherman.We have it on the most reliable evidence that
he is of unsound mind.Not only do many of his sayings excite the pity
of his friends and ridicule of his enemies, but they are positively
dangerous to the success of our cause.The Government should at least
put the department in charge of a general of sound mind.'"Now, if that is not enough," continued the general, with a touch of
irony in his tones, "I will give you a choice clipping from the great
_New York Tricate_."'It is with sorrow that we learn that General W. T. Sherman, who is in
command of the Department of Kentucky, is not in his right mind.It is
said that the authorities at Washington have been aware of this for some
time, but for political reasons fear to remove him.He is a brother of
John Sherman, one of the influential politicians of Ohio, and United
States Senator-elect.While the affair is to be regretted, the
Government should not hesitate on account of political influence.That he is mentally unsound
is admitted, even by his best friends.The whole company was smiling at the absurdity of the affair."I will read once more," said the general."It is from the _Chicago
Timer_, and hits others as well as myself.Here it is:

"'General Bill Sherman, in command of the Department of Kentucky, is
said to be insane.In our mind the whole Lincoln
Government, from President down, is insane--insane over the idea that
they can coerce the South back into the Union.The only difference that
we can see is that Bill Sherman may be a little crazier than the rest;
that's all.'"There," continued the general, "are only a few of the scores of
extracts which I have from the most influential papers in the land.Of
course the smaller papers have taken their cue from the larger ones, and
now the whole pack of little whiffets are after me, snapping at my
heels; and the good people believe the story because it is published.Hundreds of letters are being received at Washington, asking for my
removal.My brother writes that he is overwhelmed with inquiries
concerning me.I believe the War Department more than half believes I am
of unsound mind.They are only waiting for an excuse to get rid of me,
and I know that my resignation will be received with joy.""General," asked one of the citizens present, "have you any idea of how
the story of your insanity started?""When Secretary of War Cameron was here,
I laid before him the wants of Kentucky, and among other things said
that I needed 60,000 men for defensive work, but for offensive
operations I should need 200,000.The Secretary spoke of it as an
'insane request.'Some reporter got hold of it, and then it went.The
Secretary has never taken the pains to correct the impressions.""Were you not a little extravagant in your demands?"The politicians at Washington have never yet recognized
the magnitude of the war in which we are engaged.Then their whole life
is office, and they are afraid of doing something that will lose them a
vote.As for the newspapers, they would rather print a sensation than
have us win a victory.They have called me crazy so much they
have alarmed my wife," and the general again indulged in another burst
of anger.When he became calmer, he said: "Gentlemen, I thank you for
your expressions of sympathy and confidence.I trust my successor will
be more worthy than I," and he bowed the delegation out.The general noticed him, and asked: "Well, my
boy, what is it?Why, bless my soul, it's Fred Shackelford!"Yes, General, with dispatches," and he handed them to him."I will read them when I cool off a little; I have been rather warm.I
see your arm is in a sling; been in a skirmish?"The wound didn't amount to much; it is
nearly well.""You should be thankful it is no worse.Come in in the morning, Fred; I
will have the dispatches read by that time."Fred called, as requested, the next morning, and found the general calm
and courteous as ever."General Nelson writes good news," said Sherman."He reports he has
entirely driven the Rebels out of the valley of the Big Sandy.He also
tells me in a private letter of your capture and escape.He speaks of
the desperate conflict that you and your comrade had with four Rebel
cavalrymen.My boy, I shall keep my
eye on you.I surely should ask for your services myself if I were going
to remain in command of the department.""General, I am sorry to have you resign," answered Fred, hardly knowing
what to say.The general's face darkened, and then he answered lightly: "I do not
think they will be sorry at Washington."And they were not; his resignation was gladly accepted, and the general
who afterward led his victorious army to Atlanta, and then made his
famous march to the sea, and whose fame filled the world, retired under
a cloud.And the injustice of it rankled in his breast and imbittered
his heart for months.The general appointed to succeed Sherman was Don Carlos Buell, a
thorough soldier, and, like McClellan, a splendid organizer; but, like
that general, he was unsuccessful in the field, and during what is known
as the "Bragg-Buell campaign" in Kentucky in the fall of 1862, he
entirely lost the confidence of his soldiers.Buell's first attention was given to the organization of his army and
the drilling of his soldiers.His labors in this direction were very
successful, and the "Army of the Cumberland" became famous for its
_esprit de corps_.General Nelson, according to his predictions, was ordered back with his
command to Louisville.Fred, now entirely well, was greatly rejoiced to
once more see his old commander.But there was little prospect of active
service, for the division was ordered into camp for the purpose of
drilling and being perfected in military duties.Idleness was irksome to
Fred, so he asked and obtained permission to join General Thomas, and
remain until such time as Nelson might need his services.General Thomas gave Fred a most cordial reception.There was something
about the handsome, dashing boy that greatly endeared him to the staid,
quiet general.Just now, Fred's presence was very desirable, for
Zollicoffer was proving very troublesome, threatening first one point
and then another, and it was almost impossible to tell which place was
in the most danger.General Thomas' forces were greatly scattered,
guarding different points, and he feared that at some of these places
his troops might be attacked and overpowered.He had asked permission of
Buell time and again to be allowed to concentrate his forces and strike
Zollicoffer a telling blow, but each and every time had met with a
refusal.Instead of being allowed to concentrate his force, he was
ordered to move portions of his command here and there, and the orders
of one day might be countermanded the next.Being December, the roads
were in a horrible condition, and it was almost impossible to move
trains, so that his army was being reduced by hard service which did no
good.He would sit for
hours buried in thought or poring over maps.All this time, Zollicoffer was ravaging the middle southern counties of
Kentucky, threatening first London, then Somerset, then Columbia, then
some intermediate point.The outposts of the army were often attacked,
and frequent skirmishes took place.In the midst of this activity, Fred
found congenial employment.He was kept busy carrying dispatches from
one post to another, or on scouting expeditions, trying to gain
information of the movements of the enemy.He frequently met squads of
the enemy, and had many narrow escapes from capture; but the fleetness
of his horse always saved him.Of all General Thomas' scouts, Fred obtained the most valuable
information.While not venturing into the enemy's lines, he had a way of
getting information out of the inhabitants friendly to the South that
surprised even the general.Fred hardly ever made a mistake as to the
movements of the opposing army.If there was one thing that he loved more than another it was his horse.He had trained him to do anything that a horse could do.At a word he
would lie down and remain as motionless as if dead.He would go anywhere
he was told without hesitating, and his keen ear would detect the
presence of an enemy quicker than the ear of his master.Fred had also
perfected himself in the use of a revolver until he was one of the best
shots in the army.He could ride by a tree at full gallop, and put three
balls in a three-inch circle without checking his speed."My life," he would say, "may depend on my being able to shoot quickly
and accurately."On some of his scouts Fred would take a party with him, and there was
not a soldier who did not consider it one of the greatest honors to be
thus chosen.One day near the close of the year Fred was scouting with a picked
force of five men a few miles to the east and south of Somerset.As they
were riding through a piece of wood, Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up
his ears, listened a moment, and then turned and looked at his master,
as if to say, "Danger ahead!""To cover, boys," said Fred, in a low tone.The party turned aside into the wood, and was soon completely hidden
from view."Steady now," said Fred; "no noise.""Are you sure your horse is as wise as you think?""Perfectly sure; Prince never makes a mistake.The trampling of horses, and the jingling of sabers could plainly be
heard, and soon a party of nine Confederate cavalrymen came riding by.They had no thought of danger, and were laughing and talking, thinking
not that death lurked so near them."The old traitor lives right ahead," they heard one say."We will learn him to harbor East Tennessee bridge-burners," said the
leader with a coarse laugh."Will it be hanging or shooting, Sergeant?"It's such fun to see a Lincolnite hanging by the neck
and dancing on air.Never shoot a man if you can hang him, is my motto."Fred's men heard this conversation with lowering brows, and the
muttered curses were deep if not loud, and five carbines were raised,
but with a gesture Fred motioned them down.His men looked at him in
astonishment, and there was disappointment on every face.As soon as the Confederates were out of hearing, so it was safe to
speak, one of the men said with a sigh:

"Capt'in,"--the soldiers always called Fred captain when they were out
with him--"I would hev give five dollars for a shot.I would hev fetched
that feller that loved to see hangin', sure.""I have strict orders," replied Fred, "to avoid fighting when I am out
on these scouting expeditions.It is the part of a good scout never to
get into a fight except to avoid capture.A scout is sent out to get
information, not to fight; a conflict defeats the very object he has in
view.""That's so, capt'in, but it goes agin the grain to let them fellers
off.""I may have made a mistake," replied Fred, "in letting those fellows
off.Come to think about it, I do not like what they said."Worse than that, capt'in.""We will follow them up," said Fred, "as far as we can unobserved.You
remember we passed a pretty farmhouse some half a mile back; that may be
the place they were talking about.We can ride within three hundred
yards of it under cover of the forest."Riding carefully through the wood, they soon came in sight of the
place.Surely enough, the Confederates had stopped in front of the
house.Four of them were holding the horses, while the other five were
not to be seen.As they sat looking the muffled sound of two shots were
heard, and then the shrieking of women."Boys," said Fred, in a strained voice, "I made a mistake in not letting
you shoot.There are
nine of them; we are six.shouted every one, their eyes blazing with excitement."Then for God's sake, forward, or we will be too late!"for the frenzied
shrieks of women could still be heard.They no sooner broke cover, than the men holding the horses discovered
them, and gave the alarm.The five miscreants who were in the house came
rushing out, and all hastily mounting their horses, rode swiftly away.The Federals, with yells of vengeance, followed in swift pursuit; yet in
all probability the Confederates would have escaped if it had not been
for the fleetness of Prince.Fred soon distanced all of his companions,
and so was comparatively alone and close on the heels of the enemy.They noticed this, and conceived the idea that they could kill or
capture him.Fred was watching for this very
thing, and as they stopped he fired, just as the leader's horse was
broadside to him.Then at the word, Prince turned as quick as a flash,
and was running back.The movement was so unexpected to the Confederates
that the volley they fired went wild.As for the horse of the Confederate leader, it reared and plunged, and
then fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground.Two of his men
dismounted to help him.When he got to his feet, he saw that Fred's
companions had joined him and that they all were coming on a charge.Now, boys, stand firm; there are only six of them.But it takes men of iron nerve to stand still and receive a charge, and
the Federals were coming like a whirlwind.The Confederates emptied their revolvers at close range, and then half
of them turned to flee.It was too late; the Federals were among them,
shooting, sabering, riding them down.When it was over, eight Confederates lay dead or desperately wounded.Of
the six Federals, two were dead and two were wounded.Only one
Confederate had escaped to carry back the story of the disaster.[Illustration: The Federals were among them, shooting, sabering, riding
them down.]One of the wounded Confederates lay groaning and crying with pain, and
Fred going up to him, asked if he could do anything for him.The man looked up, and then a scowl of hate came over his face.he groaned, and then with an oath said: "I will have
you if I die for it," and attempted to raise his revolver, which he
still clutched.As quick as a flash Fred knocked it out of his hand, and as quick one of
Fred's men had a revolver at the breast of the desperate Confederate.Fred knocked the weapon up, and the shot passed harmlessly over the head
of the wounded man."None of that, Williams," said Fred."We cannot afford to kill wounded
men in cold blood.""But the wretch would have murdered you, capt'in," said Williams, and
then a cry went up from all the men.Fred looked at the man closely, and then said: "You are Bill Pearson,
the man I struck with my riding-whip at Gallatin.""You miserable wretch," said Fred, contemptuously."By good rights I
ought to blow your brains out, but your carcass is not worth the powder.Just then Fred noticed a countryman who had been attracted by the sound
of the firing, and motioned to him to approach.He came up trembling,
and looked with wonder on the dead men and horses."My good man," said Fred, "here are some wounded men that should be
looked after.Can you not do it, or get word to their command?""I reckon I kin," slowly replied the countryman."Yes," replied Fred; "and this reminds me, boys, we had better get away
from here.We do not know how many of the enemy may be near."The wounds of the two Federals who had been hurt were bound up, and they
were helped on their horses.The bodies of the two dead were then
tenderly placed on two of the Confederate horses which were unhurt, and
the mournful cavalcade slowly moved away.Going back to the house which the Confederates had entered, a
distressing sight met their view.On a bed, the master of the house lay dead, shot to death by the
murderers.By the bedside stood the wife and two daughters, weeping and
wringing their hands.The face of the widow was covered with blood, and
there was a deep gash on her head where one of the wretches had struck
her with the butt of his revolver, as she clung to him imploring him not
to murder her husband.The pitiful sight drove Fred's men wild, and he had all that he could do
to prevent them from going back and finishing the wounded murderers."You did wrong, capt'in, in not letting me finish that red-handed
villain who tried to shoot you," said Williams.With broken sobs the woman told her story.Her husband had a brother in
East Tennessee, who had been accused by the Confederate authorities of
helping burn railroad bridges.He escaped with a number of Union men,
and was now a captain in one of the Tennessee regiments."They came here," said the woman, "and found my husband sick in bed, so
sick he could not raise a finger to help himself.They accused him of
harboring his brother, and of furnishing information, and said that they
had come to hang him, but as he was sick they would shoot him.And
then," sobbed the woman, "notwithstanding our prayers, they shot him
before our eyes.and the stricken wife broke
completely down, and the daughters hung over the body of their murdered
father, weeping as if their hearts would break.He told the sobbing women that he would at once
report the case, and have her husband's brother come out with his
company."We will also," said Fred, "leave the bodies of our two dead
comrades here.If you wish, I will send a chaplain, that all may have
Christian burial.And, my poor woman, your wrongs have been fearfully
avenged.Of the nine men in the party that murdered your husband, but
one escaped.said the women, raising their streaming eyes to
heaven.Even the presence of death did not take away their desire for
revenge.Such is poor human nature, even in gentle woman."War makes demons of us all," thought Fred.The story of that fight was long a theme around the camp fire, and the
three soldiers who survived never tired of telling it.As for Fred, he
spoke of it with reluctance, and could not think of it without a
shudder.Fifteen men never engaged in a bloodier conflict, even on the
"dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky.THE MEETING OF THE COUSINS.General Thomas sat in his headquarters at Lebanon looking over some
dispatches which Fred had just brought from General Schoepf at Somerset.His face wore a look of anxiety as he read, for the dispatches told him
that General Zollicoffer had crossed to the north side of the Cumberland
river and was fortifying his camp at Beech Grove."I may be attacked at any moment," wrote General Schoepf, "and you know
how small my force is.For the love of heaven, send me reinforcements."The general sat with his head bowed in his hands thinking of what could
be done, when an orderly entered with dispatches from Louisville.Daniel went to the kitchen.Thomas
opened them languidly, for he expected nothing but the old story of
keeping still and doing nothing.Suddenly his face lighted up; his whole
countenance beamed with satisfaction, and turning to Fred he said:

"My boy, here is news for us, indeed.General Buell has at last
consented to advance.He has given orders for me to concentrate my army
and attack Zollicoffer at the earliest possible moment.""General," he exclaimed, "I already see Zollicoffer defeated, and hurled
back across the Cumberland.""Don't be too sanguine, Fred," he said; "none of
us know what the fortune of war may be; we can only hope for the best.But this means more work for you, my boy.You will at once have to
return with dispatches to General Schoepf.Somerset must be held at all hazards.""I am ready to start this minute with such tidings," gayly responded
Fred."Prince, poor fellow, will have it the hardest, for the roads are
awful.""That is what I am afraid of," replied the general."I hope to be with
Schoepf within a week, but, owing to the condition of the roads, it may
take me much longer."Within an hour Fred was on his way back to Somerset.It was a terrible
journey over almost impassable roads; streams, icy cold, had to be
forded; but boy and horse were equal to the occasion, and in three days
reached Somerset.He
commenced his march from Lebanon on December 31st; it was January 18th
before he reached his destination.The
rain poured in torrents, and small streams were turned into raging
rivers.Bridges were swept away, and had to be rebuilt.The soldiers,
benumbed with chilling rain, toiled on over the sodden roads, cheerful
in the thought that they were soon to meet the enemies of their country.General Schoepf received the news of General Thomas' advance with great
satisfaction."If I can only hold on," he said, "until Thomas comes, everything will
be all right.""We must show a bold front, General," replied Fred, "and make the enemy
believe we have a large force.""It's the enemy that is showing a bold front nowadays," replied General
Schoepf, with a faint smile."They have been particularly saucy lately.They have in the last few days, cut off two or three small scouting
parties.But what worries me the most is that there is hardly a night
but that every man on some one of our picket posts is missing.There is
no firing, not the least alarm of any kind, but the men in the morning
are gone.It is a mystery we have tried to solve in vain.At first we
thought the men had deserted, but we have given that idea up.The men
are getting superstitious over the disappearance of so many of their
comrades, and are actually becoming demoralized.""General, will you turn this picket business over to me?""I have heard much of your ability in
ferreting out secret matters.Your success as a scout I am well
acquainted with, as you know.I hope you will serve me as well in this
matter of the pickets, for I am at my wits' end.""Well, General, to-morrow I will be at your service, and I trust you
will lose no more pickets before that time," and so saying Fred took his
leave, for he needed rest badly.The next morning, when Fred went to pay his respects to the general, he
found him with a very long face."Another post of four men disappeared
last night," he said."Well, General, if possible, I will try and
solve the problem, but it may be too hard for me.""Have you any idea yet how they are captured?"I must first look over the ground carefully, see how the
men are posted, talk with them, and then I may be able to form an idea."Fred's first business was to ride out to where the post had been
captured during the night.This he did, noting the lay of the ground,
carefully looking for footprints not only in front, but in the rear of
where the men had been stationed.He then visited all the picket posts,
talked with the men, learned their habits on picket, whether they were
as watchful as they should be--in fact, not the slightest thing of
importance escaped his notice.On his return from his tour of inspection, Fred said to General
Schoepf, "Well, General, I have my idea.""Your pickets have been captured from the rear, not the front.""I mean that some of the pickets are so placed that a wary foe could
creep in between the posts and come up in the rear, completely
surprising the men.I think I found evidence that the men captured last
night were taken in that way.I found, at least, six posts of which I
believe an enemy could get in the rear without detection, especially if
the land had been spied out.""You astonish me," said the general."But even if this is so, why does
not the sentinel give the alarm?""He may be in such a position that he dare not," answered Fred."That a double force be put on the posts, half to watch the rear.It
will be my business to-night to see to that.""Very well," replied General Schoepf."I shall be very curious to see
how the plan works, and whether your idea is the correct one or not.""I will not warrant it, General," replied Fred, "but there will be no
harm in trying."Just before night Fred made a second round of the picket posts, and
made careful inquiry whether any one of the posts had been visited
during the day by any one from the outside.All of the posts answered in the negative save one.The corporal of that
post said: "Why, a country boy was here to sell us some vegetables and
eggs.""Was he a bright boy, and did he seem to notice
things closely?""On the contrary," said the corporal, "he appeared to be remarkably dull
and ignorant.""Has the same boy been in the habit of selling vegetables to the
pickets?"Come to think about it, the corporal believed he had heard such a boy
spoken of.Then one of the men spoke up and said:

"You know Rankin was on the post that was taken in last night.He had a
letter come yesterday, and I took it out to him, and he told me of what
a fine supper they were going to have, saying they had bought some eggs
and a chicken of a boy."suddenly exclaimed the corporal, "that boy to-day walked to
the rear some little distance--made an excuse for going; he might not
have been such a fool as he looked.""Corporal, I will be here a little after dark
with a squad of men to help you keep watch.In the mean time keep a
sharp lookout.""That I will," answered the corporal."Do you think that boy was a
spy?"But if any
trouble occurs on the picket line to-night, it will be at this post."That night Fred doubled the pickets on six posts which he considered the
most exposed.But the extra men were to guard the rear instead of the
front.The most explicit instructions were given, and they were
cautioned that they were to let no alarm at the front make them relax
their vigilance in the rear.Thirty yards in the rear of the post where
he was to watch Fred had noticed a small ravine which led down into a
wood.It was through this ravine that he concluded the enemy would creep
if they should try to gain the rear of the post.Fred posted his men so
as to watch this ravine.To the corporal who had charge of the post, he
said:

"My theory is, that some one comes up to your sentinel, and attracts his
attention by pretending to be a friend, or perhaps a deserter.This, of
course, will necessitate the sentinel's calling for you, and naturally
attract the attention of every man awake.While this is going on, a
party that has gained the rear unobserved will rush on you and be in
your midst before you know it, and you will be taken without a single
gun being fired."said one, "I believe it could be done.""Now," continued Fred, "if you are hailed from the front to-night act
just as if you had not heard of this.When everything was prepared the soldiers, wrapped in their blankets,
sat down to wait for what might come.So intently did they listen that
the falling of a leaf would startle them.There was a half-moon, but dark clouds swept across the sky, and only
now and then she looked forth, hiding her face again in a moment.Once
in a while a dash of cold rain would cause the sentinels to shiver and
sink their chins deeper into the collars of their great coats.Midnight came, and still all was quiet.The soldiers not on guard lay
wrapped in their blankets, some of them in the land of dreams.Off in the woods the hoot of an owl was heard.A few minutes passed, and again the dismal "Whoo!Instantly they were all
attention, and every sense alert.whispered the sergeant, next to him."Nothing but the suspicious hooting of an owl," whispered back Fred.Then to the soldiers, "Perfectly still, men; not a sound."So still were they that the beatings of their hearts could be heard.Again the dismal hoot was heard, this time so near that it startled
them.Then from the sentinel out in front came the short, sharp challenge,
"Who comes there?""A deserter who wishes to come into the
lines and give himself up."The corporal went forward to receive the deserter.Now there came the
sound of swiftly advancing footsteps in front of the rear post, and dim
figures were seen through the darkness.Seven rifles belched forth their contents, and for a moment the flashes
of the guns lighted up the scene, and then all was dark.There were cries of pain, hoarse yells of surprise and anger, and then a
scattering volley returned."Use your revolvers," shouted Fred, and a rapid fire was opened.There were a few more
scattering shots, and all was still.The deserter, who was so anxious to give himself up, the moment the
alarm was given fired at the sentinel and vanished in the darkness.The sound of the firing created the wildest commotion in camp.The long
roll was beaten; the half-dressed, frightened soldiers came rolling out
of their tents, some without their guns, others without their cartridge
boxes; excited officers in their night clothes ran through the camp,
waving their bare swords and shouting: "Fall in, men, for God's sake,
fall in."It was some minutes before the excitement abated, and every one was
asking, "What is it?The officer of the day, with a strong escort, came riding out to where
the firing was heard.Being challenged, he gave the countersign, and
then hurriedly asked what occasioned the firing."Oh," cheerfully responded Fred, "they tried to take us in, and got
taken in themselves."An examination of the ground in front of where Fred's squad was
stationed revealed two Confederates still in death, and trails of blood
showed that others had been wounded."You can go to your quarters," said Fred to his men."You will not be
needed again to-night; and, Lieutenant," said he, turning to the officer
of the day, "each and every one of these men deserves thanks for his
steadiness and bravery.""I hardly think, General," said Fred, the next morning, as he made his
report, "that your pickets will be disturbed any more."As for General Schoepf, he was delighted, and could not thank Fred
enough.For three or four days things were comparatively quiet.Then a small
scouting party was attacked and two men captured.The next day a larger
party was attacked and driven in, with a loss of one killed and three
wounded.The stories were the same; the leader of the Confederates was a
young lieutenant, who showed the utmost bravery and handled his men with
consummate skill."I wish," said General Schoepf to Fred, "that you would teach this
young lieutenant the same kind of a lesson that you taught those fellows
who were capturing our pickets.""I can try, General, but I am afraid the job will not only be harder,
but much more dangerous than that one," answered Fred."This same young lieutenant," continued the general, "may have had a
hand in that picket business, and since he received his lesson there has
turned his attention to scouting parties.""In that case," replied Fred, "it will take the second lesson to teach
him good manners.Well, General, I will give it to him, if I can."The next morning, with eight picked men from Wolford's cavalry, Fred
started out in search of adventure."Don't be alarmed, General," said Fred, as he rode away, "if we do not
come back to-night.Many of their comrades, with longing eyes, looked after them, and wished
they were of the number; yet they did not know but that every one was
riding to death or captivity.Yet such is the love of adventure in the
human breast that the most dangerous undertakings will be gladly risked.After riding west about three miles Fred turned south and went about the
same distance.He then halted, and after a careful survey of the country
ahead, said: "I think, boys, it will be as well for us to leave the road
and take to the woods; we must be getting dangerously near the enemy's
country."The party turned from the road and entered a wood.Working their way
through this, skirting around fields, and dashing across open places,
after making a careful observation of the front, they managed to proceed
about two miles further, when they came near the crossing of two main
roads.Here they stopped and fed their horses, while the men ate their
scanty fare of hard bread and bacon.They had not been there long before a squadron of at least 200
Confederate cavalry came from the south, and turning west were soon out
of sight."I hardly think, boys," said Fred, "it would have paid us to try to take
those fellows into camp; we will let them go this time," and there was a
twinkle in his eye, although he kept his face straight."Just as you say, capt'in," replied one of the troopers, as he took a
chew of tobacco."We would have gobbled them in if you had said the
word."A little while after this a troop of ten horsemen came up the same road,
but instead of turning west they kept on north.At the head of the troop
rode a youthful officer.One of the soldiers with Fred was one of the number that had been
attacked and defeated two days before by the squad of which they were in
search."That's he, that's the fellow!"What he had come for, fate had thrown
in his way."If they were double, we would fight them," cried the men all together."Let them pass out of sight before we pursue," said Fred."The farther
we get them from their lines the better.""Now," said Fred, after they had waited about five minutes.A ride of a
few minutes more brought them into the road.Halting a moment, Fred
turned to his men and said:

"Men, I know every one of you will do your duty.All I have to say is
obey orders, keep cool, and make every shot count.With a cheer they followed their gallant young leader.After riding
about two miles, Fred reined up and said: "They have not dodged us, have
they, boys?We ought to have sighted them before this.Here is where we
turned off of the road.I believe they noticed that a squad
of horsemen had turned off into the woods, and are following the tracks.Let's see," and Fred jumped from his horse, and examined the tracks
leading into the woods."That's what they did, boys," said he, looking up."I will give that
lieutenant credit for having sharp eyes.Now, boys, we will give him a
surprise by following."They did not go more than half a mile before they caught sight of the
Confederates.Evidently they had concluded not to follow the tracks any
farther, for they had turned and were coming back, and the two parties
must have sighted each other at nearly the same moment.There was the sharp crack of a carbine, and a ball whistled over the
Federals' heads.The young lieutenant who led the Confederates was
far too careful a leader to charge an unknown number of men.Instead of
charging the Confederates dismounted, and leaving their horses in charge
of two of their number the rest deployed and advanced, dodging from tree
to tree, and the bullets began to whistle uncomfortably close, one horse
being hit."Dismount, and take the horses back," was Fred's order."We must meet
them with their own game."The two men who were detailed to take the
horses back went away grumbling because they were not allowed to stay in
the fight.Telling them to keep well covered, Fred advanced his men slightly, and
soon the carbines were cracking at a lively rate.But the fight was more noisy than dangerous, every man being careful to
keep a tree between himself and his foe."This can be kept up all day," muttered Fred, "and only trees and
ammunition will suffer.Orders were given to fall back to the horses, and the men obeyed
sullenly.A word from Fred, and their faces brightened.Mounting their
horses, they rode back as if in disorderly retreat.As soon as the Confederates discovered the movement, they rushed back
for their horses, mounted, and with wild hurrahs started in swift
pursuit of what they thought was a demoralized and retreating foe.Coming to favorable ground, Fred ordered his men to wheel and charge.So
sudden was the movement that the Confederates faltered, then halted.cried their young leader, spurring his horse on, but at that
moment a chance shot cut one of his bridle reins.The horse became
unmanageable, and running under the overhanging branches of a tree, the
gallant lieutenant was hurled to the ground.His men, dismayed by his
fall, and unable to withstand the impetuous onslaught of the Federals,
beat a precipitate retreat, leaving their commander and two of their
number prisoners in the hands of their foes.Two more of their men were
grievously wounded.Three of the Federals had been wounded in the mêlée.Fred dismounted and bent over the young lieutenant, and then started
back uttering an exclamation of surprise and grief.He had looked into
the face of his cousin, Calhoun Pennington.Hurriedly Fred placed his
hand on the fallen boy's heart.There was no sign of a
wound on his body.He has only been stunned by the fall," exclaimed Fred.In the mean time the five remaining Confederates had halted about a
quarter of a mile away, and were listening to what a sergeant, now in
command, was saying."Boys," he exclaimed, "it will be to our everlasting shame and disgrace
if we run away and leave the lieutenant in the hands of those cursed
Yankees.Some of them must be disabled, as well as some of us.Let us
charge and retake the lieutenant, or die to a man in the attempt.""Here is our hand on that, Sergeant," said each one of the four, and one
after the other placed his hand in that of the grim old sergeant.But just as they were about to start on their desperate attempt, they
were surprised to see Fred riding towards them, waving a white
handkerchief.When he came in hailing distance, he cried:

"Men, your gallant young leader lies over here grievously hurt.We are
going to withdraw," and wheeling his horse, he rode swiftly back.One of his men was so badly
wounded that he had to be supported on his horse; therefore their
progress was slow, and it was night before they reached camp.Fred made
his report to General Schoepf and turned over his two prisoners.The
general was well pleased, and extended to Fred and the soldiers with him
his warmest congratulations."If you had only brought in that daring young lieutenant with you your
victory would have been complete," said the general."I hardly think, General," said Fred, "that you will be troubled with
him any more.He was still insensible when we left, and with my three
wounded men and the two prisoners it was well-nigh an impossibility for
us to bring him in.""I know," replied the General, "and as you say, I think we have had the
last of him.""I sincerely hope so," was Fred's answer as he turned away, and it meant
more than the general thought.Fred had a horror of meeting his cousin
in conflict, and devoutly prayed he might never do so again.Every time he closed his eyes he could see the pale
face of his cousin lying there in the wood, and the thought that he
might be dangerously hurt, perhaps dead, filled him with terror."Why,"
he asked himself over and over again, "did the fortune of war bring us
together?"Let us return to the scene of the conflict, and see how Calhoun is
getting along.The Confederates received Fred's message with surprise."That lets us out of a mighty tough scrape," remarked the sergeant."We
must have hurt them worse than we thought.""Don't know about that," answered one of his men who was watching the
Federals as they retired."There is only one of them who appears to be
badly hurt; and they have poor Moon and Hunt in limbo, sure.""Better be prisoners than dead," answered the sergeant."But, boys, let
us to the lieutenant.It's strange the Yanks didn't try to take him
back."When they reached Calhoun, he was already showing signs of returning
consciousness, and in a few minutes he was able to sit up and converse."Then we whipped them after all," and his face lighted up with joy."Can't say that we did, Lieutenant," answered the sergeant; "but they
left mighty sudden for some reason."Calhoun looked around on his men with a troubled countenance."I see
only five of you," he said; "where are the rest?""Two are back nursing wounds," answered the sergeant."Sheldon is hit,
so hard hit I am afraid he is done for.As for Moon and Hunt, they have
gone off with the Yanks."The tears rolled down the cheeks of the young officer."Boys," he said,
chokingly, "I believe I have lost my grip.There was that last picket
affair that went against us, and now we are all broken up in a fair
combat.""Don't take on, Lieutenant," said the sergeant, soothingly."It was that
chance bullet that cut your bridle rein that did the business.If it
hadn't been for that we would have wiped them out, sure.As it is, we
are thankful they didn't take a notion to lug you off.""No, they didn't," replied the sergeant, and then he told Calhoun what
had happened."What kind of a looking man was the leader of the Yanks?""He was a boy, no older than yourself.He was mounted on a magnificent
bay horse with a star in the forehead."I see it all," sighed Calhoun."The leader of that party was my cousin,
Fred Shackelford.Boys, help me on my
horse.I am badly shaken up, but not seriously hurt.We will square
accounts with those fellows one of these days."And the little party, bearing their wounded, sadly wended their way back
to the Confederate camp.For the next few days the weather was so bad and the roads in such a
terrible condition that both armies were comparatively quiet.Nothing as
yet had been heard from the advance of General Thomas, and General
Schoepf began to be very uneasy.At last Fred offered to ride toward
Columbia, and see if he could not get some tidings of the missing
column.The offer was gladly accepted, and Fred set out.He met with no
adventure until about fifteen miles from Somerset, when he suddenly came
face to face with a young soldier, and he supposed a Federal, as he wore
a blue great coat.But a second look caused a cry of surprise to burst
from Fred's lips, and at the same time the supposed Federal soldier
snatched a revolver from the holster.The cousins were once more face to
face."Put up your revolver, Calhoun," cried Fred."Is that the way you greet
your cousin?"For a moment Calhoun gazed on Fred in silence, then raising his hand in
courtly salute, he suddenly turned his horse, and jumping him over a low
fence, disappeared in a copse of wood.Fred was on the point of raising his voice to call him back, when it
flashed upon him that Calhoun had been playing the spy, and that he dare
not stop, even for a moment."He was only stunned after all, when he was hurled from his horse,"
thought Fred."I am so glad; a heavy load has been lifted from my mind.It would have been extremely awkward for
me to have found out he was a spy, and then let him go."It was with a lighter heart that he pursued his journey, but he had gone
but a short distance when he met a courier from General Thomas with
dispatches for General Schoepf.He was informed that the advance of
General Thomas was but a short distance in the rear.A few moments more
and Fred was in the presence of his general.said Thomas, "I am glad to see you."All right, General, only General Schoepf has been sorely worried over
your non-appearance."The march has been an awful one, and has taken three
times as long as I expected.But we will be at Logan's Cross Roads
to-night, where I shall halt to concentrate my army.If the enemy does
not retreat, we may look for a lively time in about three days.""The lively time, General, may come before three days," answered Fred,
significantly."The Rebels may conclude," answered Fred, "to attack you before you can
bring up the rest of your force, or get aid from Somerset.Fishing Creek
is very high; I had to swim it.It will be almost impossible to get
infantry or artillery over.""I have thought of that," replied the general, smiling."I shall try and
be ready for them if they come."Fred was right in his surmise that Calhoun had been acting the part of a
spy.He had been playing a very dangerous game, and had been successful.Disguised as a country boy, he had boldly entered Columbia, and in a
great measure had fathomed the plans of General Thomas.It was a matter
of common report that as soon as the army could be concentrated, General
Zollicoffer would be attacked.Calhoun had made a careful estimate of
the strength of Thomas' army, and when met by Fred he was taking an
observation of his order of march, and how long it would take the rear
brigade to reinforce the advance brigade, if it should be attacked.The sudden meeting with Fred was a surprise to him.But when he heard
Fred's voice he knew his life was in no danger; yet he dare not tarry,
even for a moment, and so escaped as we have seen.No sooner was he out of sight of Fred than he checked his horse."That
was a lucky escape," he said to himself."If I had to meet any one, it
was fortunate I met Fred.I would so much like to have a talk with him, but it would have been
madness to have stopped, and then it would have placed him in a very
awkward predicament.Selim, old boy," continued he, patting his horse's
neck, "we have work yet before us; we must see where General Thomas
camps."It was early on the morning of January 18th that Calhoun rode into the
Confederate camp at Beech Grove.Without changing his mud-bespattered
garments, he at once sought the quarters of Major-General G. B.
Crittenden, who had been placed in chief command of the army."Ah, Lieutenant," exclaimed the general, "I am glad to see you.I have
been thinking of you, and blaming myself for permitting you to go on
your hazardous adventure.He who acts as a spy takes his life in his
hands.""It is an old saying that 'all is well that ends well,'" Calhoun
answered, smiling."You ought to have seen what a splendid country
bumpkin I made; and I have succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations.I have very important news for you, General.General
Thomas is now encamped at Logan's Cross Roads, only ten miles away.He
will wait there for his rear brigade, and also for reinforcements from
Somerset.He has only one brigade with him, numbering not much over
4,000 men."Calhoun then went on and gave General Crittenden the full details of the
strength of the Federal army, saying that he thought the rear brigade
of Thomas' army could not reach Logan's Cross Roads for at least two
days, and that owing to the height of water in Fishing Creek he believed
it impossible for Thomas to receive reinforcements from Somerset."If these forces all combine, General," continued Calhoun, "they will so
far outnumber us that it would be madness to risk a battle.To-morrow
Thomas will be isolated; his force is inferior to yours."You think that your information as to numbers and position is
absolutely correct, do you?""I do, General," answered Calhoun."If you attack General Thomas in the
morning I am confident you will attack with a superior force.""It is either that or a disastrous retreat," said the general, gravely."I will call a council of my officers at once."As soon as I can get off some of this mud I will be ready," answered
Calhoun.The council was called, and General Crittenden laid the facts before his
officers.Calhoun was asked a great many questions, to all of which he
gave full and sufficient answers.The council, without a dissenting
voice, voted to attack Thomas the next morning.It was nearly midnight when the Confederates marched out of their
entrenchments, General Zollicoffer's brigade having the advance.Calhoun acted as aid on the staff of General Crittenden.The distance,
ten miles, made a fearful night march, considering the roads.Calhoun
afterwards said that it was one of the worst marches he ever made.A cold drizzling rain fell that chilled the
soldiers to the very bone.Through the rain and the mud for hour after
hour the brave men of the Confederacy toiled on, animated by the hope
that they would soon meet and hurl back in inglorious defeat the men
whom they considered ruthless invaders of their soil.It took nearly
seven hours to march that ten miles, every step being taken through mud
and water, sometimes nearly knee deep.Just as the gray shadows in the east betokened the ushering in of the
short January day, the crack!of guns in front told that the
Federal pickets had been alarmed.The sharp reports of those guns as
they echoed back along the mud-stained ranks caused the weary soldier to
forget his weariness.The cold was no longer felt, the excitement of the
coming battle sent the blood tingling through the veins.It is time to turn now to General Thomas and his little army that lay
encamped at Logan's Cross Roads in the darkness and shadows of that
gloomy night.Couriers had been sent back to hurry up the rear brigade;
orders had been sent to General Schoepf to at once forward three
regiments, but General Thomas well knew if he was attacked in the
morning none of these reinforcements would reach him.The general sat in his tent, listening to Fred giving an account of what
had happened at Somerset during the three weeks he had been there.He
was especially interested in the account Fred gave of his picket fight."That, Shackelford," said the general, "was strategy worthy of a much
older head.Your little fight was also admirably managed.""I had rather it had been against any one than my cousin," answered
Fred."Such things cannot be avoided," answered Thomas, with a sigh.I am a Virginian, and must fight against those who are
near and dear to me."Fred did not answer; he was thinking of his father.The general sat as if buried in deep thought for a moment, and then
suddenly looking up, said:

"Shackelford, you know when we were going into camp this evening that
you said you feared an attack in the morning.""I am almost positive of it, General," was Fred's reply."Because the enemy is well posted and must know that you mean to attack
them when your forces are consolidated, and your army will be so strong
they cannot hope to stand before it.I am also of the opinion that they
are well informed of your isolated position here; that one of your
brigades is two days' march in the rear, also that owing to the high
stage of water in Fishing Creek it will be impossible for General
Schoepf to reinforce you for a day or two.I also believe that the enemy
has a fair estimate of your exact strength."During this speech of Fred's the general listened intently, and then
said: "You have a better idea of my actual position than I trust most of
my officers have, but you said some things which need explaining.On
what grounds do you base your belief that the enemy are so well
acquainted with my situation and strength?""No positive proof, General, but an intuition which I cannot explain.But this impression is also based on more solid ground than intuition.Yesterday, just before I met your advance, I met a man in our uniform.When he saw me he jumped his horse over a fence and disappeared in a
wood.To-day I caught a glimpse of
that same man in the woods yonder on our right."Thomas mused a moment, and then said: "If the Confederate general fully
knows our situation and strength, he is foolish if he does not attack
me.But if he does, I shall try and be ready for him."The general then once more carefully examined his maps of the country,
gave orders that a very strong picket should be posted, and that well in
advance of the infantry pickets cavalry videttes should be placed, and
that the utmost vigilance should be exercised.Then turning to Fred, he said: "If your expectations are realized in the
morning, you may act as one of my aids.And now, gentlemen," said he,
turning to his staff, "for some sleep; we must be astir early in the
morning."In the gray light of the early morning, from away out in front, there
came the faint report of rifles.Early as it was, General Thomas and staff had had their breakfast, and
every soldier was prepared.General Manson, in command of the advance regiments, came galloping back
to headquarters."General," he said, "we are attacked in force.""Go back," replied General Thomas, without betraying any more excitement
than if he were ordering his men out on review, "form your men in the
most advantageous position, and hold the enemy until I can bring up the
rest of the troops."In a trice aids were galloping in every direction.The fitful reports of guns in front had become a steady roll of
musketry.The loud mouth of the cannon joined in, and the heavy
reverberations rolled over field and through forest.In an incredibly
short time every regiment was in motion towards where the heavy smoke of
battle was already hanging over the field.Of all the thousands, the general commanding seemed the most
unconcerned.He leisurely mounted his horse and trotted toward the
conflict.His eye swept the field, and as the regiments came up they
were placed just where they were needed.His manner inspired every one
who saw him with confidence.To Fred the scene was inexpressibly grand.The
wild cheering of men, the steady roll of musketry, the deep bass of
cannon, thrilled him with an excitement never felt before.The singing
of the balls made strange music in his ears.Now and then a shell or
solid shot would crash through the forest and shatter the trees as with
a thunderbolt.Soon a thin line of men came staggering back, some
holding up an arm streaming with blood, others hobbling along using
their guns as crutches.A few, wild with fear, had thrown away their
guns, and were rushing back, lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but an insane desire to get out of that hell of fire.At first there was a lump in the throat, as if
the heart was trying to get away, a slight trembling of the limbs, a
momentary desire to get out of danger, and then he was as cool and
collected as if on parade.Through the storm of balls he rode,
delivering his orders with a smiling face, and a word of cheer.General
Thomas noticed the coolness of his aid, and congratulated him on his
soldierly qualities.On the left, in front of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, the battle was
being waged with obstinate fury.Colonel Fry, seeing Fred, rode up to
him, and said: "Tell General Thomas I must have reinforcements at once;
the enemy is flanking me.""Say to Colonel Fry," said Thomas, "that I will at once forward the aid
required.Until the reinforcements come, tell him to hold his position
at all hazards."Fry compressed his lips, glanced along his
line, saw the point of greatest danger, and quickly ordered two of his
left companies to the right, leading them in person, Fred going with
him.An officer enveloped in a large gray coat suddenly rode out of the wood,
and galloping up to them shouted: "For God's sake, stop firing!You are
firing on your own men."Just then two other officers rode up to the one in a gray cloak.Seeing
Colonel Fry and Fred, they at once fired on them.Colonel Fry was
slightly wounded, but Fred was untouched.As quick as thought both
returned the fire.The officer at whom Fred fired reeled in his saddle,
then straightened up and galloped to the rear.Colonel Fry fired at the
officer in the gray cloak.He threw up his arms, and then plunged
headlong to the ground.The bullet from Colonel Fry's pistol had pierced the heart of General
Zollicoffer.The battle now raged along the entire line with great fury.The lowering
clouds grew darker, and the pitiless rain, cold and icy, fell on the
upturned faces of the dead.The cruel storm beat upon the wounded, and
they shivered and moaned as their life's blood ebbed away.The smoke
settled down over the field and hid the combatants from view, but
through the gloom the flashes of the guns shone like fitful tongues of
flame.Then the Federal line began to press forward, and soon the whole
Confederate army was in full retreat.[Illustration: The Battle now raged along the entire line with great
fury.]It was at this time that Fred's attention was attracted to a young
Confederate officer, who was trying to rally his men.Bravely did he
strive to stay the panic, but suddenly Fred saw him falter, sway to and
fro, and then fall.Once more did the Confederates try to rally under
the leadership of a young mounted officer, but they were swept aside,
and the battle was over.Fred's first thought was for the young Confederate officer whom he saw
fall while trying to rally his men.There was something about him that
seemed familiar.Fred's heart stood still at the
thought.He was lying on his
side, his head resting on his left arm, his right hand still grasping
his sword, a smile on his face.As Fred looked on the placid face of the
dead, a groan burst from him, and the tears gushed from his eyes.With
his handkerchief he wiped away the grime of battle, and there, in all
his manly beauty, Bailie Peyton lay before him.Fred's thoughts flew
back to that day at Gallatin.No more would those eloquent lips hold
entranced a spellbound audience.No more would his fiery words stir the
hearts of his countrymen, even as the wind stirs the leaves of the
forest.Tenderly did Fred have him carried back and laid by the side of his
fallen chieftain.As soon as
possible the remains of both were forwarded through the lines to
Nashville.It was not the city that Fred saw in August.Then it was wild and
hilarious with joy, carried away with the pomp and glory of war.Zollicoffer was the idol of the people of Tennessee; Bailie Peyton of
its young men.That both should fall in the same battle plunged
Nashville in deepest mourning.When the bodies arrived, it was a city of tears.Flags floated at
half-mast; women walked the streets wringing their hands and weeping
bitter tears.She was to drink
still deeper of the bitter cup of war.Back over the ten miles that they had marched through the darkness and
rain, the Confederate army fled in the wildest confusion.Swift in
pursuit came the victorious army of Thomas.Before night his cannon were
shelling the entrenchments at Beech Grove.There was no rest for the
hungry, weary, despondent Confederates.In the darkness of the night
they stole across the river, and then fled, a demoralized mob, leaving
everything but themselves in the hands of the victors.The next morning an officer came to Fred and said one of the prisoners
would like to see him."One of the prisoners would like to see me," asked Fred, in surprise."I don't know," answered the officer."But he is a plucky chap; it's the
young lieutenant who headed the last rally of the Rebs.He fought until
he was entirely deserted by his men and surrounded by us; he then tried
to cut his way out, but his horse was shot and he captured.""It must be Calhoun," and he rushed to
where the prisoners were confined.And the boys were in each other's arms."Cal, you don't know how glad I am to see you," exclaimed Fred.answered Calhoun, with a dash of his old spirits."No," said Fred; "like St.Paul, I will say 'except these bonds.'But
Calhoun, I must have a good long talk with you in private.""Not much privacy here, Fred," said Calhoun, looking around at the crowd
that was staring at them.Fred went to General Thomas and told him that his cousin was among the
prisoners, and asked permission to take him to his quarters.The
permission was readily given, and the boys had the day and night to
themselves.How they did talk, and how much they had to tell each other!First Fred
had to tell Calhoun all about himself.When he had finished Calhoun grasped his hand and exclaimed: "Fred, I am
proud of you, if you are fighting with the Yanks.How I would like to
ride by your side!But of all your adventures, the one with poor Robert
Ferror touches me deepest.He must
have had a great deal of pure gold about him, notwithstanding his
cowardly crime.""He did," sighed Fred, "he did; and yet I can never think of the
assassination of Captain Bascom without a shudder.On the other hand, I
can never think of Ferror's death without tears.As I think of him now,
I am of the opinion that the indignities heaped upon him had, in a
measure, unbalanced his mind, and that the killing of Bascom was the act
of an insane person.But, Cal, I hate to talk about it; that night of
horrors always gives me the shivers."There is not much to tell," answered Calhoun."You know I left Danville
with your father for Bowling Green.Owing to the influence of my father,
I was commissioned a second lieutenant and given a place on the staff of
Governor Johnson.You know a provisional State government was organized
at Bowling Green, and G. M. Johnson appointed Governor.When General
Buckner tried to capture Louisville by surprise, and you objected by
throwing the train off the track, I was one of the victims of the
outrage.I recognized you, just as your father ordered the volley
fired."did he order that volley fired at
me?""Yes; but he did not know it was you when he gave the order.When I
called out it was you, he nearly fainted, and would have fallen if one
of his officers had not caught him.He wanted to resign then and there,
but General Buckner would not hear of it.Really, Fred, I think he would
have ordered that volley even if he had known you; but if you had been
killed, he would have killed himself afterward.""He loves me even if he has disowned me.""Well," continued Calhoun, "to make a long story short, I became
prodigiously jealous of you.You were covering yourself with glory while
I was sitting around doing nothing.As Zollicoffer appeared to be the only one of the Confederate generals
who was at all active, I asked and received permission to join him,
where I was given a roving commission as a scout.If I do say it, I made
it rather lively for you fellows.At length I hit upon a nice little
plan of capturing your pickets, and was quite successful until you found
it out and put an end to my fun.""Calhoun," exclaimed Fred, in surprise, "was it you with whom I had that
night fight?""It was, and you came near making an end of your hopeful cousin, I can
tell you.Out of seven men, I had two killed and four wounded.Only one
man and myself escaped unhurt, and I had three bullet holes through my
clothes.That put an end to my raids upon your pickets, and I confined
myself to scouting once more.Then came that unlucky fight with you in
the woods.Fred, I must congratulate you on the way you managed that.Your retreat showed me your exact strength, and I thought I could wipe
you off the face of the earth.Your sudden wheel and charge took us
completely by surprise, and disconcerted my men.That shot which cut my
bridle rein took me out of the fight, and perhaps it was just as well
for me that it did.When I came to and found out what had been done, I
at once knew you must have been in command of the squad, and if I could
I would have hugged you for your generosity.""Cal," replied Fred, his voice trembling with emotion, "you can hardly
realize my feelings when I saw you lying pale and senseless there before
me; it took all the fight out of me.""I know, I know," answered Calhoun, laying his hand caressingly on
Fred's shoulder."I was badly shaken up by that fall, but not seriously
hurt.Now, comes the most dangerous of my adventures.When I met you in
the road, I----"

"Stop!"broke in Fred, "not another word.Of course you were on one of
your scouting expeditions."A curious look came over Calhoun's face, and then he said, in a low
voice: "You are right, Fred; I was on one of my scouting expeditions,"
and he shuddered slightly."Fred," suddenly asked Calhoun, "is there any possible way for me to
keep from going to prison?""Sometimes prisoners give their parole," answered Fred."I will see what
can be done."The next morning General Thomas sent for Fred, and said that he was
about to send some dispatches to General Buell at Louisville."And,"
continued he, "owing to your splendid conduct and the value of the
services you have rendered, I have selected you as the messenger.Then,
in all probability, it will be very quiet in my front for some time,
and General Nelson may have more active work for you.You know," he
concluded with a smile, "I only have the loan of you."Fred heartily thanked the general for the honor bestowed, and then said:
"General, I have a great boon to ask.""You know my cousin is here a prisoner.He is more like a brother than a
cousin--the only brother I ever knew.The boon I ask is that you grant
him a parole."Calhoun was sent for, and soon stood in the presence of the general."An officer, I see," said the general, as he glanced Calhoun over."Yes, sir; Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Governor Johnson's staff,"
answered Calhoun, with dignity."What were you doing up here if you are one of Johnson's staff?""Lieutenant, your cousin has asked as a special favor that you be
granted a parole.He says that you reside in Danville, and as he is
going to Louisville, he would like to have you accompany him as far as
your home.""General," answered Calhoun, "you would place me under a thousand
obligations if you would grant me a parole; but only on one condition,
and that is that you effect my exchange as quickly as possible.""I see," said he, "that you and Shackelford are
alike; never satisfied unless you are in the thickest of the fray.The parole was made out, and Fred and Calhoun made preparations to start
for Danville.Never did two boys enjoy a ride more than they did.In spite of bad roads and bad weather, the exuberance of their spirits
knew no bounds.They were playmates again, without a word of difference
between them.As far as they were concerned, the clouds of war had
lifted, and they basked in the sunlight of peace."I say, Fred," remarked Calhoun, "this is something like it; seems like
old times.Why did this war have to come and separate us?""The war, Calhoun," he answered, "has laid a heavier hand
on me than on you, for it has made me an outcast from home.""Don't worry, Fred; it will come out all right," answered Calhoun,
cheerily.On the morning of the second day the boys met with an adventure for
which they were not looking.Even as early in the war as this, those
roving bands of guerrillas which afterward proved such a curse to the
border States began to appear.It was somewhat of a surprise to the boys
when four men suddenly rode out of the woods by the side of the road,
and roughly demanded that they give an account of themselves."By my authority," answered the leader, with a fearful oath."And your authority I refuse to acknowledge," was the hot answer."See here, young man, you had better keep a civil tongue in your head,"
and as the leader said this he significantly tapped the butt of his
revolver."I wish to know who you are, and where you are going, and that ----
quick.""That is easily answered," replied Calhoun."As you see by my uniform, I
am a Confederate officer.I am on parole, and am on my way to my home in
Danville, there to wait until I am regularly exchanged.""And I suppose your companion is also
in the Confederate service.""Not at all," replied Fred, quietly."I am in the service of the United
States.""I think both of you are
Lincolnites.We will have to search you, and I think in the end shoot
you both.""Here is my parole," said Calhoun, his face growing red with anger.The man took it, glanced it over, and then coolly tore it in two, and
flung it down."Any one can carry such a paper as that.We
want them horses, and we want you.Boys, it will be fun to try our
marksmanship on these youngsters, won't it?"and he turned to his
companions with a brutal laugh.But the guerrillas made a great mistake; they thought they were only
dealing with two boys, and were consequently careless and off their
guard.With a sharp, quick look at Calhoun which meant volumes, Fred quickly
drew his revolver.There was a flash, a report, and the leader of the
guerrillas dropped from his horse.With a startled oath, the others drew
their revolvers, but before they could raise them there were two reports
so close together as almost to sound as one, and two more of the gang
rolled from their horses.The remaining one threw up his hands and began
to beg for mercy.[Illustration: Fred drew his Revolver, and the Guerrilla dropped from
his horse.]"You miscreant you," exclaimed Calhoun, covering him with his revolver."I ought to send a ball through your cowardly carcass, to be even with
my cousin here; for he got two of you, while I only got one.""You have; then so much the worse for the wife and children.""I am not fit to die," he blubbered."That is plain to be seen," answered Calhoun."Now hand me your weapons--butts first, remember.""Now pick up that parole your leader tore and threw down, and hand it to
me."Calhoun sat eyeing him a moment, and then continued: "I ought to shoot
you without mercy, but I believe in giving a dog a chance for his life,
and so I will give you a chance.You mount your horse, and when I say
'Go,' you go.After I say 'Go' I shall count five, and then shoot.If I
miss you, which I don't think I shall, I shall continue shooting as long
as you are in range; so the faster you go, the better for you.The man looked appealingly at Calhoun, but seeing no mercy, mounted his
horse as quick as his trembling limbs would let him.His face was white
with fear, and his teeth fairly rattled they chattered so.Calhoun reined his horse around so he was by the fellow's side.The man gave a yell of terror, bent low over his horse's neck and was
off like a shot.Calhoun with a chuckle fired over him, and the fellow
seemed to fairly flatten out.Four times did Calhoun fire, and at each
report the flying horseman appeared to go the faster.As for Fred, he was convulsed with merriment, notwithstanding the
grewsome surroundings."Leave these carrion where they are," said Calhoun in response to a
question from Fred as to what disposition they should make of the dead."That live companion of theirs will be back when we are gone."They rode along in silence for a while, and then Calhoun suddenly said:
"Fred, how I wish I could always fight by your side.It's a pity we have
to fight on different sides.""Just what I was thinking of, Cal," answered Fred; "but we have the
satisfaction of knowing we have fought one battle together.""And won it, too," shouted Calhoun.They reached Danville in due time and without further adventure.To say
that Judge Pennington was surprised to see them riding up together would
be to express it mildly; he was astounded.Then he had his arms around
his boy, and was sobbing, "My son!"And Fred, too," said the judge, at last turning from welcoming his son."I am truly glad to see you, my boy.But how in the world did you two
happen to come together?"And so the whole story had to be told, and the judge listened and
wondered and mourned over the defeat of the Confederates at Mill
Springs."My boy," said the judge, with tears glistening in his eyes, "at least I
am glad to know that you did your duty.""If all the Confederates had
been like Calhoun, we might not have won the victory.""Unless all the Federals had been like you," responded Calhoun
gallantly.The judge would have both boys tell him the full particulars of their
adventures, and listened to their recital with all the pleasure of a
schoolboy.But when they were through, he shook his head sadly, and
said: "Boys, you can't keep that pace up.But I
am proud of you, proud of you both, if Fred is fighting for that
horrible Lincoln."It was a happy day Fred spent at his uncle's.If bitterness was felt towards him it was not shown.When it was noised about that both Calhoun and Fred had returned, they
were besieged with callers.The story of the battle of Mill Springs had
to be told again and again.Colonel Fry was one of the influential
citizens of the city, and especially were they eager to hear the
particulars of his killing General Zollicoffer.Fred concluded to ride his horse to Louisville, instead of riding to
Nicholasville or Lebanon and taking the cars from one of those places."I must have Prince wherever I go after this," he said.asked General Nelson, as Fred rode up to
his headquarters after a very prosaic journey of three days."It is no one else, General," laughed Fred, as he dismounted."Here I
am, here is my good horse, Prince, and here is a letter to you from
General Thomas."Nelson took the letter, read it, and looking up smiling, said: "I see
you still keep up your habit of doing something unusual.Thomas speaks
in the highest terms of your work.the first real victory we have
gained."Yes, General; I have voluminous dispatches for General Buell.I was so
eager to see you I stopped before delivering them.""Ah, my boy, I believe you do think something of bluff old Nelson after
all, even if he has a devil of a temper," and the general kindly patted
the boy on the head."You know, General," he said, brokenly,
"that you took me in, when my father cast me out.""For the good of the country, my boy, for the good of the country," said
the general brusquely."But, come, Fred, I will ride over to General
Buell's headquarters with you.I would like to see General Thomas' full
report of the battle."They found General Buell in the highest of spirits, and Fred was given a
warm welcome.He looked over General Thomas' report, and his whole face
beamed with satisfaction.He asked Fred a multitude of questions, and
was surprised at the knowledge of military affairs which he showed in
his answers."I think, General," said General Buell, turning to Nelson, after he had
dismissed Fred, "that you have not overestimated the abilities of your
protégé.In a private note General Thomas speaks in the highest terms of
him."Somehow I have taken wonderfully to
the boy."What it was General Buell was to do for Fred, that individual was in
ignorance.While in Louisville many of Fred's leisure moments were spent at the
hospitable home of the Vaughns.Mabel's betrothed was now at the front,
and it was astonishing how much note paper that young lady used in
writing to him."You don't write that often to your brother," said Fred, smiling.asked Mabel, looking up in surprise."Yes, your humble servant; didn't you adopt me as a brother?"she replied, "one doesn't have to write
so often to a brother.Lovers are like babies; they have to be petted.But to change the subject, where does my knight-errant expect to go for
his next adventure?""Things appear to be rather quiet just
now."But events were even then transpiring that were to take Fred to a
different theater of action.Commodore Foote and General U. S. Grant sat conversing in the
headquarters of the latter at Cairo, Illinois.The general was puffing a
cigar, and answered in monosyllables between puffs."You have heard nothing yet, have you, General," the commodore was
asking, "of that request we united in sending to General Halleck?"There was silence for some time, the general apparently in deep thought.The commodore broke the silence by asking:

"You went to see him personally once on this matter, did you not?""He ungraciously gave me permission to visit St.Louis in order to see
him, after I had begged for the privilege at least half a dozen times,"
Grant answered."And you laid the matter before him in all its bearings?"asked the commodore, starting in surprise."I mean," said he, "that he struck me metaphorically.I
don't believe he would have hurt me as badly, if he had really struck
me.I was never so cut in all my life.I came away feeling that I had
committed an unpardonable sin from a military standpoint.""Then he would not hear to the proposition at all?"I came away resolving never to ask
another favor of him.Yet so anxious am I to make this campaign that, as
you know, I swallowed my pride and united with you in making the request
that we be allowed to make the movement.""It is strange," replied the commodore, "that he should ignore both our
requests, not favoring us even with a reply.Yet it seems that he must
see that Fort Henry should be reduced at once.If we delay, both the
Cumberland and the Tennessee will be so strongly fortified that it will
be almost impossible to force a passage.Everything is to be gained by
moving at once."Even a civilian ought to see that," replied Grant, as he slowly blew a
cloud of smoke from his mouth, and watched it as it lazily curled
upward."The truth of it is," Grant continued slowly, as if weighing every word,
"too many of us are afraid that another general may win more honor than
we.Now, here are
Buell and myself; each with a separate command, yet both working for the
same object.I should either be subject to the command of Buell, or he
should be subject to my orders.We are now like two men trying to lift
the same burden, and instead of lifting together, one will lift and then
the other.Such a system can but prolong the war indefinitely.""General," said the commodore, earnestly, "I sincerely wish you had the
supreme command here in the West.I believe we would see different
results, and that very soon."Grant blushed like a schoolgirl, fidgeted in his seat, and then said:
"Commodore, you do me altogether too much honor.But this I will say, if
I had supreme command I should not sit still and see the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers fortified without raising a hand to prevent it.Neither do I believe in letting month after month go by for the purpose
of drilling and organizing.The Government seems to forget that time
gives the enemy the same privilege.What is wanted is hard blows, and
these blows should be delivered as soon as possible.Sherman was right
when he asked for 200,000 men to march to the Gulf, yet he was sneered
at by the War Department, hounded by every paper in the land, called
insane, and now he is occupying a subordinate position.The war could be
ended in a year.No one now can tell how long it will last."Just then a telegram was placed in Grant's hands.He read it, and his
whole face lighted up with pleasure."You look pleased," said the commodore."The telegram must bring good
news."Without a word Grant placed the telegram in the hands of the commodore.It was an order from General Halleck to move up the Tennessee as soon as
possible and capture Fort Henry."At last," said the commodore, his face showing as much pleasure as did
Grant's."At last," responded Grant; and then, quickly, "Commodore, we may have
done an injustice to General Halleck.There may be good reasons we know
not of why this order should not have been made before.Commodore, be
ready to move with your fleet to-morrow.""General, I shall be ready; and now good-bye, for both of us have much
before us.But before I go, let me congratulate you.I believe that
success and great honor await you," and with these words the commodore
withdrew.The next day, with 15,000 men, General Grant was steaming up the
Tennessee.General Buell sat in his headquarters at Louisville.General Nelson,
accompanied by Fred, had dropped in to see his general, and at the same
time to give vent to some of his pent-up feelings.he fumed, "for us to sit here and let the
Rebels fortify Bowling Green and Dover and Columbus, and build forts to
blockade the Tennessee, and we not raise a finger to prevent it."Buell smiled at his irate general, and asked: "And what would you do,
Nelson?"I would give
them precious little time to build forts."Before General Buell could answer, an orderly entered with a telegram.He read it, and turning to Nelson, said:

"Well, General, you can cease your fuming.This telegram is from General
Halleck.He tells me he has ordered General Grant up the Tennessee to
reduce Fort Henry, and he wants me to co-operate as much as possible in
the movement."Nelson was on his feet in an instant."General," he exclaimed, "I have a favor, a great favor to ask of you."Buell smilingly answered: "I think I know what it is without your
asking."I do not see how I can spare so many men; you know we have Johnston at
Bowling Green to look after.""But General," answered Nelson, "the Tennessee and Cumberland must be
defended.In all probability the most of Johnston's army will be
transferred there.""In that case, General," answered Buell, "I will remember you.Your
division shall be the first one sent.""Thank you, General, thank you," replied Nelson."I only wish I knew I
was going.""As it is now," continued Buell, "I shall order General Crittenden to
send Cruft's brigade.That brigade is near the mouth of Green river.There is no force of the enemy, in any number, before them, and the
brigade can well be spared.I shall send no more men unless it is
absolutely necessary.I shall at once dispatch an officer to General
Crittenden with necessary orders.""General," now spoke up Fred, "like General Nelson, I have a request to
make, and by your kindness I hope to meet with better success."said Buell, "you wish to carry the orders.If Nelson has no
objection, I think I can grant that request.The general has told me
something of your history, Mr.General Thomas also speaks
in the highest terms of you.""You can go if you wish, Fred," answered Nelson."I only hope I shall
soon be with you."So it was settled, and before night Fred and his good horse Prince were
on their way down the Ohio.Fred not only carried dispatches to General
Crittenden, but he had personal letters both from General Buell and
General Nelson to General Cruft commending him to the latter officer.Disembarking at Owensboro, Fred made a swift ride to Calhoun, the
headquarters of General Crittenden.He delivered his dispatches to the
general, and at once sought the headquarters of General Cruft.The
general read Fred's letters, and then said: "You are very welcome, Mr.Shackelford; you may consider yourself as one of my staff until such
time as General Nelson may join us."Soon orders came to General Cruft to at once prepare to join Grant.It was nearly noon on February the 14th when the fleet on which General
Cruft's brigade had embarked arrived at Fort Donelson.The place had
already been invested two days, and some severe fighting had taken
place.The weather, from being warm and rainy, had suddenly turned cold
on the afternoon of the 13th, and Fred shivered as he emerged from the
comfortable cabin of the steamboat and stepped out on the cold, desolate
bank of the river.The ground was covered with ice and snow, and the
scene was dreary in the extreme.Now and then the heavy reverberation of a cannon came rolling down the
river, and echoed and re-echoed among the hills.A fleet of gunboats lay
anchored in the river, the mouths of their great guns looking out over
the dark sullen water as though watching for their prey.General Cruft's
brigade was assigned to the division of General Lew Wallace, which
occupied the center of the Federal army.Back in the rear little groups
of soldiers stood shivering around small fires, trying to warm their
benumbed limbs, or to cook their scanty rations.The condition of the soldiers was pitiable in the extreme.There were
no tents; but few had overcoats, and many on the hard, muddy march from
Fort Henry had even thrown away their blankets.In the front lines no
fires could be lighted, and there the soldiers stood, exposed to the
furious storm of sleet and snow, hungry, benumbed, hardly knowing
whether they were dead or alive.Such were the heroes who stood for
three days before Donelson.As Fred looked on all this suffering, he wondered at the fortitude with
which it was endured.There were few complaints from the soldiers; they
were even cheerful and eager to meet the foe.About three o'clock the gunboats came steaming up the river and engaged
the Confederate batteries.It was a most sublime spectacle, and held Fred spellbound.The very
heavens seemed splitting, and the earth shook and trembled from the
heavy concussions.Nearer and nearer the gunboats came to the batteries
until it seemed to Fred the great guns were vomiting fire and smoke into
each other's throats.During the fight Fred noticed a small, thickset man sitting on his horse
intently watching the fight.His countenance was perfectly impassive,
and one could not tell by watching him whether he sympathized with
friend or foe.The boilers of the Essex had been
blown up, the other boats were bruised and battered and torn by the
great shots which had struck them, and were helplessly drifting down
the stream.From the Federal side there
went up a great groan of disappointment, while from the Confederate
lines there arose the wild cheers of victory.The silent man on horseback turned and rode away.Not a sign, not a word
that he was disappointed.asked Fred of an officer standing by him."That, young man," was the answer, "is General Grant.He must be awfully
cut up, but he does not show it."Fred turned and looked after Grant as he rode slowly away."There,"
thought Fred, "is a man who is going to make his mark in this war.In
some of his actions he reminds me of General Thomas.On the frozen ground, without tents or fire,
the soldiers once more made their beds.The wind sighed and moaned
through the bare branches, as if weeping at the suffering it caused.Many, to keep from freezing, never lay down, but kept up a weary march,
so that the blood might circulate.A council of war was
held, and it was resolved that in the morning they would cut their way
through the lines of steel which Grant had thrown around them.All
preparations were made, every order given, and then they waited for the
light of morning--the last morning that hundreds would ever see.It was hardly light when Fred was awakened by the fitful sound of
musketry over on the right.In front of Wallace's division only the
report of a rifle of a picket was heard now and then.Hurriedly eating a
little breakfast, he mounted his horse and reported to General Cruft for
duty.The men were all standing at arms, but there was nothing for them
to do.But over on the right the rattle of musketry grew more intense,
the roll of heavy volleys began to be heard, and then the deep-voiced
cannon joined in the chorus.Louder and louder grew the din of the
conflict.The smoke of battle began to ascend above the treetops like
smoke from a burning coal-pit.The sound of battle came nearer, the roll
of musketry was incessant, the thunder of cannon never ceased.An officer wild with excitement came spurring his foaming horse up to
General Wallace."General McClernand wants help," he gasped."The whole Rebel army has
attacked his division.""I have orders from General Grant to hold this position at all hazards,"
replied Wallace.To Grant's headquarters the officer rides in frantic haste.The general
was away; he had started at five o'clock to see Commodore Foote, who had
been wounded in the battle of the night before, and was on board of one
of his gunboats, and the boats lay some five or six miles below.Would not some one of his staff give orders to send reinforcements to
McClernand.The officer groaned,
and rode back to McClernand with the heavy tidings.Minutes go by, the thunder of battle is terrific.The exultant cheering of the advancing foe is heard above the
roar of conflict.Another officer, with his horse bleeding from wounds, his hat gone, and
tears streaming down his face, rides to General Wallace."For God's
sake, help!"he gasps, "or everything is lost; we are flanked, we cannot
hold out longer."Then General Wallace said: "I will take the responsibility; help you
shall have."And with his face lighted up with joy the officer dashed
back to tell McClernand that help was coming.An order comes to General Cruft to at once march his brigade to the
scene of action.No sooner is the command given than the brigade is on
the way.Soon shot and shell are crashing overhead, and singing bullets
begin to cut the twigs of the bushes around.Now and then a soldier
falters and goes down.A smooth-faced, florid man rides up to General
Cruft."I am Colonel Oglesby," he says; "my brigade is being flanked on
the right.Let me lead you in position; my men are nearly out of
ammunition."And then as calmly as if on parade Colonel Dick Oglesby
leads Cruft's brigade to the relief of his men.Soon the brigade is in
the midst of the conflict.The excitement of battle is on him, and he feels no fear.Oglesby's brigade is out of ammunition.Sullenly his men fall back,
leaving over 800 of their number dead and wounded on the field, but his
left regiment refuses to go.The colonel, a large, dark man, with hair
as black as midnight, eyes like flaming stars, rages up and down the
line like a lion.Fred asks of a wounded soldier hobbling back."Colonel John A. Logan," is the answer.At last his men are out of ammunition, and Logan, bleeding from two
wounds, is obliged to lead his regiment back.Another regiment takes its
place, and after a dreadful conflict, is compelled to fall back, leaving
over 300 of their number dead and wounded.Cruft's brigade was now on the extreme right, cut off from the rest of
the army.The enemy pressed upon them; a withering volley sent them
reeling back.Fred spurred forward, and seizing
the colors of a Kentucky regiment, shouted: "Now, boys, for the honor of
old Kentucky."But on either flank
the enemy pressed, and the brigade, combating every foot, was forced
back.The enemy had gained the desired end; McClernand's division was out of
the way, the road to retreat was open.Because of the imbecility of Generals Floyd and Pillow.Broken, and with a third of its number dead and wounded, McClernand's
division is driven back on Lew Wallace.Officers, stunned with the
disaster, come wildly galloping through Wallace's lines, shouting, "All
is lost!Wallace changes front to meet the exultant, advancing foe.Firm as
adamant his lines stand.In the faces of the charging Confederates his
men pour their crushing volleys.The enemy waver, reel, then go
staggering, bleeding back.In conference with Commodore Foote on
board of a gunboat six miles down the river.He is too far away to hear
the roll of musketry, and the thunder of artillery he thinks but
cannonading between the two lines.It is past noon when the conference
is ended and he is rowed ashore.There stands a staff officer with
bloodless face and shaking limbs.In a few words the story of the
disaster is told.Without a word Grant listens, and then mounts his
horse.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was a commission as captain, and detailed him as an independent
scout, subject to the orders of General William Nelson."Why, General," stammered Fred, "I didn't want this.You know, you told
me it was better for me not to enlist.""I know," responded Nelson, "but as you are with the army so much, it is
better for you to wear a uniform and have a rank that will command
respect."So Fred became "captain" in earnest.During his conversations with Nelson, Fred told him what he had heard
his father say to his aunt about Grant and Buell being crushed in
detail, and the general became thoroughly imbued with the idea that the
army at Pittsburg Landing was in grave danger.He chafed like a caged tiger at the delay in crossing Duck
river.At length he sought Buell, who laughed at his fears, and said
that he would not move until the bridge was completed."Why, Nelson, what's the matter with you any way?""Here we have been puttering
with this bridge for nearly a week, and all this time the force at
Pittsburg Landing is in danger of being attacked and annihilated."Buell leaned back in his chair, and looking quizzically at Nelson, said:

"You seem to know more about it, General, than either Halleck or Grant.Halleck telegraphed me that there is no danger of the force at Pittsburg
Landing being attacked.""I don't care what Halleck telegraphs," roared Nelson, now thoroughly
aroused."I tell you there is; I feel it, I know it."asked Buell, showing considerable interest.A small force encamped only
twenty miles from Corinth, where Johnston is concentrating his army.Johnston is a fool if he doesn't attack, and no one yet has ever accused
him of being one.General, give my division the advance; let me ford
Duck river."Buell was really fond of Nelson, despite his rough, overbearing ways,
and after some hesitation gave him the required permission.The life of
General Grant might not read as it does now, if that permission had been
withheld.On the morning of March 29th Nelson's division forded Duck river, and
started on its forced march for Savannah, on the Tennessee river.On
this march Nelson showed no mercy to stragglers, and many were the
curses heaped upon his head.One day Fred found a boy, no older than himself, lashed behind a cannon.The lad belonged to an Indiana regiment that in some manner had incurred
the displeasure of the general, and he was particularly severe on
members of this regiment if found straggling.The boy in question had
been found away from his command, and had been tied by his wrists to a
cannon.Behind this gun he had to march through the mud, every jolt
sending sharp pain through his wrists and arms, and if he should fall
life itself would be imperiled.It was a heartless, and in this case,
cruel punishment.Fred noticed the boy, and rode up to him and asked him
his name, and he gave it as Hugh Raymond.He was a fine-looking fellow,
and seemed to feel deeply his humiliation.He was covered with mud, and
the tears that he could not hold back had left their dirty trail down
his cheeks.Fred went to Nelson, begged for the boy's release, and got
it.It was but few requests that Nelson would not grant Fred.When Nelson started on his march to Savannah he expected to reach that
place on April 7th.But once on the march his eagerness increased, and
he resolved to reach Savannah, if possible, by the 4th, or at least the
5th of the month.On the morning of the third day's march Fred met with an adventure that
haunted him for years afterward.He never thought of it without a
shudder, and over and over again he lived it in his dreams, awaking with
a cry of agony that sounded unearthly to those who heard it.General Nelson and staff had put up at the commodious house of a planter
named Lane.They were most hospitably entertained, although Mr.Lane
made no secret of the fact that he was an ardent sympathizer with the
South.In the morning, as Fred was about to mount his horse to resume the
march, he discovered that he had left his field-glass in the room he had
occupied during the night.On returning for it, he heard voices in the
next room, one of which sounded so familiar that he stopped a moment to
listen, and to his amazement recognized the voice of his cousin Calhoun.One thing was certain; he
had been exchanged and was once more in the army.Lane
were engaged in earnest conversation, and Fred soon learned that his
cousin had been concealed in the house during the night."I have," replied Calhoun, "thanks to your kindness.I heard Nelson say
he would rush his division through, and that he wanted to be in Savannah
by the 5th.Johnston must,
shall strike Grant before that time.I must be in Corinth within the
next twenty-four hours, if I kill a dozen horses in getting there.Is
my horse where I left him, at the stable in the woods?"Lane; "and well cared for and groomed.But
breakfast is ready; you must eat a hearty meal before you start."Fred realized that the fate of an army was at stake.Something must be
done, and that something must be done quickly.Slipping out of the
house, he took a look around.Back of the house about a half a mile
distant was a thick piece of wood.A lane led through the fields to this
wood.No doubt it was there that Calhoun's horse was concealed.Fred quickly made up his mind what to do.Mounting his horse, he rode
rapidly away until out of sight of the house; then, making Prince jump
the fence, he rode through the field until he reached the wood, and then
back nearly to the lane he had noticed.Tying his horse, he crept close
to the path, and concealed himself.He soon saw
Calhoun coming up the path with quick, springing steps.To Fred's great
joy he was alone.He let him pass, and then stealthily as an Indian
followed him.Calhoun soon reached the rude stable, and went in."Now, my hearty," said he, as he patted his horse, "we have a long hard
ride before us.But we carry news, my boy--news that may mean
independence to the Sunny South."Strong arms were suddenly thrown around him, and despite his desperate
resistance and struggles, he soon found himself lying on his face, his
hands held behind his back and securely tied.His ankles were then
firmly bound together.When all this was done he was raised to his feet
and a voice said:

"Sorry, Cal, but I had to do it," and to Calhoun's amazement his cousin
stood before him, panting from his exertion.For a moment Calhoun was speechless with astonishment; then his rage
knew no limit, and bound as he was, he tried to get at his cousin."I reckon," said Fred, quietly, "that I must make you more secure," and
taking a stout strap he lashed him securely to a post."Is this the way you keep your oath?"hissed Calhoun, and he spat at
Fred in his contempt."Loose me, you sneaking villain, loose me at once,
or I will raise an alarm, and Mr.Lane and his men will be here, and
they will make short work of you."Just then the notes of a bugle, sweet and clear, came floating through
the air."You had better raise no alarm;
McCook's division is passing, and I have but to say a word and you
swing."Calhoun ground his teeth in impotent rage.At last he asked:

"Fred, what do you want?Have you not sworn to
guard my life as sacredly as your own?"Fred stood looking at his cousin a moment, as if in deep thought; then
an expression of keenest pain came over his face, and he said in a
strained, unnatural voice:

"Calhoun, believe me, I would I were dead instead of standing before you
as I do now.""I should think that you would, if you have a vestige of honor left,"
answered Calhoun, with a sneer."An oath, which an honorable man would
hold more sacred than life itself seems to be lightly regarded by you.""I shall come to that directly," replied Fred, in the same unnatural
tone.To him his voice sounded afar off, as if some one else were
talking."Now, Calhoun, listen; you have a secret, a secret on which the fate of
an army depends."Calhoun, you have been
playing the spy again.do you hear the tramp of McCook's columns.If I did my duty I would cry, 'Here is a spy,' and what then?"Calhoun's face grew ashen; then his natural bravery came to his rescue."I defy you," he exclaimed, his eyes flaming with wrath."Hang me if you
will, and then in the sight of God behold yourself a murderer worse than
Cain.""Calhoun, once more I say, listen.The information that you have you
shall not take to Johnston.What I do now
would hang me instead of you, if Buell knew.But I trust you with more
than life; I trust you with my honor.Give me your sacred word that you
will keep away from Corinth until after Buell and Grant have joined
forces; promise as sacredly that you will not directly or indirectly
divulge in any manner to any person the knowledge you have gained, and I
will release you."Calhoun looked Fred in the face, hesitated, and then slowly answered:
"You seem to think I have more honor and will keep an oath better than
yourself."Calhoun," he cried, "you do not, you cannot mean
it.Promise, for the love of heaven,
promise!""I will not promise, I will die first," replied Calhoun, doggedly.A
faint hope was arising in his mind that Fred was only trying to frighten
him; that he had only to remain firm, and that, at the worst, Fred would
only try to keep him a prisoner.Calhoun's words were to Fred as a sentence of death.He sank on his
knees, and lifted his hands imploringly."Calhoun," he moaned, "see me, see me here at your feet.It is I, not
you, who is to be pitied.For the love we bear each other"--at the word
"love" Calhoun's lips curled in contempt--"for the sake of those near
and dear to us, for the honor of our names, promise, oh, promise me!"See, I spit on you, I despise you, defy
you.""Then you must die," replied Fred, slowly rising to his feet."Fred, you will not give me up to be
hanged?""No, Calhoun, your dishonor would be my dishonor.I cannot keep my oath,
and have you hanged as a spy.""I shall shoot you with my own hand.""You do not, cannot mean
that?""It is the only way I can keep my oath and still prevent you from
carrying the news that would mean destruction to Grant's army."How can you keep your oath by
murdering me?""Calhoun, I swore to consider your honor as sacred as my own, to value
your life as highly as my own, to share with you whatever fate might
come.After I put a bullet through your heart, I
shall put one through my own brain._We both must die._"

Calhoun's face seemed frozen with horror.He gasped and tried to speak,
but no words came."Calhoun," continued Fred, in a tone that sounded as a voice from one
dead, "would that you had promised, for it can do no good not to
promise.Now, say your prayers, for in a
moment we both will be standing before our Maker."Fred bowed his head in silent prayer; but Calhoun, with his
horror-stricken face, never took his eyes from off his cousin."Good-bye, Calhoun," said Fred, as he raised his revolver."For God's sake, don't shoot!The words seemed to explode
from Calhoun's lips.[Illustration: "For God's Sake, don't shoot!For a moment Fred stood as motionless as a statue, with the revolver
raised; then the weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and with a low
moan he plunged forward on his face.So long did he lie in a swoon that Calhoun thought he was dead, and
called to him in the most endearing tones.At last there was a slight
quivering of the limbs, then he began to moan; finally he sat up and
looked around as one dazed.Seeing Calhoun, he started, passed his hand
across his brow as if to collect his thoughts, and said, as if in
surprise: "Why, Calhoun----" Then it all came back to him in its terror
and awfulness, and he fell back sick and faint.Rallying, he struggled
to his feet, tottered to Calhoun, and cut the bonds that bound him."It will not do for us to be found here
together."The two boys clasped hands for a moment, then each turned and went his
separate way.When Fred joined Nelson an hour later the general looked at him sharply,
and asked: "What's the matter, Fred?You look ten years
older than you did yesterday.""I am not really sick, but I am not feeling well, General," replied
Fred; "and I believe, with your permission, I will take an ambulance for
the rest of the day.""Do, Fred, do," kindly replied Nelson, and for the rest of the day Fred
rode in an ambulance, where he could be alone with his thoughts.That evening he asked General Nelson when he expected the division would
reach Savannah."By the 5th, if possible, on the 6th anyway," answered the general."Make it the 5th, General; don't let anything stop you; hurry!Nelson looked after him and muttered: "I wonder what's the matter with
the boy; he hasn't appeared himself to-day; but it may be he will be all
right in the morning.I shall take his advice and hurry, anyway."The next day Nelson urged on his men with a fury that caused the air to
be blue with oaths.And it was well that he did, or Shiloh would have
never been reached in time to aid the gallant soldiers of Grant.Buell saw no need of hurrying.He thought it would be a fine thing to
concentrate his whole army at Waynesborough and march into Savannah with
flying colors, showing Grant what a grand army he had.He telegraphed
General Halleck for permission to do so, and the request was readily
granted.In some manner it became known to the Confederate spies that
Buell's army was to halt at Waynesborough, and the glad tidings were
quickly borne to General Johnston, and when that general marched forth
to battle he had no expectation that he would have to meet any of
Buell's men.General Buell hurried forward to stop Nelson at Waynesborough, according
to his plan; but to his chagrin he found that Nelson, in his headlong
haste, was already beyond Waynesborough, and so the plan of stopping him
had to be given up.When General Nelson's advance was a little beyond Waynesborough, a party
engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Savannah to
Nashville was met.A telegram was handed their general, which read:


     TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING BUELL'S ADVANCE:

     There is no need of haste; come on by easy stages.U. S. GRANT,
     Major-General Commanding.Nelson read the telegram, and turning to Fred said:

"This is small comfort for all my hurry.I wonder if I have made a fool
of myself, after all.Buell will have the joke on me, sure.""Better be that way than have you needed and not there," answered Fred."If we are needed and are not there, Grant can only blame himself," was
Nelson's reply.At noon on April 5th Ammen's brigade, the advance of Nelson's division,
marched into Savannah.Colonel Ammen reported his arrival, and said:

"My men are not tired; we can march on to Pittsburg Landing if
necessary."The answer was: "Rest, and make your men comfortable.There will be no
battle at Pittsburg Landing.Boats will be sent for you in a day or
two."There was to be a rude awakening on the morrow."The sun of Austerlitz" was neither brighter nor more glorious than the
sun which arose over the field of Shiloh Sunday morning, April 6, 1862.Around the little log chapel, wont to echo to the voice of prayer and
song of praise, along the hillsides and in the woods, lay encamped the
Federal army.The soldiers had lain down the night before without a
thought of what this bright, sunny Sabbath would bring forth.A sense of
security pervaded the whole army.From commander down to private, there
was scarcely a thought of an attack."I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack," wrote Grant to Halleck
on April 5th.On the evening of the same day Sherman wrote to Grant: "I do not
apprehend anything like an attack upon our position."Yet when these words were written the Confederate army was in battle
array not much over three miles distant.But there was one general in the Federal army who was uneasy, he hardly
knew why.He was little known at the time, he never held a
distinguished command afterward; yet it was by his vigilance that the
Federal army was saved from surprise, perhaps from capture.A vague idea that something was wrong haunted him.The
ominous silence in front oppressed him, as something to be feared.An unusual number of squirrels and
rabbits were noticed dodging through the line, and they were all headed
in one direction--toward Pittsburg Landing.To guard more surely against surprise Prentiss posted his pickets a mile
and a half in front of his lines, an unusual distance.At three o'clock
Sunday morning he sent three companies of the Twenty-fifth Missouri out
on a reconnoitering expedition.These three companies followed a road
that obliqued to the right, and a little after daylight met the enemy's
advance in front of Sherman's division.Thus the battle of Shiloh
opened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the
Confederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen
minutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major
Hardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he
fought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general
advance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along
the line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston
Johnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was
fired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along
the whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been
fighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was
startled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily
writing an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his
division up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left
his breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon
steaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of
General Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace
hold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his
chief-of-staff, Grant said:

"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of
raw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are
all right.""It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,"
answered Rawlins."Yes," answered Grant, "but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general
attack."It sounds very much like it," replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all
doubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men
had commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to
come at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem
the tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments
which had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most
needed.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his
generals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and
all would be well.Some of his regiments
had broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of
danger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,
pleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be
careful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: "If
I can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it."Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: "General, I did not
expect this; forgive me.""I am your senior general," answered Sherman."You depended on me for
reports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an
attack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by
my side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward."There is nothing to forgive," he said, gently."The mistake is mine as well as yours.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will
soon be here, and we will whip them; never fear."By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond
his camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.
Wallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the
field was afterward known as the "Hornet's Nest."Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told
them to hold it to the last man."We will," responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat
against them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and
bleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army
were bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken
soldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:
"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry."Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the
Union lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised
Johnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments
had been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus
gain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time
hurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to
charge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and
said: "I will lead you, my children."With wild cheers his men pressed forward;
nothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was
crushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate
army stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died
away, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the
respite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to
pieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of
General Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With
anxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the
first fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer
reports: "Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further
from the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead
of hurrying forward left in front.Then he
is marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face."He
countermarched; coming slow," he said, as if to himself, "Great God,
what does he mean?"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: "Plant the siege guns around the
Landing.See that you have every available piece of artillery in
position."And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between
Grant's army and utter rout."Have you any way of retreat mapped out?"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,
viewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of
demoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: "Retreat!I
have not yet despaired of victory."Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from
the center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'
divisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and
Prentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten
o'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their
lines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung
every time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every
side.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he
was cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than
Wallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were
doomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last
stand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides
up to him."General," he says, "Sherman reports that he has taken his last
position.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what
stragglers he has gathered."Go back," quietly said Grant, "and tell Sherman to hold if possible;
night is most here."McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had
furnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now
an orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,
came spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:

"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most
gallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable
reason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the
Landing.""Go tell McClernand," said Grant, "that he has done well, but he must
hold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up."General," he said, in a broken voice, "my division is gone, the whole
left is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.""General," replied Grant, without a quiver, "rally what broken regiments
and stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on
McClernand, and hold your position to the last man."Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and
soldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there.""The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."Guest_ (_on bidding her host good-night_).I can assure you my gown

"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector."The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material.His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses--new in those
days--new in very deed."I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice.""You said not that," pursued IRETON--for it was he--"when you called
upon CHARLES to lose his head.""But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him."This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed IRETON sternly."OLIVER,
you are playing the fool.You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty.""Well, I cannot help it," was the response."But mind you, IRETON, it
shall be the last time.""What is it that attracts you so strongly?What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?""I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me.To-day

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *

attempt to make such a thoroughly useless, and, indeed, revolutionary
discovery.It is enough to turn anyone into a democrat at once.And what
was Lord SALISBURY, as a Conservative, doing, in allowing such a subject
to be mooted at Oxford?Why did he not at once turn the new gas off at
the meter?*       *       *       *       *

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.[Illustration]

From HENRY SOTHERAN & CO.(so a worthy Baronite reports) comes a second
edition of _Game Birds and Shooting Sketches_, by JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS.Every sportsman who is something more than a mere bird-killer ought to
buy this beautiful book.MILLAIS' drawings are wonderfully delicate,
and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate.He has a fine touch for
plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and resolute
bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own peculiar
haunts.I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr.MILLAIS in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr.Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him.MILLAIS will consider the matter in his third edition.*       *       *       *       *

  "Or a bad 'brace of ducks' that has lowered your pride?"With a low-muttered swear-word or two he replied,
    "Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"He said "In the mud one can't score, anyhow,
    Singing willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!The people are raising a deuce of a row,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!I've been waiting all day in these flannels--they're damp!--

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the
country.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.*       *       *       *       *

On the night of the 7th of April we camped on Buffalo River.Moving at an
early hour on the 8th, we crossed the Lynchburg Railroad at Prospect
Station, and headed for Appomattox Station, where it was expected we would
strike, if not intercept, Lee's retreating, disintegrating army.The trail
was fresh and the chase hot.Joy beamed in every eye, for all felt that
the end was drawing near, and we earnestly hoped that ours might be the
glorious opportunity of striking the final blow.About noon the regiment
was detached to capture a force of the enemy said to be at one of the
crossings of the Appomattox.Some few hundreds, unarmed, half-starved,
stragglers, with no fight in them, were found, and turned over to the
Provost Marshall.Resuming its place in the column, I received orders to
report with the regiment to General Custer, who was at its head.Reporting
in compliance with this order, General Custer informed me that his scouts
had reported three large trains of cars at Appomattox Station, loaded with
supplies for the rebel army; that he expected to have made a junction
with Merritt's division near this point; that his orders were to wait here
till Merritt joined him; that he had not heard from him since morning, and
had sent an officer to communicate with him, but if he did not hear from
him in half an hour, he wished me to take my regiment and capture the
trains of cars, and, if possible, reach and hold the pike to Lynchburg.While talking, the whistle of the locomotive was distinctly but faintly
heard, and the column was at once moved forward, the Second New York in
advance.As we neared the station the whistles became more and more
distinct, and a scout reported the trains rapidly unloading, and that the
advance of the rebel army was passing through Appomattox Court House.Although Custer's orders were to make a junction with Merritt before
coming in contact with the enemy, here was a chance to strike a decisive
blow, which, if successful, would add to his renown and glory, and if not,
Merritt would soon be up to help him out of the scrape.Our excitement was
intense, but subdued.All saw the vital importance of heading off the
enemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the
question.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the
trains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my
shoulder, said, "Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is
the chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you."The regiment
left the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we
caught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a
cheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three
trains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and
firemen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men
around me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered
the trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were
claimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with
commissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the
rebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly
down on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a
fierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did
but little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by
a dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel
Pennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily
skirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily
constructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which
immense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was
ordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's
lines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest
of the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then
Custer, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and
charge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without
organization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and
everywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize
was so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel
infantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and
destruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so
as soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,
only to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting
would not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the
offensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I
went to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would
let me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He
excitedly replied, "Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything
you can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold
of the pike to-night."Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by
me, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other
regiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge
down a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery
was posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright
lights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot
swept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The
line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.All saw the vital importance of heading off the
enemy.Another whistle, nearer and clearer, and another scout decided the
question.I was ordered to move rapidly to Appomattox Station, seize the
trains there, and, if possible, get possession of the Lynchburg pike.General Custer rode up alongside of me and, laying his hand on my
shoulder, said, "Go in, old fellow, don't let anything stop you; now is
the chance for your stars.Whoop 'em up; I'll be after you."The regiment
left the column at a slow trot, which became faster and faster until we
caught sight of the cars, which were preparing to move away, when, with a
cheer, we charged down on the station, capturing in an instant the three
trains of cars, with the force guarding them.I called for engineers and
firemen to take charge of the trains, when at least a dozen of my men
around me offered their services.I chose the number required, and ordered
the trains to be run to the rear, where I afterwards learned they were
claimed as captures by General Ord's corps.The cars were loaded with
commissary stores, a portion of which had been unloaded, on which the
rebel advance were regaling themselves when we pounced so unexpectedly
down on them.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a
fierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did
but little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by
a dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel
Pennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily
skirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily
constructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which
immense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was
ordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's
lines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest
of the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then
Custer, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and
charge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without
organization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and
everywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize
was so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel
infantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and
destruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so
as soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,
only to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting
would not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the
offensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I
went to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would
let me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He
excitedly replied, "Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything
you can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold
of the pike to-night."Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by
me, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other
regiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge
down a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery
was posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright
lights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot
swept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The
line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his

congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again."He's a skilly man, Doctor MacLure," continued my friend Mrs.Macfayden,
whose judgment on sermons or anything else was seldom at fault; "an'
a kind-hearted, though o' coorse he hes his faults like us a', an' he
disna tribble the Kirk often."He aye can tell what's wrang wi' a body, an' maistly he can put ye
richt, and there's nae new-fangled wys wi' him: a blister for the
ootside an' Epsom salts for the inside dis his wark, an' they say
there's no an herb on the hills he disna ken."If we're tae dee, we're tae dee; an' if we're tae live, we're tae live,"
concluded Elspeth, with sound Calvinistic logic; "but a'll say this
for the doctor, that whether yir tae live or dee, he can aye keep up a
sharp meisture on the skin.""But he's no veera ceevil gin ye bring him when there's naethin' wrang,"
and Mrs.Macfayden's face reflected another of Mr.Hopps' misadventures
of which Hillocks held the copyright."Hopps' laddie ate grosarts (gooseberries) till they hed to sit up a'
nicht wi' him, an' naethin' wud do but they maun hae the doctor, an' he
writes 'immediately' on a slip o' paper."Weel, MacLure had been awa a' nicht wi' a shepherd's wife Dunleith wy,
and he comes here withoot drawin' bridle, mud up tae the cen."'What's a dae here, Hillocks?"he cries; 'it's no an accident, is't?'and when he got aff his horse he cud hardly stand wi' stiffness and
tire."'It's nane o' us, doctor; it's Hopps' laddie; he's been eatin' ower
mony berries.'[Illustration: "HOPPS' LADDIE ATE GROSARTS"]

"If he didna turn on me like a tiger."<DW37> ye mean tae say----'

"'Weesht, weesht,' an' I tried tae quiet him, for Hopps wes comin' oot."'Well, doctor,' begins he, as brisk as a magpie, 'you're here at last;
there's no hurry with you Scotchmen.My boy has been sick all night, and
I've never had one wink of sleep.You might have come a little quicker,
that's all I've got to say.'"We've mair tae dae in Drumtochty than attend tae every bairn that hes a
sair stomach,' and a' saw MacLure wes roosed.Our doctor at home always says to
Mrs.'Opps "Look on me as a family friend, Mrs.'Opps, and send for me
though it be only a headache."'"'He'd be mair sparin' o' his offers if he hed four and twenty mile tae
look aifter.There's naethin' wrang wi' yir laddie but greed.Gie him a
gude dose o' castor oil and stop his meat for a day, an' he 'ill be a'
richt the morn.'"'He 'ill not take castor oil, doctor.We have given up those barbarous
medicines.'"'Whatna kind o' medicines hae ye noo in the Sooth?'MacLure, we're homoeopathists, and I've my little
chest here,' and oot Hopps comes wi' his boxy."'Let's see't,' an' MacLure sits doon and taks oot the bit bottles, and
he reads the names wi' a lauch every time."'Belladonna; did ye ever hear the like?Weel, ma mannie,' he says tae Hopps, 'it's a fine
ploy, and ye 'ill better gang on wi' the Nux till it's dune, and gie him
ony ither o' the sweeties he fancies."'Noo, Hillocks, a' maun be aff tae see Drumsheugh's grieve, for he's
doon wi' the fever, and it's tae be a teuch fecht.A' hinna time tae
wait for dinner; gie me some cheese an' cake in ma haund, and Jess 'ill
tak a pail o' meal an' water."'Fee; a'm no wantin' yir fees, man; wi' that boxy ye dinna need a
doctor; na, na, gie yir siller tae some puir body, Maister Hopps,' an'
he was doon the road as hard as he cud lick."His fees were pretty much what the folk chose to give him, and he
collected them once a year at Kildrummie fair."Well, doctor, what am a' awin' ye for the wife and bairn?Ye 'ill need
three notes for that nicht ye stayed in the hoose an' a' the veesits.""Havers," MacLure would answer, "prices are low, a'm hearing; gie's
thirty shillings.""No, a'll no, or the wife 'ill tak ma ears off," and it was settled for
two pounds.Lord Kilspindie gave him a free house and fields, and one
way or other, Drumsheugh told me, the doctor might get in about L150.a year, out of which he had to pay his old housekeeper's wages and a
boy's, and keep two horses, besides the cost of instruments and books,
which he bought through a friend in Edinburgh with much judgment.There was only one man who ever complained of the doctor's charges, and
that was the new farmer of Milton, who was so good that he was above
both churches, and held a meeting in his barn.(It was Milton the Glen
supposed at first to be a Mormon, but I can't go into that now.)He
offered MacLure a pound less than he asked, and two tracts, whereupon
MacLure expressed his opinion of Milton, both from a theological and
social standpoint, with such vigor and frankness that an attentive
audience of Drumtochty men could hardly contain themselves.Jamie Soutar
was selling his pig at the time, and missed the meeting, but he hastened
to condole with Milton, who was complaining everywhere of the doctor's
language.[Illustration]

"Ye did richt tae resist him; it 'ill maybe roose the Glen tae mak a
stand; he fair hands them in bondage."Thirty shillings for twal veesits, and him no mair than seeven mile
awa, an' a'm telt there werena mair than four at nicht."Ye 'ill hae the sympathy o' the Glen, for a' body kens yir as free wi'
yir siller as yir tracts."Wes't 'Beware o' gude warks' ye offered him?Man, ye choose it weel,
for he's been colleckin' sae mony thae forty years, a'm feared for him."A've often thocht oor doctor's little better than the Gude Samaritan,
an' the Pharisees didna think muckle o' his chance aither in this warld
or that which is tae come."When I saw him coming
home, I used to look at his face while he was yet a long way off,
and, oh, dear!how happy I felt when he smiled; for then I knew he
had got no letter.He had grown so handsome; like his father, only
fairer, and more gentle-looking.And, then, he had such a voice; when
he sat at the door in the evening-sun, singing towards the mountain
ridge, and listening to the echo, I felt that live without him.If I only saw him, or knew he was somewhere near, and he
seemed pretty happy, and would only give me a word now and then, I
wanted nothing more on earth, and I wouldn't have shed one tear
less."But just when he seemed to be getting on better with people, and
felt happier among them, there came a message from the post-office
that a fourth letter had come; and in it were two hundred dollars!I
thought I should have fell flat down where I stood: what could I do?The letter, I might get rid of, 'twas true; but the money?For two or
three nights I couldn't sleep for it; a little while I left it
up-stairs, then, in the cellar behind a barrel, and once I was so
overdone that I laid it in the window so that he might find it.But
when I heard him coming, I took it back again.At last, however, I
found a way: I gave him the money and told him it had been put out at
interest in my mother's lifetime.He laid it out upon the land, just
as I thought he would; and so it wasn't wasted.But that same
harvest-time, when he was sitting at home one evening, he began
talking about Christian, and wondering why he had so clean forgotten
him."Now again the wound opened, and the money burned me so that I was
obliged to go out of the room.I had sinned, and yet my sin had
answered no end.Since then, I have hardly dared to look into his
eyes, blessed as they are."The mother who has sinned against her own child is the most
miserable of all mothers;... and yet I did it only out of love....
And so, I dare say, I shall be punished accordingly by the loss of
what I love most.For since the middle of the winter, he has again
taken to singing the tune that he used to sing when he was longing to
go away; he has sung it ever since he was a lad, and whenever I hear
it I grow pale.Then I feel I could give up all for him; and only see
this."She took from her bosom a piece of paper, unfolded it and gave
it to the Clergyman."He now and then writes something here; I think
it's some words to that tune.... I brought it with me; for I can't
myself read such small writing... will you look and see if there
isn't something written about his going away...."

There was only one whole verse on the paper.For the second verse,
there were only a few half-finished lines, as if the song was one he
had forgotten, and was now coming into his memory again, line by
line.The first verse ran thus,--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
        Over the mountains high?Now I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine trees grow,
        Waiting and longing to rise
        Nearer the beckoning skies.""Yes, it is about that," replied the Clergyman, putting the paper
down.She sat with folded
hands, looking intently and anxiously into the Clergyman's face,
while tear after tear fell down her cheeks.The Clergyman knew no more what to do in the matter than she did."Well, I think the lad must be left alone in this case," he said."Life can't be made different for his sake; but what he will find in
it must depend upon himself; now, it seems, he wishes to go away in
search of life's good.""But isn't that just what the old crone did?""Yes; she who went away to fetch the sunshine, instead of making
windows in the wall to let it in."The Clergyman was much astonished at Margit's words, and so he had
been before, when she came speak to him on this subject; but,
indeed, she had thought of hardly anything else for eight years."Well, as to the letters, that wasn't quite right.Keeping back what
belonged to your son, can't be justified.But it was still worse to
make a fellow Christian appear in a bad light when he didn't deserve
it; and especially as he was one whom Arne was so fond of, and who
loved him so dearly in return.But we will pray God to forgive you;
we will both pray."Margit still sat with her hands folded, and her head bent down."How I should pray him to forgive me, if I only knew he would stay!"she said: surely, she was confounding our Lord with Arne.The
Clergyman, however, appeared as if he did not notice it."Do you intend to confess it to him directly?"She looked down, and said in a low voice, "I should much like to wait
a little if I dared."The Clergyman turned aside with a smile, and asked, "Don't you
believe your sin becomes greater, the longer you delay confessing
it?"She pulled her handkerchief about with both hands, folded it into a
very small square, and tried to fold it into a still smaller one, but
could not."If I confess about the letters, I'm afraid he'll go away.""Then, you dare not rely upon our Lord?""Oh, yes, I do, indeed," she said hurriedly; and then she added in a
low voice, "but still, if he were to go away from me?""Then, I see you are more afraid of his going away than of continuing
to sin?"Margit had unfolded her handkerchief again; and now she put it to her
eyes, for she began weeping.The Clergyman remained for a while
looking at her silently; then he went on, "Why, then, did you tell me
all this, if it was not to lead to anything?"He waited long, but she
did not answer."Perhaps you thought your sin would become less when
you had confessed it?""Yes, I did," she said, almost in a whisper, while her head bent
still lower upon her breast."Well, well, my good Margit, take
courage; I hope all will yet turn out for the best."she asked, looking up; and a sad smile passed over
her tear-marked face."Yes, I do; I believe God will no longer try you.You will have joy
in your old age, I am sure.""If I might only keep the joy I have!"she said; and the Clergyman
thought she seemed unable to fancy any greater happiness than living
in that constant anxiety."If we had but a little girl, now, who could take hold on him, then
I'm sure he would stay.""You may be sure I've thought of that," she said, shaking her head."Well, there's Eli Boeen; she might be one who would please him.""You may be sure I've thought of that."She rocked the upper part of
her body backwards and forwards."If we could contrive that they might oftener see each other here at
the parsonage?""You may be sure I've thought of that!"She clapped her hands and
looked at the Clergyman with a smile all over her face.He stopped
while he was lighting his pipe."Perhaps this, after all, was what brought you here to-day?"She looked down, put two fingers into the folded handkerchief, and
pulled out one corner of it."Ah, well, God help me, perhaps it was this I wanted."The Clergyman walked up and down, and smiled."Perhaps, too, you came
for the same thing the last time you were here?"She pulled out the corner of the handkerchief still farther, and
hesitated awhile."Well, as you ask me, perhaps I did--yes.""Then, too, it was to carry this point
that you confessed at last the thing you had on your conscience."She spread out the handkerchief to fold it up smoothly again."No;
ah, no; that weighed so heavily upon me, I felt I must tell it to
you, father.""Well, well, my dear Margit, we will talk no more about it."Then, while he was walking up and down, he suddenly added, "Do you
think you would of yourself have come out to me with this wish of
yours?""Well,--I had already come out with so much, that I dare say this,
too, would have come out at last."The Clergyman laughed, but he did not tell her what he thought."Well, we will manage this matter for you,
Margit," he said.She rose to go, for she understood he had now
said all he wished to say."And we will look after them a little.""I don't know how to thank you enough," she said, taking his hand and
courtesying.She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, went towards the door,
courtesied again, and said, "Good bye," while she slowly opened and
shut it.But so lightly as she went towards Kampen that day, she had
not gone for many, many years.When she had come far enough to see
the thick smoke curling up cheerfully from the chimney, she blessed
the house, the whole place, the Clergyman and Arne,--and remembered
they were going to have her favorite dish, smoked ham, for dinner.It was situated in the middle of a
plain, bordered on the one side by a ravine, and on the other, by the
high-road; just beyond the road was a thick wood, with a mountain
ridge rising behind it, while high above all stood blue mountains
crowned with snow.On the other side of the ravine also was a wide
range of mountains, running round the Swart-water on the side where
Boeen was situated: it grew higher as it ran towards Kampen, but then
turned suddenly sidewards, forming the broad valley called the
Lower-tract, which began here, for Kampen was the last place in the
Upper-tract.The front door of the dwelling-house opened towards the road, which
was about two thousand paces off, and a path with leafy birch-trees
on both sides led thither.In front of the house was a little garden,
which Arne managed according to the rules given in his books.The
cattle-houses and barns were nearly all new-built, and stood to the
left hand, forming a square.The house was two stories high, and was
painted red, with white window-frames and doors; the roof was of turf
with many small plants growing upon it, and on the ridge was a
vane-spindle, where turned an iron cock with a high raised tail.Spring had come to the mountain-tracts.It was Sunday morning; the
weather was mild and calm, but the air was somewhat heavy, and the
mist lay low on the forest, though Margit said it would rise later in
the day.Arne had read the sermon, and sung the hymns to his mother,
and he felt better for them himself.Now he stood ready dressed to go
to the parsonage.When he opened the door the fresh smell of the
leaves met him; the garden lay dewy and bright in the morning breeze,
but from the ravine sounded the roaring of the waterfall, now in
lower, then again in louder booms, till all around seemed to tremble.As he went farther from the fall, its booming
became less awful, and soon it lay over the landscape like the deep
tones of an organ.the mother said, opening the
window and looking after him till he disappeared behind the shrubs.The mist had gradually risen, the sun shone bright, the fields and
garden became full of fresh life, and the things Arne had sown and
tended grew and sent up odor and gladness to his mother."Spring is
beautiful to those who have had a long winter," she said, looking
away over the fields, as if in thought.Arne had no positive errand at the parsonage, but he thought he might
go there to ask about the newspapers which he shared with the
Clergyman.Recently he had read the names of several Norwegians who
had been successful in gold digging in America, and among them was
Christian.His relations had long since left the place, but Arne had
lately heard a rumor that they expected him to come home soon.About
this, also, Arne thought he might hear at the parsonage; and if
Christian had already returned, he would go down and see him between
spring and hay-harvest.These thoughts occupied his mind till he came
far enough to see the Swart-water and Boeen on the other side.There,
too, the mist had risen, but it lay lingering on the mountain-sides,
while their peaks rose clear above, and the sunbeams played on the
plain; on the right hand, the shadow of the wood darkened the water,
but before the houses the lake had strewed its white sand on the flat
shore.All at once, Arne fancied himself in the red-painted house
with the white doors and windows, which he had taken as a model for
his own.He did not think of those first gloomy days he had passed
there, but only of that summer they both saw--he and Eli--up beside
her sick-bed.He had not been there since; nor would he have gone for
the whole world.If his thoughts but touched on that time, he turned
crimson; yet he thought of it many times a day; and if anything could
have driven him away from the parish, it was this.He strode onwards, as if to flee from his thoughts; but the farther
he went, the nearer he came to Boeen, and the more he looked at it.The mist had disappeared, the sky shone bright between the frame of
mountains, the birds floated in the sunny air, calling to each other,
and the fields laughed with millions of flowers; here no thundering
waterfall bowed the gladness to submissive awe, but full of life it
gambolled and sang without check or pause.Arne walked till he became glowing hot; then he threw himself down on
the grass beneath the shadow of a hill and looked towards Boeen, but
he soon turned away again to avoid seeing it.Then he heard a song
above him, so wonderfully clear as he had never heard a song before.It came floating over the meadows, mingled with the chattering of the
birds, and he had scarcely recognized the tune ere he recognized the
words also: the tune was the one he loved better than any; the words
were those he had borne in his mind ever since he was a boy, and had
forgotten that same day they were brought forth.He sprang up as if
he would catch them, but then stopped and listened while verse after
verse came streaming down to him:--

   "What shall I see if I ever go
      Over the mountains high?Now, I can see but the peaks of snow,
    Crowning the cliffs where the pine-trees grow,
      Waiting and longing to rise
      Nearer the beckoning skies."Th' eagle is rising afar away,
      Over the mountains high,
    Rowing along in the radiant day
    With mighty strokes to his distant prey,
      Where he will, swooping downwards,
      Where he will, sailing onwards."Apple-tree, longest thou not to go
      Over the mountains high?Gladly thou growest in summer's glow,
    Patiently waitest through winter's snow:
      Though birds on thy branches swing,
      Thou knowest not what they sing."He who has twenty years longed to flee
      Over the mountains high--
    He who beyond them, never will see,
    Smaller, and smaller, each year must be:
      He hears what the birds, say
      While on thy boughs they play."Birds, with your chattering, why did ye come
      Over the mountains high?Beyond, in a sunnier land ye could roam,
    And nearer to heaven could build your home;
      Why have ye come to bring
      Longing, without your wing?"Shall I, then, never, never flee
      Over the mountains high?Rocky walls, will ye always be
    Prisons until ye are tombs for me?--
      Until I lie at your feet
      Wrapped in my winding-sheet?I will away, afar away,
      Over the mountains high!Here, I am sinking lower each day,
    Though my Spirit has chosen the loftiest way;
      Let her in freedom fly;
      Not, beat on the walls and die!"_Once_, I know, I shall journey far
      Over the mountains high.Lord, is thy door already ajar?--
    Dear is the home where thy saved ones are;--
      But bar it awhile from me,
      And help me to long for Thee."Arne stood listening till the sound of the last verse, the last words
died away; then he heard the birds sing and play again, but he dared
not move.Yet he must find out who had been singing, and he lifted
his foot and walked on, so carefully that he did not hear the grass
rustle.A little butterfly settled on a flower at his feet, flew up
and settled a little way before him, flew up and settled again, and
so on all over the hill.But soon he came to a thick bush and
stopped; for a bird flew out of it with a frightened "quitt, quitt!"and rushed away over the sloping hill-side.Then she who was sitting
there looked up; Arne stooped low down, his heart throbbed till he
heard its beats, he held his breath, and was afraid to stir a leaf;
for it was Eli whom he saw.After a long while he ventured to look up again; he wished to draw
nearer, but he thought the bird perhaps had its nest under the bush,
and he was afraid he might tread on it.Then he peeped between the
leaves as they blew aside and closed again.She wore a close-fitting black dress with long white sleeves,
and a straw hat like those worn by boys.In her lap a book was lying
with a heap of wild flowers upon it; her right hand was listlessly
playing with them as if she were in thought, and her left supported
her head.She was looking away towards the place where the bird had
flown, and she seemed as if she had been weeping.Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or dreamed of in all
his life; the sun, too, had spread its gold over her and the place;
and the song still hovered round her, so that Arne thought,
breathed--nay, even his heart beat, in time with it.It seemed so
strange that the song which bore all his longing, _he_ had forgotten,
but _she_ had found.A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times, till at last she
saw it and frightened it away with a flower-stalk, which she put up
as often as it came before her.Then she took up the book and opened
it, but she soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song.He could hear it was "The Tree's early leaf-buds,"
though she often made mistakes, as if she did not quite remember
either the words or the tune.The verse she knew best was the last
one, and so she often repeated it; but she sang it thus:--

   "The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:
    'May I gather thy berries?''Yes; all thou canst see;
        Take them; all are for thee.'Said the Tree--trala--lala, trala, lala--said."Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers around her,
and sang till the tune trembled through the air, and might have been
heard at Boeen.Arne had thought of coming forwards when she began
singing; he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he felt
he _must_ come, but she went away.No!--There she skipped over the hillocks singing; here her hat fell
off, there she took it up again; here she picked a flower, there she
stood deep in the highest grass.It was a long while ere he ventured to peep out
again; at first he only raised his head; he could not see her: he
rose to his knees; still he could not see her: he stood upright; no
she was gone.He thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his mind.Now he would not go to the parsonage.He would not have the
newspapers; would not know anything about Christian.He would not go
home; he would go nowhere; he would do nothing."Oh, God, I am so unhappy!"He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds" till the
mountains resounded.Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and took up the flowers
she had picked, but he flung them away again down the hill on every
side.It was long since he had done so; this struck
him, and made him weep still more.He would go far away, that he
would; no, he would not go away!He thought he was very unhappy; but
when he asked himself why, he could hardly tell.It
was a lovely day; and the Sabbath rest lay over all.The lake was
without a ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling, and though
the little birds continued their twittering, they went towards the
shade of the wood; the dewdrops were gone, and the grass looked
grave; not a breath of wind stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun
was near the meridian.Almost before he knew, he found himself seated
putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;
and while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune
went and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be
sung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:

   "He went in the forest the whole day long,
    The whole day long;
    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,
    A wondrous song."He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,
    A willow spray,
    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,
    The sweet tune lay."It whispered and told him its name at last,
    Its name at last;
    But then, while he listened, away it passed,
    Away it passed."But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,
    Again it stole,
    With touches of love upon his soul,
    Upon his soul."Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,
    And keep it fast;
    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,
    I' the night it passed."'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,
    In the night, I pray;
    For the tune has taken my heart away,
    My heart away.'"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,
    It is thy friend,
    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,
    Thy longing end;

   "'And all the others are nothing to thee,
    Nothing to thee,
    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,
    Never shalt see.'"SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME."Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday
evening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from
church, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock."Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.She hurried
down the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen
playing there with her brother and the Clergyman's son."Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God bless you all."She blushed crimson and wanted to leave
off the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them
to let her go for that evening."I almost think I know you," said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother."Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck
and shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom
fluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed
because she was so out of breath."Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling happy as
she looked at her."P'r'aps you don't know me?"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her
name, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her
before."No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps
you know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother," said Margit, with a
stolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly."I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.""It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in
before I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.""There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli suggested."Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I
suppose?""Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have
plenty of help."Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to
talk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on."Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing
anybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways."Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a
dress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower
hooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little
turned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape
of a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore
the first time Margit danced with him."A pretty stud," she said, looking at it."Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and
Margit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask
also about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen."The farm has improved very much these last few years,
and it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows
now, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a
first-rate way."Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then
asked her age."Have you helped in the house-work?Not much, I dare say--you look so
spruce."Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late."Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when
one gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before
her, why, it doesn't matter so much."Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond
the grounds of the parsonage."It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would
chat a little longer with me."Then Margit began to talk about Arne."I don't know if you know much
of him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear
me, what a deal he has read!"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal."Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but
the way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something
more, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his
mother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to
complain of."Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint."Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be
rewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she
ought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar."I only dropped a little twig I had."I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit
alone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings
blessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad
that day."They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;
but soon Eli stopped."One of my shoe-strings has come down."Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied."He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got cowed while he was
a child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything
by himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli
must see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late
that day."There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.""No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back."Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but there's sure to be
somebody else about;" and Eli had now less objection to it."If only I shall not be too late," she said."Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too
late, I dare say.""Being brought up at the
Clergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?""It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less."No; that, Eli thought she would never have."Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still
folks about here haven't much learning."Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her."No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come
farther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is
Kampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;
but that doesn't matter much, after all."Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood."It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named
Opplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him
that piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be
lonely."Soon they came far enough to see Kampen."Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun
shone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked
down over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house
with its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the
pale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in
stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep
and goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and
the milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of
the waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this
filled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it
whizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that
she unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that
Margit begged her to come on a little faster."I never
heard anything like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened.""You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.""Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said, turning
downwards from the road, into the path."Those trees on each side,
Nils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so
does Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out."exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden
fence."We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now we must go over to
look at the creatures before they're locked in--" But Eli did not
hear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking
at it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a
furtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as
they passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by
one to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would
calve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs
which Arne had got from the South."He aims at all such things," said
Margit, "though one wouldn't think it of him."Then they went into
the barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli
had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found everywhere," Margit
said.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what
kind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind."No less
than three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're
set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,
the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for
there he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it
for manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes
here will find things in good order, I'm sure."Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all
that Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the
garden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,
she begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little
garden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try
it, for she rose directly."Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late," said Margit, as
she stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli
would not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had
been at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they
looked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother
generally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and
pleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock
and a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but
with new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English
fishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and
showed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was
without painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any
in the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the
green mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the
background.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;
for in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne
brought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and
so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name
was painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable
and unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and
now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; "all the best
things were there," the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but
they were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked
towards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household
things not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and
other bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;
so did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of
them twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while
more interested."Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the mother, taking it
from under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it
looked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the
waterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the
spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one
place farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it
just where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into
the depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with
fresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had
grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and
twisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had
not a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled
and bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When
Eli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;
next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green
mountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to
the room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the
Clergyman had more.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his
money.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and
if everything went right they would have some more."But, after all,
money's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better
still," she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to
see, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother
showed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,
were taken out and looked at."I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,
my child," she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had
scarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by
the hand and said in a low voice, "Look at that little red chest;
there's something very choice in that, you may be sure."Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she
thought she would very much like to have."He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest," the mother
whispered; "and he always hides the key."She went to some clothes
that hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the
pocket, and there found the key."Now come and look," she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt
down before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an
odor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen
anything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away."Here, look," she whispered, taking out a fine black
silk neckerchief such as men do not wear."It looks just as if it
was meant for a girl," the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap
and looked at it, but did not say a word."Here's one more," the
mother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother
insisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her
head down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a
neckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They
folded them up again, but slowly."Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands."Everything seems as if it was for a girl."Eli blushed crimson, but
she said nothing."There's some more things yet," said the mother,
taking out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,
her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she
would fain have turned away, but that she could not well do."He has bought something every time he has been to town," continued
the mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from
one thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and
her face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything
like them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they
could be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her
fingers left warm marks on them."I'm hot, I think," she whispered."Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after
another, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?""He has kept them here in this chest--so long."She
laid them all in the chest again, just as they were before."Now
we'll see what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the lid
carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially
beautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,
two gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and
with silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver
of the book she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Boeen."The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,
but saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and
spreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her
hand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without
either of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *

A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the
mother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for
now Arne would soon be at home.Then she came out in the garden to
Eli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw
Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;
but she had been weeping."There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit, caressing her;
"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne," she added, as a black
figure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was
nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not
look at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat
down on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,
and Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the
door and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,
but then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the
wall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines
into the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but
then bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,
but wept still more.She leant
her head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she
did not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save
that of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant
and subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;
Arne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then."Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne," she said,
coming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her
good, she said.*       *       *       *       *

Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and
Arne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of
those light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd
together, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been
accustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and
goes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but
not life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out
between the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to
hear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,
which is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and
thinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they
felt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be
taken from them."I can hardly believe it," Arne said."I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily before her."_Yet it's true_," he said, laying stress on each word; "now I am no
longer going about only thinking; for once I have done something."He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly."No, it
was not I," he said; "it was mother who did it."He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,
"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, "God be thanked
that I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to
see many things which would not have been as they ought...." Then
after a while he added, "But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I
should have gone on alone for ever.""What do you think father will say, dear?"asked Eli, who had been
busy with her own thoughts."I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning," said
Arne;--"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself," he added, determining
he would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things
again; no, never!"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the
nut-wood?""And the tune I had made it for, you got hold
of, too.""I took the one which suited it," she said, looking down.He smiled
joyfully and bent his face down to hers."But the other song you did not know?"she asked looking up....

"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...
yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill."She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed."Then, after all,
you have been served just right," she said."Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well
... another time...."

"Nay; tell it me now."She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, "Surely, you haven't
been up-stairs?"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked
down."Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep
back her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her
still closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his
eyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but
could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned
aside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange
shapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat
with two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was
the nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the
picture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly
rent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the
cliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to
move; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke
and twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and
then from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept
once more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness
lying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words
himself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that
she might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It
was a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in
morning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards
the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while
the women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the
stern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards
Boeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Boeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces
of cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new
clothes, and looking distantly at each other; an old woman sat lonely
and weeping on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.She
wore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the
upper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on
their wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering
refreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in
Eli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who
had come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was
dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar
that Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,
standing at the window where she wrote "Arne."It was open, and he
leant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the
distant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in
the day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,
where he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye
came, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his
fair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a
quiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had
just come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was
tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but
with a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew
to one side.Each had something to say to
the other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more
embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned
towards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, "Perhaps you'll
come too."Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long
while about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking
out from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took
from his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of
wine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though
he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank
some himself, but offered it to her several times while he was
drinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the
cup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, "I'm so
happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long
while since I did so."Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went
on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated
us two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone
farther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken
into our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,
if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so
that we can never more be separated?"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head
down upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no
answer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice
asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"Birgit raised her
head, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face."Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave
her hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but
they clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty
years.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to
the door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard
looked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and
followed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the
rowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said
how strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad."Ah,
whether it wishes to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all
along the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife."Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE

THE CHOICEST ANECDOTES AND SAYINGS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY MARK LEMON

16mo.Here is an interest for a minute or a
dull day.Mark Lemon gives us the result of his recondite searches
and seizures in the regions of infinite jest.Like all good jesters,
he has the quality of sound philosophy in him, and of reason also,
for he discriminates closely, and serves up his wit with a deal of
refinement in it.""So exquisitely is the book printed, that every jest in it shines
like a new gold dollar.It is the apotheosis of jokes.... There is
jollity enough in it to keep the whole American press good humored.""Mark Lemon, who helps to flavor Punch, has gathered this volume of
anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and we have no
fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of some wisdom
and much amusement.By this single 'Lemon' we judge of the rest.""This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth, and as
such, it will be useful in driving dull care away.""It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become all the
better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until now never
had a local habitation and a name.""For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or more likely
to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or study."Neither can it be
doubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might
make the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their
rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur manœuvres.In
like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,
or for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such
occasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as
shewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark
that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited
than the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by
means of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both
carcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from
the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of
the third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or
three vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the
storming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest
stress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not
therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket
carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as
the 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the
10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a
Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell
thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_
throwing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the
_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question
that an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,
is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of
ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow
succession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,
and a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the
general basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due
proportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be
attained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to
exceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily
        produce more destruction than when they happen in
        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as
        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of
fortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is
the only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried
into a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets
may accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is
infinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would
enable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only
to scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or
passage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;
but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,
while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as
to the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets.The
frame is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of
the legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for
which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,
therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,
each of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it
with the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by
the haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the
frame being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into
the stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by
a trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men
are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail
set, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually
prevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to
the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;
it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself
discharged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a
six-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is
evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as
well as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or
tanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and
an attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as
from its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is
no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the
marine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the
burthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,
so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the
point of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:
insomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest
mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the
smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell
Rockets recochét in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is
another use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be
passed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a
ship by boarding.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short
stick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the
Rocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with
10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes
are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by
hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,
so as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual
destruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst
the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by
the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect
has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when
they enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER
SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;
by which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these
ships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending
entirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided
in the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and
shell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly
close together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and
top-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives
for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these
racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents
uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which
can be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged
merely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a
considerable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen
to the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will
have returned into safety before any discharge takes place.It is
evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be
calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the
fire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in
the most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to
have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it
is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with
clouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power
of destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass
harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats
in towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely
precluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any
boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth
shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had
an opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French
Fleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was
ascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it
in the enemy.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire
Rockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every
vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the
gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the
smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;
the sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either
by iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the
Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,
as shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and
frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of
war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all
positions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any
possibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these
ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for
bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,
are capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even
24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description
of small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for
general service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be
fitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described
in Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or
the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a
small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside
of the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small
vessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not
carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:
it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore
OWEN’s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and
some with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig.4]




ROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition
which have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion
Rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell
Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and
light natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number
of inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the
24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to
the 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are
from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,
or bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks
are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in
the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in
each case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole
of this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same
facility as the medium and light parts.These Rockets are fired from
bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;
or they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may
also be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the
purposes of explosion.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less
diameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are
therefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the
demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been
realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not
its only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses
than can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project
which, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,
mortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers
of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to
specify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally
used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of
bombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders
them in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them
as medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds
of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and
may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,
either for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations
of three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks
in the centre also strongly bound together.The great art of firing
these _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by
priming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of
powder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42
and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the
32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch
howitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the
least Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed
either with shot or shell, for field service.The 24-pounder Rocket is
very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the
saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly
equal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,
is armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a
6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder
with a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast
expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing
the resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description
of case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity
of musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the
Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained
in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be
given in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates
the balls.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained
in a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in
the shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,
are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be
instantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,
by a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the
bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the
Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden
fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can
be necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is
regulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving
any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden
fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By
this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a
facility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar
operations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient
length for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they
are made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose
issuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell
and case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the
mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,
according to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements
used for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of
different sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they
belong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to
accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into
the stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix
it immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not
hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the
different natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of
speculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter
found a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or
projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of
combining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively
a shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the
Rocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is
required at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be
carried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as
in Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by
a slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the
air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the
parachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended
in the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will
continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere
for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will
float in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived
and unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the
disengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is
not only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every
Rocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal
case, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage
from humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board
of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less
than eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to
render them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere
expense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,
case, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable
as ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1–15]

CONCLUSION.Calculations proving the comparative Economy of the Rocket Ammunition,
both as to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the
expense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true
understanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest
mode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the
field.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,
which has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with
the 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._

If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used
instead of manual labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be
reduced four-fifths, which would lower the amount to about 18_s._
each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted, which I am
endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of
the projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the
comparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of
the charge of powder required to convey it the same distance._s._  _d._

                                                         ------------


So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an
actual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains
more composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing
any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and
that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together
with the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of
throwing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the
use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed £5; and indeed,
on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that
a transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with
every thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while
on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the
requisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need
specifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,
when compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch
spherical carcass costs £1.17_s._ 11½_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the
32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, does not cost more than £1.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case
there is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11½_d._ Now the large
Rocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the
difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the
different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least
double, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the
other comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15
to 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in
the first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate
economy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to
the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than £3.10_s._ that is to
say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,
though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration
are half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is
evident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets
may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling
mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch
shell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or
conflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the
first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a
comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the
Rocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.It was sounded by
twanging the strings, and also by the application of the bow.The first
method was, of course, the elder one.There can hardly be a doubt
that when the bow came into use it was applied to certain popular
instruments which previously had been treated like the _cithara_ or
the _psalterium_.The Hindus at the present day use their _suroda_
sometimes as a lute and sometimes as a fiddle.In some measure we
do the same with the violin by playing occasionally _pizzicato_.The
_rotta_ (shown p.Blasius is called in
Gerbert’s work _cithara teutonica_, while the harp is called _cithara
anglica_; from which it would appear that the former was regarded as
pre-eminently a German instrument.Possibly its name may have been
originally _chrotta_ and the continental nations may have adopted it
from the Celtic races of the British isles, dropping the guttural
sound.This hypothesis is, however, one of those which have been
advanced by some musical historians without any satisfactory evidence.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

We engrave also another representation of David playing on the
_rotta_, from a psalter of the seventh century in the British museum
(Cott.According to tradition, this psalter is one of
the manuscripts which were sent by pope Gregory to St.The instrument much resembles the lyre in the hand of the musician
(see p.22) who is supposed to be a Hebrew of the time of Joseph.In
the _rotta_ the ancient Asiatic lyre is easily to be recognized.An
illumination of king David playing the _rotta_ forms the frontispiece
of a manuscript of the eighth century preserved in the cathedral
library of Durham; and which is musically interesting inasmuch as
it represents a _rotta_ of an oblong square shape like that just
noticed and resembling the Welsh _crwth_.It has only five strings
which the performer twangs with his fingers.Again, a very interesting
representation (which we engrave) of the Psalmist with a kind of
_rotta_ occurs in a manuscript of the tenth century, in the British
museum (Vitellius F.The manuscript has been much injured by
a fire in the year 1731, but Professor Westwood has succeeded, with
great care, and with the aid of a magnifying glass, in making out
the lines of the figure.As it has been ascertained that the psalter
is written in the Irish semi-uncial character it is highly probable
that the kind of _rotta_ represents the Irish _cionar cruit_, which
was played by twanging the strings and also by the application of a
bow.Unfortunately we possess no well-authenticated representation
of the Welsh _crwth_ of an early period; otherwise we should in all
probability find it played with the fingers, or with a plectrum.Venantius Fortunatus, an Italian who lived in the second half of the
sixth century, mentions in a poem the “Chrotta Britanna.” He does
not, however, allude to the bow, and there is no reason to suppose
that it existed in England.Howbeit, the Welsh _crwth_ (Anglo-saxon,
_crudh_; English, _crowd_) is only known as a species of fiddle closely
resembling the _rotta_, but having a finger-board in the middle of the
open frame and being strung with only a few strings; while the _rotta_
had sometimes above twenty strings.As it may interest the reader to
examine the form of the modern _crwth_ we give a woodcut of it.Edward
Jones, in his “Musical and poetical relicks of the Welsh bards,”
records that the Welsh had before this kind of _crwth_ a three-stringed
one called “Crwth Trithant,” which was, he says, “a sort of violin, or
more properly a rebeck.” The three-stringed _crwth_ was chiefly used by
the inferior class of bards; and was probably the Moorish fiddle which
is still the favourite instrument of the itinerant bards of the Bretons
in France, who call it _rébek_.The Bretons, it will be remembered, are
close kinsmen of the Welsh.[Illustration]

A player on the _crwth_ or _crowd_ (a crowder) from a bas-relief on the
under part of the seats of the choir in Worcester cathedral (engraved
p.95) dates from the twelfth or thirteenth century; and we give (p.96) a copy of an illumination from a manuscript in the Bibliothèque
royale at Paris of the eleventh century.The player wears a crown on
his head; and in the original some musicians placed at his side are
performing on the psalterium and other instruments.These last are
figured with uncovered heads; whence M. de Coussemaker concludes that
the _crout_ was considered by the artist who drew the figures as the
noblest instrument.It was probably identical with the _rotta_ of the
same century on the continent.[Illustration]

An interesting drawing of an Anglo-saxon fiddle--or _fithele_, as it
was called--is given in a manuscript of the eleventh century in the
British museum (Cotton, Tiberius, c.The instrument is of a pear
shape, with four strings, and the bridge is not indicated.A German
fiddle of the ninth century, called _lyra_, copied by Gerbert from the
manuscript of St.These are shown in the
woodcuts (p.Other records of the employment of the fiddle-bow
in Germany in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are not wanting.For instance, in the famous ‘Nibelungenlied’ Volker is described as
wielding the fiddle-bow not less dexterously than the sword.And in
‘Chronicon picturatum Brunswicense’ of the year 1203, the following
miraculous sign is recorded as having occurred in the village of
Ossemer: “On Wednesday in Whitsun-week, while the parson was fiddling
to his peasants who were dancing, there came a flash of lightning
and struck the parson’s arm which held the fiddle-bow, and killed
twenty-four people on the spot.”

Among the oldest representations of performers on instruments of the
violin kind found in England those deserve to be noticed which are
painted on the interior of the roof of Peterborough cathedral.They
are said to date from the twelfth century.One of these figures is
particularly interesting on account of the surprising resemblance which
his instrument bears to our present violin.Not only the incurvations
on the sides of the body but also the two sound-holes are nearly
identical in shape with those made at the present day.Respecting the
reliance to be placed on such evidence, it is necessary to state that
the roof, originally constructed between the years 1177 and 1194, was
thoroughly repaired in the year 1835.Although we find it asserted that
“the greatest care was taken to retain every part, or to restore it
to its original state, so that the figures, even where retouched, are
in effect the same as when first painted,” it nevertheless remains a
debatable question whether the restorers have not admitted some slight
alterations, and have thereby somewhat modernised the appearance of
the instruments.A slight touch with the brush at the sound-holes, the
screws, or the curvatures, would suffice to produce modifications which
might to the artist appear as being only a renovation of the original
representation, but which to the musical investigator greatly impair
the value of the evidence.Sculptures are, therefore, more to be
relied upon in evidence than frescoes.[Illustration]

CHAPTER VIII.The construction of the _organistrum_ requires but little explanation.A glance at the finger-board reveals at once that the different
tones were obtained by raising the keys placed on the neck under the
strings, and that the keys were raised by means of the handles at
the side of the neck.Of the two bridges shown on the body, the one
situated nearest the middle was formed by a wheel in the inside, which
projected through the sound-board.The wheel which slightly touched
the strings vibrated them by friction when turned by the handle at
the end.The order of intervals was _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_,
_b-flat_, _b-natural_, _c_, and were obtainable on the highest string.There is reason to suppose that the other two strings were generally
tuned a fifth and an octave below the highest.The _organistrum_ may
be regarded as the predecessor of the hurdy-gurdy, and was a rather
cumbrous contrivance.Two persons seem to have been required to sound
it, one to turn the handle and the other to manage the keys.Thus it is
generally represented in mediæval concerts.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _monochord_ (p.100) was mounted with a single string stretched
over two bridges which were fixed on an oblong box.The string could be
tightened or slackened by means of a turning screw inserted into one
end of the box.The intervals of the scale were marked on the side, and
were regulated by a sort of movable bridge placed beneath the string
when required.As might be expected, the _monochord_ was chiefly used
by theorists; for any musical performance it was but little suitable.About a thousand years ago when this monochord was in use the musical
scale was diatonic, with the exception of the interval of the seventh,
which was chromatic inasmuch as both _b-flat_ and _b-natural_ formed
part of the scale.The notation on the preceding page exhibits the
compass as well as the order of intervals adhered to about the tenth
century.This ought to be borne in mind in examining the representations of
musical instruments transmitted to us from that period.As regards the wind instruments popular during the middle ages, some
were of quaint form as well as of rude construction.The _chorus_, or _choron_, had either one or two tubes, as in the
woodcut page 101.There were several varieties of this instrument;
sometimes it was constructed with a bladder into which the tube is
inserted; this kind of _chorus_ resembled the bagpipe; another kind
resembled the _poongi_ of the Hindus, mentioned page 51.The name
_chorus_ was also applied to certain stringed instruments.One of
these had much the form of the _cithara_, page 86.It appears however,
probable that _chorus_ or _choron_ originally designated a horn
(Hebrew, _Keren_; Greek, _Keras_; Latin, _cornu_).[Illustration]

The flutes of the middle ages were blown at the end, like the
flageolet.Of the _syrinx_ there are extant some illustrations of the
ninth and tenth centuries, which exhibit the instrument with a number
of tubes tied together, just like the Pandean pipe still in use.In one
specimen engraved (page 102) from a manuscript of the eleventh century
the tubes were inserted into a bowl-shaped box.This is probably the
_frestele_, _fretel_, or _fretiau_, which in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries was in favour with the French ménétriers.Some large Anglo-saxon trumpets may be seen in a manuscript of the
eighth century in the British museum.The largest kind of trumpet was
placed on a stand when blown.Of the _oliphant_, or hunting horn, some
fine specimens are in the South Kensington collection.The _sackbut_
(of which we give a woodcut) probably made of metal, could be drawn
out to alter the pitch of sound.The sackbut of the ninth century had,
however, a very different shape to that in use about three centuries
ago, and much more resembled the present _trombone_.The name _sackbut_
is supposed to be a corruption of _sambuca_.The French, about the
fifteenth century, called it _sacqueboute_ and _saquebutte_.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The most important wind instrument--in fact, the king of all the
musical instruments--is the organ.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The _pneumatic organ_ is sculptured on an obelisk which was erected
in Constantinople under Theodosius the great, towards the end of the
fourth century.The bellows were pressed by men standing on them:
see page 103.This interesting monument also exhibits performers on
the double flute.The _hydraulic organ_, which is recorded to have
been already known about two hundred years before the Christian era,
was according to some statements occasionally employed in churches
during the earlier centuries of the middle ages.Probably it was more
frequently heard in secular entertainments for which it was more
suitable; and at the beginning of the fourteenth century appears to
have been entirely supplanted by the pneumatic organ.The earliest
organs had only about a dozen pipes.The largest, which were made
about nine hundred years ago, had only three octaves, in which the
chromatic intervals did not occur.Some progress in the construction
of the organ is exhibited in an illustration (engraved p.104) dating
from the twelfth century, in a psalter of Eadwine, in the library of
Trinity college, Cambridge.The instrument has ten pipes, or perhaps
fourteen, as four of them appear to be double pipes.It required four
men exerting all their power to produce the necessary wind, and two men
to play the instrument.Moreover, both players seem also to be busily
engaged in directing the blowers about the proper supply of wind.It must be admitted that since the twelfth
century some progress has been made, at all events, in the construction
of the organ.[Illustration]

The pedal is generally believed to have been invented by Bernhard, a
German, who lived in Venice about the year 1470.There are, however,
indications extant pointing to an earlier date of its invention.Perhaps Bernhard was the first who, by adopting a more practicable
construction, made the pedal more generally known.On the earliest
organs the keys of the finger-board were of enormous size, compared
with those of the present day; so that a finger-board with only nine
keys had a breadth of from four to five feet.The organist struck the
keys down with his fist, as is done in playing the _carillon_ still in
use on the continent, of which presently some account will be given.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

Of the little portable organ, known as the _regal_ or _regals_,
often tastefully shaped and embellished, some interesting sculptured
representations are still extant in the old ecclesiastical edifices
of England and Scotland.There is, for instance, in Beverley minster
a figure of a man playing on a single regal, or a regal provided
with only one set of pipes; and in Melrose abbey the figure of an
angel holding in his arms a double regal, the pipes of which are in
two sets.The regal generally had keys like those of the organ but
smaller.A painting in the national Gallery, by Melozzo da Forli
who lived in the fifteenth century, contains a regal which has keys
of a peculiar shape, rather resembling the pistons of certain brass
instruments.To avoid misapprehension, it is necessary to mention that the name
_regal_ (or _regals_, _rigols_) was also applied to an instrument
of percussion with sonorous slabs of wood.This contrivance was, in
short, a kind of harmonica, resembling in shape as well as in the
principle of its construction the little glass harmonica, a mere toy,
in which slips of glass are arranged according to our musical scale.In England it appears to have been still known in the beginning of the
eighteenth century.Grassineau describes the “Rigols” as “a kind of
musical instrument consisting of several sticks bound together, only
separated by beads.It makes a tolerable harmony, being well struck
with a ball at the end of a stick.” In the earlier centuries of the
middle ages there appear to have been some instruments of percussion in
favour, to which Grassineau’s expression “a tolerable harmony” would
scarcely have been applicable.Drums, of course, were known; and their
rhythmical noise must have been soft music, compared with the shrill
sounds of the _cymbalum_; a contrivance consisting of a number of metal
plates suspended on cords, so that they could be clashed together
simultaneously; or with the clangour of the _cymbalum_ constructed
with bells instead of plates; or with the piercing noise of the
_bunibulum_, or _bombulom_; an instrument which consisted of an angular
frame to which were loosely attached metal plates of various shapes
and sizes.The lower part of the frame constituted the handle: and to
produce the noise it evidently was shaken somewhat like the sistrum of
the ancient Egyptians.[Illustration]

The _triangle_ nearly resembled the instrument of this name in use
at the present day; it was more elegant in shape and had some metal
ornamentation in the middle.The _tintinnabulum_ consisted of a number of bells arranged in regular
order and suspended in a frame.[Illustration]




CHAPTER IX.Respecting the orchestras, or musical bands, represented on monuments
of the middle ages, there can hardly be a doubt that the artists who
sculptured them were not unfrequently led by their imagination rather
than by an adherence to actual fact.It is, however, not likely that
they introduced into such representations instruments that were never
admitted in the orchestras, and which would have appeared inappropriate
to the contemporaries of the artists.An examination of one or two
of the orchestras may therefore find a place here, especially as
they throw some additional light upon the characteristics of the
instrumental music of mediæval time.A very interesting group of music performers dating, it is said, from
the end of the eleventh century is preserved in a bas-relief which
formerly ornamented the abbey of St.Georges de Boscherville and which
is now removed to the museum of Rouen.The orchestra comprises twelve
performers, most of whom wear a crown.The first of them plays upon
a viol, which he holds between his knees as the violoncello is held.His instrument is scarcely as large as the smallest viola da gamba.By
his side are a royal lady and her attendant, the former playing on an
_organistrum_ of which the latter is turning the wheel.Next to these
is represented a performer on a _syrinx_ of the kind shown in the
engraving p.112; and next to him a performer on a stringed instrument
resembling a lute, which, however, is too much dilapidated to be
recognisable.Then we have a musician with a small stringed instrument
resembling the _nablum_, p.The next musician, also represented as
a royal personage, plays on a small species of harp.Then follows a
crowned musician playing the viol which he holds in almost precisely
the same manner as the violin is held.Again, another, likewise
crowned, plays upon a harp, using with the right hand a plectrum
and with the left hand merely his fingers.The last two performers,
apparently a gentleman and a gentlewoman, are engaged in striking the
_tintinnabulum_,--a set of bells in a frame.[Illustration]

In this group of crowned minstrels the sculptor has introduced a
tumbler standing on his head, perhaps the vocalist of the company, as
he has no instrument to play upon.Possibly the sculptor desired to
symbolise the hilarious effects which music is capable of producing, as
well as its elevating influence upon the devotional feelings.[Illustration]

The two positions in which we find the viol held is worthy of notice,
inasmuch as it refers the inquirer further back than might be expected
for the origin of our peculiar method of holding the violin, and the
violoncello, in playing.There were several kinds of the viol in use
differing in size and in compass of sound.The most common number of
strings was five, and it was tuned in various ways.One kind had a
string tuned to the note [Illustration] running at the side of the
finger-board instead of over it; this string was, therefore, only
capable of producing a single tone.The four other strings were tuned
thus: [Illustration] Two other species, on which all the strings
were placed over the finger-board, were tuned: [Illustration] and:
[Illustration] The woodcut above represents a very beautiful _vielle_;
French, of about 1550, with monograms of Henry II.The contrivance of placing a string or two at the side of the
finger-board is evidently very old, and was also gradually adopted on
other instruments of the violin class of a somewhat later period than
that of the _vielle_; for instance, on the _lira di braccio_ of the
Italians.It was likewise adopted on the lute, to obtain a fuller power
in the bass; and hence arose the _theorbo_, the _archlute_, and other
varieties of the old lute.[Illustration:

  A. REID.ORCHESTRA, TWELFTH CENTURY, AT SANTIAGO.]A grand assemblage of musical performers is represented on the
Portico della gloria of the famous pilgrimage church of Santiago da
Compostella, in Spain.This triple portal, which is stated by an
inscription on the lintel to have been executed in the year 1188,
consists of a large semicircular arch with a smaller arch on either
side.The central arch is filled by a tympanum, round which are
twenty-four life-sized seated figures, in high relief, representing the
twenty-four elders seen by St.John in the Apocalypse, each with an
instrument of music.These instruments are carefully represented and
are of great interest as showing those in use in Spain at about the
twelfth century.A cast of this sculpture is in the Kensington museum.In examining the group of musicians on this sculpture the reader will
probably recognise several instruments in their hands, which are
identical with those already described in the preceding pages.The
_organistrum_, played by two persons, is placed in the centre of the
group, perhaps owing to its being the largest of the instruments rather
than that it was distinguished by any superiority in sound or musical
effect.Besides the small harp seen in the hands of the eighth and
nineteenth musicians (in form nearly identical with the Anglo-saxon
harp) we find a small triangular harp, without a front-pillar, held on
the lap by the fifth and eighteenth musicians.The _salterio_ on the
lap of the tenth and seventeenth musicians resembles the dulcimer, but
seems to be played with the fingers instead of with hammers.The most
interesting instrument in this orchestra is the _vihuela_, or Spanish
viol, of the twelfth century.The first, second, third, sixth, seventh,
ninth, twentieth, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth
musicians are depicted with a _vihuela_ which bears a close resemblance
to the _rebec_.The instrument is represented with three strings,
although in one or two instances five tuning-pegs are indicated.A
large species of _vihuela_ is given to the eleventh, fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth musicians.This instrument differs from the
_rebec_ in as far as its body is broader and has incurvations at the
sides.Also the sound-holes are different in form and position.The bow
does not occur with any of these viols.But, as will be observed, the
musicians are not represented in the act of playing; they are tuning
and preparing for the performance, and the second of them is adjusting
the bridge of his instrument.[Illustration: FRONT OF THE MINSTRELS’ GALLERY, EXETER CATHEDRAL.The minstrels’ gallery of Exeter cathedral dates from the fourteenth
century.The front is divided into twelve niches, each of which
contains a winged figure or an angel playing on an instrument of music.There is a cast also of this famous sculpture at South Kensington.The
instruments are so much dilapidated that some of them cannot be clearly
recognized; but, as far as may be ascertained, they appear to be as
follows:--1.The _clarion_, a small
trumpet having a shrill sound.The _gittern_, a
small guitar strung with catgut.The _timbrel_;
resembling our present tambourine, with a double row of gingles._Cymbals._ Most of these instruments have been already noticed in the
preceding pages.The _shalm_, or _shawm_, was a pipe with a reed in
the mouth-hole.The _wait_ was an English wind instrument of the same
construction.If it differed in any respect from the _shalm_, the
difference consisted probably in the size only.The _wait_ obtained its
name from being used principally by watchmen, or _waights_, to proclaim
the time of night.Such were the poor ancestors of our fine oboe and
clarinet.CHAPTER X.


POST-MEDIÆVAL MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.Attention must now be drawn to some instruments which originated during
the middle ages, but which attained their highest popularity at a
somewhat later period.[Illustration]

Among the best known of these was the _virginal_, of which we give an
engraving from a specimen of the time of Elizabeth at South Kensington.Another was the _lute_, which about three hundred years ago was almost
as popular as is at the present day the pianoforte.Originally it had
eight thin catgut strings arranged in four pairs, each pair being tuned
in unison; so that its open strings produced four tones; but in the
course of time more strings were added.Until the sixteenth century
twelve was the largest number or, rather, six pairs.Eleven appear
for some centuries to have been the most usual number of strings:
these produced six tones, since they were arranged in five pairs and a
single string.The latter, called the _chanterelle_, was the highest.According to Thomas Mace, the English lute in common use during the
seventeenth century had twenty-four strings, arranged in twelve pairs,
of which six pairs ran over the finger-board and the other six by
the side of it.This lute was therefore, more properly speaking, a
theorbo.The neck of the lute, and also of the theorbo, had frets
consisting of catgut strings tightly fastened round it at the proper
distances required for ensuring a chromatic succession of intervals.The illustration on the next page represents a lute-player of the
sixteenth century.The frets are not indicated in the old engraving
from which the illustration has been taken.The order of tones adopted
for the open strings varied in different centuries and countries:
and this was also the case with the notation of lute music.The most
common practice was to write the music on six lines, the upper line
representing the first string; the second line, the second string, &c.,
and to mark with letters on the lines the frets at which the fingers
ought to be placed--_a_ indicating the open string, _b_ the first fret,
_c_ the second fret, and so on.The lute was made of various sizes according to the purpose for
which it was intended in performance.The treble-lute was of the
smallest dimensions, and the bass-lute of the largest.The _theorbo_,
or double-necked lute which appears to have come into use during
the sixteenth century, had in addition to the strings situated over
the finger-board a number of others running at the left side of
the finger-board which could not be shortened by the fingers, and
which produced the bass tones.The largest kinds of theorbo were the
_archlute_ and the _chitarrone_.It is unnecessary to enter here into a detailed description of some
other instruments which have been popular during the last three
centuries, for the museum at Kensington contains specimens of many
of them of which an account is given in the large catalogue of that
collection.It must suffice to refer the reader to the illustrations
there of the cither, virginal, spinet, clavichord, harpsichord, and
other antiquated instruments much esteemed by our forefathers.Students who examine these old relics will probably wish to know
something about their quality of tone.Might
they still be made effective in our present state of the art?” are
questions which naturally occur to the musical inquirer having such
instruments brought before him.A few words bearing on these questions
may therefore not be out of place here.[Illustration]

It is generally and justly admitted that in no other branch of the art
of music has greater progress been made since the last century than
in the construction of musical instruments.Nevertheless, there are
people who think that we have also lost something here which might
with advantage be restored.Our various instruments by being more and
more perfected are becoming too much alike in quality of sound, or in
that character of tone which the French call _timbre_, and the Germans
_Klangfarbe_, and which professor Tyndall in his lectures on sound has
translated _clang-tint_.Every musical composer knows how much more
suitable one _clang-tint_ is for the expression of a certain emotion
than another.Our old instruments, imperfect though they were in many
respects, possessed this variety of _clang-tint_ to a high degree.Neither were they on this account less capable of expression than the
modern ones.That no improvement has been made during the last two
centuries in instruments of the violin class is a well-known fact.As
to lutes and cithers the collection at Kensington contains specimens
so rich and mellow in tone as to cause musicians to regret that these
instruments have entirely fallen into oblivion.As regards beauty of appearance our earlier instruments were certainly
superior to the modern.Indeed, we have now scarcely a musical
instrument which can be called beautiful.The old lutes, spinets,
viols, dulcimers, &c., are not only elegant in shape but are also often
tastefully ornamented with carvings, designs in marquetry, and painting.[Illustration]

The player on the _viola da gamba_, shown in the next engraving, is
a reduced copy of an illustration in “The Division Violist,” London,
1659.It shows exactly how the frets were regulated, and how the bow
was held.The most popular instruments played with a bow, at that time,
were the _treble-viol_, the _tenor-viol_, and the _bass-viol_.It was
usual for viol players to have “a chest of viols,” a case containing
four or more viols, of different sizes.Thus, Thomas Mace in his
directions for the use of the viol, “Musick’s Monument” 1676, remarks,
“Your best provision, and most complete, will be a good chest of viols,
six in number, viz., two basses, two tenors, and two trebles, all truly
and proportionably suited.” The violist, to be properly furnished with
his requirements, had therefore to supply himself with a larger stock
of instruments than the violinist of the present day.[Illustration]

That there was, in the time of Shakespeare, a musical instrument
called _recorder_ is undoubtedly known to most readers from the stage
direction in Hamlet: _Re-enter players with recorders_.But not many
are likely to have ever seen a recorder, as it has now become very
scarce: we therefore give an illustration of this old instrument, which
is copied from “The Genteel Companion; Being exact Directions for the
Recorder: etc.” London, 1683.The _bagpipe_ appears to have been from time immemorial a special
favourite instrument with the Celtic races; but it was perhaps quite as
much admired by the Slavonic nations.In Poland, and in the Ukraine,
it used to be made of the whole skin of the goat in which the shape
of the animal, whenever the bagpipe was expanded with air, appeared
fully retained, exhibiting even the head with the horns; hence the
bagpipe was called _kosa_, which signifies a goat.120
represents a Scotch bagpipe of the last century.The bagpipe is of high antiquity in Ireland, and is alluded to in Irish
poetry and prose said to date from the tenth century.A pig gravely
engaged in playing the bagpipe is represented in an illuminated Irish
manuscript, of the year 1300: and we give p.121 a copy of a woodcut
from “The Image of Ireland,” a book printed in London in 1581.[Illustration]

The _bell_ has always been so much in popular favour in England that
some account of it must not be omitted.Paul Hentzner a German, who
visited England in the year 1598, records in his journal: “The people
are vastly fond of great noises that fill the ear, such as the firing
of cannon, drums, and the ringing of bells; so that in London it is
common for a number of them that have got a glass in their heads to go
up into some belfry, and ring the bells for hours together for the sake
of exercise.” This may be exaggeration,--not unusual with travellers.It is, however, a fact that bell-ringing has been a favourite amusement
with Englishmen for centuries.The way in which church bells are suspended and fastened, so as to
permit of their being made to vibrate in the most effective manner
without damaging by their vibration the building in which they are
placed, is in some countries very peculiar.The Italian _campanile_, or
tower of bells, is not unfrequently separated from the church itself.In Servia the church bells are often hung in a frame-work of timber
built near the west end of the church.In Zante and other islands of
Greece the belfry is usually separate from the church.The reason
assigned by the Greeks for having adopted this plan is that in case
of an earthquake the bells are likely to fall and, were they placed
in a tower, would destroy the roof of the church and might cause the
destruction of the whole building.Also in Russia a special edifice
for the bells is generally separate from the church.In the Russian
villages the bells are not unfrequently hung in the branches of an
oak-tree near the church.In Iceland the bell is usually placed in the
lych-gate leading to the graveyard.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

The idea of forming of a number of bells a musical instrument such
as the _carillon_ is said by some to have suggested itself first to
the English and Dutch; but what we have seen in Asiatic countries
sufficiently refutes this.Moreover, not only the Romans employed
variously arranged and attuned bells, but also among the Etruscan
antiquities an instrument has been discovered which is constructed of
a number of bronze vessels placed in a row on a metal rod.Numerous
bells, varying in size and tone, have also been found in Etruscan
tombs.Among the later contrivances of this kind in European countries
the sets of bells suspended in a wooden frame, which we find in
mediæval illuminations, deserve notice.In the British museum is a
manuscript of the fourteenth century in which king David is depicted
holding in each hand a hammer with which he strikes upon bells of
different dimensions, suspended on a wooden stand.It may be supposed that the device of playing tunes by means of bells
merely swung by the hand is also of ancient date.In Lancashire each
of the ringers manages two bells, holding one in either hand.Thus, an
assemblage of seven ringers insures fourteen different tones; and as
each ringer may change his two notes by substituting two other bells if
required, even compositions with various modulations, and of a somewhat
intricate character, may be executed,--provided the ringers are good
timeists; for each has, of course, to take care to fall in with his
note, just as a member of the Russian horn band contributes his single
note whenever it occurs.Peal-ringing is another pastime of the kind which may be regarded as
pre-eminently national to England.The bells constituting a peal are
frequently of the number of eight, attuned to the diatonic scale.Also
peals of ten bells, and even of twelve, are occasionally formed.A
peculiar feature of peal-ringing is that the bells, which are provided
with clappers, are generally swung so forcibly as to raise the mouth
completely upwards.The largest peal, and one of the finest, is at
Exeter cathedral: another celebrated one is that of St.Margaret’s,
Leicester, which consists of ten bells.Peal-ringing is of an early
date in England; Egelric, abbot of Croyland, is recorded to have cast
about the year 960 a set of six bells.The _carillon_ (engraved on the opposite page) is especially popular
in the Netherlands and Belgium, but is also found in Germany, Italy,
and some other European countries.It is generally placed in the church
tower and also sometimes in other public edifices.The statement
repeated by several writers that the first carillon was invented in
the year 1481 in the town of Alost is not to be trusted, for the town
of Bruges claims to have possessed similar chimes in the year 1300.There are two kinds of carillons in use on the continent, viz.: clock
chimes, which are moved by machinery, like a self-acting barrel-organ;
and such as are provided with a set of keys, by means of which the
tunes are played by a musician.The carillon in the ‘Parochial-Kirche’
at Berlin, which is one of the finest in Germany, contains thirty-seven
bells; and is provided with a key-board for the hands and with a pedal,
which together place at the disposal of the performer a compass of
rather more than three octaves.The keys of the manual are metal rods
somewhat above a foot in length; and are pressed down with the palms of
the hand.The keys of the pedal are of wood; the instrument requires
not only great dexterity but also a considerable physical power.It
is astonishing how rapidly passages can be executed upon it by the
player, who is generally the organist of the church in which he acts as
_carilloneur_.When engaged in the last-named capacity he usually wears
leathern gloves to protect his fingers, as they are otherwise apt to
become ill fit for the more delicate treatment of the organ.The want of a contrivance in the _carillon_ for stopping the vibration
has the effect of making rapid passages, if heard near, sound as a
confused noise; only at some distance are they tolerable.It must be
remembered that the _carillon_ is intended especially to be heard from
a distance.Successions of tones which form a consonant chord, and
which have some duration, are evidently the most suitable for this
instrument.Indeed, every musical instrument possesses certain characteristics
which render it especially suitable for the production of some
particular effects.The invention of a new instrument of music has,
therefore, not unfrequently led to the adoption of new effects in
compositions.Take the pianoforte, which was invented in the beginning
of the eighteenth century, and which has now obtained so great a
popularity: its characteristics inspired our great composers to the
invention of effects, or expressions, which cannot be properly rendered
on any other instrument, however superior in some respects it may be to
the pianoforte.Thus also the improvements which have been made during
the present century in the construction of our brass instruments, and
the invention of several new brass instruments, have evidently been
not without influence upon the conceptions displayed in our modern
orchestral works.Imperfect though this essay may be it will probably have convinced
the reader that a reference to the history of the music of different
nations elucidates many facts illustrative of our own musical
instruments, which to the unprepared observer must appear misty and
impenetrable.In truth, it is with this study as with any other
scientific pursuit.The unassisted eye sees only faint nebulæ where
with the aid of the telescope bright stars are revealed.Al-Farabi, a great performer on the lute, 57

Transcriber's note:

Inconsistent punctuation and capitalization are as in the original.Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.EMIL GRELIEU

_He walks up and down the room._

JEANNE

Pierre, it will soon be time for you to leave.I'll give you
something to eat at once.Pierre, do you think it is true that
they are killing women and children?PIERRE

It is true, mother.EMIL GRELIEU

How can you say it, Jeanne?JEANNE

I say this on account of the children.Yes, there they write
that they are killing children, so they write there.And
all this was crowded upon that little slip of paper--and the
children, as well as the fire--

_Rises quickly and walks away, humming._

EMIL GRELIEU

Where are you going, Jeanne?JEANNE

Nowhere in particular._Without turning around, François walks out, his shoulders bent.Jeanne goes to the other door with a strange
half-smile._

PIERRE

Mamma!JEANNE

I will return directly.EMIL GRELIEU

What shall I call them?My dear Pierre, my
boy, what shall I call them?PIERRE

You are greatly agitated, father.EMIL GRELIEU

I have always thought, I have always been convinced that words
were at my command, but here I stand before this monstrous,
inexplicable--I don't know, I don't know what to call them.My
heart is crying out, I hear its voice, but the word!Pierre,
you are a student, you are young, your words are direct and
pure--Pierre, find the word!PIERRE

You want me to find it, father?Yes, I was a student, and I knew
certain words: Peace, Right, Humanity.My heart
is crying too, but I do not know what to call these scoundrels.EMIL GRELIEU

That is not strong enough.Pierre, I have decided--

PIERRE

Decided?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I am going.EMIL GRELIEU

I decided to do it several days ago--even then, at the very
beginning.And I really don't know why I--.Oh, yes, I had to
overcome within me--my love for flowers._Ironically._

Yes, Pierre, my love for flowers.Oh, my boy, it is so hard to
change from flowers to iron and blood!PIERRE

Father, I dare not contradict you.EMIL GRELIEU

No, no, you dare not.Listen, Pierre, you
must examine me as a physician.PIERRE

I am only a student, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, but you know enough to say--.You see, Pierre, I must
not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or
weak man.I must bring with me strength and
power, not shattered health.And I am asking
you, Pierre, to examine me, simply as a physician, as a young
physician.Must I
take this off, or can you do it without removing this?PIERRE

It can be done this way.EMIL GRELIEU

I think so, too.And--must I tell you everything, or--?At any
rate, I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments,
and for my years I am a rather strong, healthy man.You know
what a life I am leading.PIERRE

That is unnecessary, father.EMIL GRELIEU

It is necessary.I want to say that in my
life there were none of those unwholesome--and bad excesses.Oh,
the devil take it, how hard it is to speak of it.PIERRE

Papa, I know all this.Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

But it is necessary to take my pulse, Pierre, I beg of you.PIERRE

_Smiling faintly._

It isn't necessary to do even that.As a physician, I can tell
you that you are healthy, but--you are unfit for war, you are
unfit for war, father!I am listening to you and I feel like
crying, father.EMIL GRELIEU

_Thoughtfully._

Yes, yes.Do you think,
Pierre, that I should not kill?Pierre, you think, that I, Emil
Grelieu, must not kill under any circumstances and at any time?PIERRE

_Softly._

I dare not touch upon your conscience, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that is a terrible question for a man.Of course, I could take your gun, but not to fire--no,
that would have been disgusting, a sacrilegious deception!When
my humble people are condemned to kill, who am I that I should
keep my hands clean?That would be disgusting cleanliness,
obnoxious saintliness.My humble nation did not desire to kill,
but it was forced, and it has become a murderer.So I, too, must
become a murderer, together with my nation.Upon whose shoulders
will I place the sin--upon the shoulders of our youths and
children?And if ever the Higher Conscience of the
world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting, if
it will call you and Maurice, my children, and will say to you:
"What have you done?I will come forward and
will say: "First you must judge me; I have also murdered--and
you know that I am an honest man!"_Pierre sits motionless, his face covered with his hands.Enter
Jeanne, unnoticed._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

But you must not die!EMIL GRELIEU

_Loudly, and with contempt._

Oh, death!Jeanne sits down and
speaks in the same tone of strange, almost cheerful calm._

JEANNE

Emil, she is here again.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes?JEANNE

She does not know herself.Emil, her dress and her hands were in
blood.EMIL GRELIEU

She is wounded?JEANNE

No, it is not her own blood, and by the color I could not tell
whose blood it is.PIERRE

Who is that, mother?I have combed her hair and
put a clean dress on her.Emil, I have
heard something--I understand that you want to go--?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

Together with your children, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the
ranks.JEANNE

You intend to go tomorrow?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

You cannot manage it today.Pierre, you have only an hour and a
half left._Silence._

PIERRE

Mamma!Tell him that he must not--Forgive me, father!--that he
should not go.He has given
to the nation his two sons--what more should he give?JEANNE

More, Pierre?PIERRE

Yes,--his life.You love him; you, yourself, would die if he
were killed--tell him that, mother!JEANNE

Yes, I love him.PIERRE

Oh, what are we, Maurice and I?Just as they have no
right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries, just as
they have no right to touch the eternal, so he--he--has no right
to die.I am speaking not as your son, no; but to kill Emil
Grelieu--that would be worse than to bum books.Listen to me!--although I
am young and should be silent--Listen to me!They have deprived us of our land and of the air;
they have destroyed our treasures which have been created
by the genius of our people, and now we would cast our best
men into their jaws!Let them kill us all, let our land be turned into a waste
desert, let all living creatures be burned to death, but as long
as he lives, Belgium is alive!Oh,
do not be silent, mother!_Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Somewhat sternly._

Calm yourself, Pierre!JEANNE

Yesterday I--no, Pierre, that isn't what I was going to say--I
don't know anything about it.But yesterday
I--it is hard to get vegetables, and even bread, here--so I went
to town, and for some reason we did not go in that direction,
but nearer the field of battle--.How strange it is that we
found ourselves there!And there I saw them coming--

EMIL GRELIEU

Whom?They were coming from there--where the battle
raged for four days.There were not many of them--about a
hundred or two hundred.But we all--there were so many people in
the streets--we all stepped back to the wall in order to make
way for them.Emil, just think of it; how strange!They did not
see us, and we would have been in their way!They were black
from smoke, from mud, from dried blood, and they were swaying
from fatigue.But that is
nothing, that is all nothing.They did not see their surroundings, they still reflected that
which they had seen there--fire and smoke and death--and what
else?Some one said: "Here are people returning from hell."We
all bowed to them, we bowed to them, but they did not see that
either.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, Jeanne, that is possible.PIERRE

And he will go to that inferno?Emil Grelieu walks over to his wife and kisses her
hand.Suddenly she rises._

JEANNE

Forgive me; there is something else I must say--

_She moves quickly and lightly, but suddenly, as though
stumbling over an invisible obstacle, falls on one knee.Then
she tries to rise, kneels, pale and still smiling, bending to
one side.They rush over to her and lift her from the ground._

PIERRE

Mamma!EMIL GRELIEU

You have a headache?Jeanne, my dearest, what ails you?_She pushes them aside, stands up firmly, trying to conceal her
nervousness._

JEANNE

What is it?My foot
slipped--you know, the one that pained me.EMIL GRELIEU

A glass of water, Pierre.Jeanne sits down, hangs her
head, as one guilty, endeavoring not to look into his eyes._

JEANNE

What an excitable youth--your Pierre!EMIL GRELIEU

_Significantly._

Jeanne!No, no--why do you look at me this way?_Pierre brings her water, but Jeanne does not drink it._

JEANNE

Thank you, Pierre, but I don't want it._Silence._

How fragrant the flowers are.Pierre, please give me that
rose--yes, that one.How fresh it is, Emil, and what
a fine fragrance--come over here, Emil!_Emil Grelieu goes over to her and kisses the hand in which she
holds the rose.Looks at her._

JEANNE

_Lowering her hand._

No; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance
seems to me immortal--it is always the same--as the sky.How
strange it is, always the same.And when you bring it close to
your face, and close to your eyes, it seems to you that there is
nothing except this red rose and the blue sky.Nothing but the
red rose and the distant, pale--very pale--blue sky....

EMIL GRELIEU

Pierre!People speak of this only at
night, when they are alone with their souls--and she knows it,
but you do not know it yet.JEANNE

_Trembling, opening her eyes._

Yes, I know, Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

The life of the poet does not belong to him.The roof over the
heads of people, which shelters them--all that is a phantom for
me, and my life does not belong to me.I am always far away, not
here--I am always where I am not.You think of finding me among
the living, while I am dead; you are afraid of finding me in
death, mute, cold, doomed to decay, while I live and sing aloud
from my grave.Death which makes people mute, which leaves the
imprint of silence upon the bravest lips, restores the voice
to the poet.Am I--just think of it, Pierre, my boy,--am I to fear
death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the
boundary between life and death, when in my feelings I mix life
and death into one--as two strong, rare kinds of wine?Emil Grelieu looks at his son, smiling.Pierre has
covered his face with his hands.She turns her eyes from her weeping son to her husband._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

Forgive me, father!JEANNE

Take this rose, Pierre, and when it fades and falls apart tear
down another rose--it will have the same fragrance as this one.You are a foolish little boy, Pierre, but I am also foolish,
although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently.Will you be
in the same regiment, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

No, hardly, Jeanne.PIERRE

Father, it is better that we be in the same regiment.I will
arrange it, father--will you permit me?And I will teach you how
to march--.You know, I am going to be your superior officer.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Very well.JEANNE

_Goes out singing in a low voice._

"Only the halo of the arts is crowning--law, liberty, and the
King."Look, Pierre, here is the girl you
wished to see.Come in, come in, my dear child!He is a very good man
and will do you no harm._A girl enters; she is frail, very pale, and beautiful.She
wears a black dress, her hair is combed neatly, and she is
modest in her demeanor.She
is followed by the chambermaid, Silvina, a kind, elderly woman
in a white cap; by Madame Henrietta, and another woman in the
service of the Grelieu household.They stop at the threshold
and watch the girl curiously.The elder woman is weeping as she
looks at her._

GIRL

_Stretching forth her hand to Pierre._

Oh, that is a soldier!Be so kind, soldier, tell me how to go to
Lonua.PIERRE

_Confused._

I do not know, Mademoiselle.GIRL

_Looking at everybody mournfully._

Who knows?JEANNE

_Cautiously and tenderly leading her to a seat._

Sit down, child, take a rest, my dear, give your poor feet a
rest.Pierre, her feet are wounded, yet she wants to walk all
the time.ELDERLY WOMAN

I wanted to stop her, Monsieur Pierre, but it is impossible to
stop her.If we close the door before her the poor girl beats
her head against the walls, like a bird in a cage.François enters from the garden and occupies
himself again with the flowers.He glances at the girl from time
to time.It is evident that he is making painful efforts to hear
and understand what is going on._

GIRL

It is time for me to go.JEANNE

Rest yourself, here, my child!At night it
is so terrible on the roads.There, in the dark air, bullets are
buzzing instead of our dear bees; there wicked people, vicious
beasts are roaming.And there is no one who can tell you, for
there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua.GIRL

Don't you know how I could find my way to Lonua?PIERRE

_Softly._

What is she asking?Emil GRELIEU

Oh, you may speak louder; she can hear as little as François.She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on
fire.Her home used to be there--now there are only ruins and
corpses there.There is no road that leads to Lonua!GIRL

Don't you know it, either?I have asked everybody,
and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua._She rises quickly and walks over to François._

Tell me; you are kindhearted!Don't you know the way to Lonua?_François looks at her intently.Silently he turns away and
walks out, stooping._

JEANNE

_Seating her again._

Sit down, little girl.GIRL

_Sadly._

I am asking, and they are silent.EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in
the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua.JEANNE

Her hands and her dress were bloodstained.I will hold you in my arms,
and you will feel better and more comfortable, my little child.GIRL

_Softly._

Tell me, how can I find my way to Lonua?JEANNE

Yes, yes, come!Emil, I will go with her to my room.Emil Grelieu and
Pierre remain._

EMIL GRELIEU

Lonua!A quiet little village which no one ever noticed
before--houses, trees, and flowers.Who knows
the way to that little village?Pierre, the soul of our people
is roaming about in the watches of the night, asking the dead
how to find the way to Lonua!Pierre, I cannot endure it any
longer!Oh, weep,
you German Nation--bitter will be the fate of your children,
terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free
nations!_Curtain_



SCENE III


_Night.The dark silhouette of Emil Grelieu's villa stands
out in the background.The gatekeeper's house is seen among
the trees, a dim light in the window.At the cast-iron fence
frightened women are huddled together, watching the fire in the
distance.An alarming redness has covered the sky; only in the
zenith is the sky dark.The reflection of the fire falls upon
objects and people, casting strange shadows against the mirrors
of the mute and dark villa.The voices sound muffled and timid;
there are frequent pauses and prolonged sighs.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!It is burning and burning,
and there is no end to the fire!SECOND WOMAN

Yesterday it was burning further away, and tonight the fire is
nearer.HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning, there is no end to the fire!Today
the sun was covered in a mist.SECOND WOMAN

It is forever burning, and the sun is growing ever darker!Now
it is lighter at night than in the daytime!SILVINA

I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Be silent, Silvina, be silent!_Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

I can't hear a sound.If I close my eyes
it seems to me that nothing is going on there.HENRIETTA

I can see all that is going on there even with my eyes closed.SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!SECOND WOMAN

Where is it burning?HENRIETTA

I don't know.It is burning and burning, and there is no end to
the fire!It may be that they have all perished by this time.It may be that something terrible is going on there, and we are
looking on and know nothing._A fourth woman approaches them quietly._

FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening!SILVINA

_With restraint._

Oh!HENRIETTA

Oh, you have frightened us!FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening, Madame Henrietta!Never mind my coming here--it
is terrible to stay in the house!I guessed that you were not
sleeping, but here, watching.And we can't hear a sound--how quiet!HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning.Haven't you heard anything about your
husband?FOURTH WOMAN

No, nothing.HENRIETTA

And with whom are your children just now?FOURTH WOMAN

Alone.Is it true that Monsieur Pierre was
killed?HENRIETTA

_Agitated._

Just imagine!I simply cannot understand what is
going on!You see, there is no one in the house now, and we are
afraid to sleep there--

SECOND WOMAN

The three of us sleep here, in the gatekeeper's house.HENRIETTA

I am afraid to look into that house even in the daytime--the
house is so large and so empty!And there are no men there, not
a soul--

FOURTH WOMAN

Is it true that François has gone to shoot the Prussians?Everybody is talking about it, but we don't know.He
disappeared quietly, like a mouse.FOURTH WOMAN

He will be hanged--the Prussians hang such people!HENRIETTA

Wait, wait!Today, while I was in the garden, I heard the
telephone ringing in the house; it was ringing for a long time.I was frightened, but I went in after all--and, just think of
it!Some one said: "Monsieur Pierre was killed!"SECOND WOMAN

And nothing more?HENRIETTA

Nothing more; not a word!I felt so bad
and was so frightened that I could hardly run out.Now I will
not enter that house for anything!FOURTH WOMAN

Whose voice was it?SECOND WOMAN

Madame Henrietta says it was an unfamiliar voice.HENRIETTA

Yes, an unfamiliar voice.There seems to be a light in the windows of the
house--somebody is there!SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Oh, what are you saying; what are you saying?SECOND WOMAN

That's from the redness of the sky!FOURTH WOMAN

What if some one is ringing there again?HENRIETTA

How is that possible?Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

What will become of us?They are coming this way, and there is
nothing that can stop them!FOURTH WOMAN

I wish I might die now!When you are dead, you don't hear or see
anything.HENRIETTA

It keeps on all night like this--it is burning and burning!And
in the daytime it will again be hard to see things on account of
the smoke; and the bread will smell of burning!FOURTH WOMAN

They have killed Monsieur Pierre.SECOND WOMAN

They have killed him?SILVINA

You must not speak of it!_Weeps softly._

FOURTH WOMAN

They say there are twenty millions of them, and they have
already set Paris on fire.They say they have cannon which can
hit a hundred kilometers away.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!SECOND WOMAN

Merciful God, have pity on us!FOURTH WOMAN

And they are flying and they are hurling bombs from
airships--terrible bombs, which destroy entire cities!HENRIETTA

My God!Before this You were
alone in the sky, and now those base Prussians are there too!SECOND WOMAN

Before this, when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the
sky, but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest
and joy!FOURTH WOMAN

They have taken everything away from our Belgium--even the sky!Don't you think that now my husband, my husband--

HENRIETTA

No, no!FOURTH WOMAN

Why is the sky so red?SECOND WOMAN

Have mercy on us, O God!The redness of the flames seems to be swaying over the
earth._

_Curtain_



SCENE IV


_Dawn.The sun has already risen, but it is hidden behind the
heavy mist and smoke._

_A large room in Emil Grelieu's villa, which has been turned
into a sickroom.There are two wounded there, Grelieu himself,
with a serious wound in his shoulder, and his son Maurice, with
a light wound on his right arm.The large window, covered with
half transparent curtains, admits a faint bluish light.In an armchair at the bedside of
Grelieu there is a motionless figure in white, Jeanne_.EMIL GRELIEU

_Softly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Shall I give you some water?EMIL GRELIEU

No.JEANNE

Oh, no, not at all.Can't you fall
asleep, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

What time is it?_She goes over to the window quietly, and pushing the curtain
aside slightly, looks at her little watch.Then she returns just
as quietly._

JEANNE

It is still early.Perhaps you will try to fall asleep, Emil?It
seems to me that you have been suffering great pain; you have
been groaning all night.EMIL GRELIEU

No, I am feeling better.JEANNE

Nasty weather, Emil; you can't see the sun.Suddenly Maurice utters a cry in his sleep; the cry
turns into a groan and indistinct mumbling.Jeanne walks over to
him and listens, then returns to her seat._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is the boy getting on well?JEANNE

Don't worry, Emil.He only said a few words in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

He has done it several times tonight.JEANNE

I am afraid that he is disturbing you.We can have him removed
to another room and Henrietta will stay with him.The boy's
blood is in good condition.In another week, I believe, we shall
be able to remove the bandage from his arm.EMIL GRELIEU

No, let him stay here, Jeanne.JEANNE

What is it, my dear?_She kneels at his bed and kisses his hand carefully._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

I think your fever has gone down, my dear._Impresses another kiss upon his hand and clings to it._

EMIL GRELIEU

You are my love, Jeanne.JEANNE

Do not speak, do not speak._A brief moment of silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Moving his head restlessly._

It is so hard to breathe here, the air----

JEANNE

The window has been open all night, my dear.There is not a
breeze outside.EMIL GRELIEU

There is smoke.MAURICE

_Utters a cry once more, then mutters_--

Stop, stop, stop!_Again indistinctly._

It is burning, it is burning!Who is going to the battery,
who is going to the battery----

_He mutters and then grows silent._

EMIL GRELIEU

What painful dreams!JEANNE

That's nothing; the boy always used to talk in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

What is it, my dear?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne.... Are you thinking about Pierre?_Silence._

JEANNE

_Softly._

Don't speak of him.EMIL GRELIEU

You are right.JEANNE

_After a brief pause._

That's true.EMIL GRELIEU

We shall follow him later.He will not come here, but we shall
go to him.Do you
remember the red rose which you gave him?EMIL GRELIEU

It is so clear.You are the best woman in
the world._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Tossing about in his bed._

It is so hard to breathe.JEANNE

My dear----

EMIL GRELIEU

No, that's nothing.Jeanne, was I
dreaming, or have I really heard cannonading?JEANNE

You really heard it, at about five o'clock.But very far away,
Emil--it was hardly audible.Close your eyes, my dear, rest
yourself._Silence_

MAURICE

_Faintly._

Mamma!_Jeanne walks over to him quietly._

JEANNE

Are you awake?JEANNE

He is awake.EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, Maurice.MAURICE

Good morning, papa.EMIL GRELIEU

I, too, am feeling well.Jeanne, you may draw the curtain aside.Still it will be easier for you to
breathe when it is light._She draws the curtain aside slowly, so as not to make it too
light at once.Beyond the large window vague silhouettes of the
trees are seen at the window frames and several withered, bent
flowers.Maurice is trying to adjust the screen._

JEANNE

What are you doing, Maurice?MAURICE

My coat--Never mind, I'll fix it myself._Guiltily._

No, mamma, you had better help me.JEANNE

_Going behind the screen._

What a foolish boy you are, Maurice._Behind the screen._

Be careful, be careful, that's the way.MAURICE

_Behind the screen._

Pin this for me right here, as you did yesterday.JEANNE

_Behind the screen._

Of course._Maurice comes out, his right arm dressed in a bandage.He goes
over to his father and first kisses his hand, then, upon a sign
from his eyes, he kisses him on the lips._

EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, good morning, my dear boy.MAURICE

_Looking around at the screen, where his mother is putting the
bed in order._

Papa, look!_He takes his hand out of the bandage and straightens it
quickly.Emil Grelieu
threatens him with his finger.Jeanne puts the screen aside, and
the bed is already in order._

JEANNE

I am through now.MAURICE

Oh, no; under no circumstances.Last
night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine._Walking over to the open window._

How nasty it is.These scoundrels have spoiled the day.Still,
it is warm and there is the smell of flowers.It's good, papa;
it is very fine.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, it is pleasant.MAURICE

Well, I am going.JEANNE

Clean your teeth; you didn't do it yesterday, Maurice._

What's the use of it now?_

Papa, do you know, well have good news today; I feel it._He is heard calling in a ringing voice, "Silvina."_

EMIL GRELIEU

I feel better.JEANNE

I'll let you have your coffee directly.You are looking much
better today, much better.EMIL GRELIEU

What is this?JEANNE

Perfume, with water.I'll bathe your face with it That's the
way.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

He didn't mean anything.He is very happy because he is a hero.EMIL GRELIEU

Do you know any news?JEANNE

_Irresolutely._

Nothing.EMIL GRELIEU

Tell me, Jeanne; you were firmer before.JEANNE

Was I firmer?Perhaps.... I have grown accustomed to talk to
you softly at night.Well--how shall I tell it to you?EMIL GRELIEU

Coming?Don't be excited, but I
think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are they near?JEANNE

Yes, they are near._Sings softly._

"Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté."I have not told you
that the King inquired yesterday about your health.I answered
that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Of course I am able to leave today.JEANNE

What did the King say?_Singing the same tune._

He said that their numbers were too great.EMIL GRELIEU

What else did he say?He said that there was a God and there was
righteousness.That's what I believe I heard him say--that there
was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence.But it is so good that they still
exist._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, in the daytime you are so different.Where do you get so
much strength, Jeanne?EMIL GRELIEU

I am forever looking at your hair.I am wondering why it hasn't
turned gray.JEANNE

I dye it at night, Emil.Oh, yes, I haven't told you yet--some one
will be here to see you today--Secretary Lagard and some one
else by the name of Count Clairmont.EMIL GRELIEU

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

It is not necessary that you should know him.He is simply known
as Count Clairmont, Count Clairmont--.That's a good name for a
very good man.EMIL GRELIEU

I know a very good man in Belgium--

JEANNE

Tsh!You must only remember--Count
Clairmont.They have some important matters to discuss with you,
I believe.And they'll send you an automobile, to take you to
Antwerp.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

_Also smiling._

Yes.You are loved by everybody, but if I were a King, I would
have sent you an aeroplane._Throwing back her hands in sorrow which she is trying vainly to
suppress._

Ah, how good it would be now to rise from the ground and
fly--and fly for a long, long time._Enter Maurice._

MAURICE

I am ready now, I have cleaned my teeth.I've even taken a walk
in the garden.But I have never before noticed that we have such
a beautiful garden!JEANNE

Coffee will be ready directly.If he disturbs you with his talk,
call me, Emil.MAURICE

Oh, I did not mean to disturb you.I'll not
disturb you any more.EMIL GRELIEU

You may speak, speak.JEANNE

But you must save your strength, don't forget that, Emil._Exit._

MAURICE

_Sitting down quietly at the window._

Perhaps I really ought not to speak, papa?EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling faintly._

Can you be silent?MAURICE

_Blushing._

No, father, I cannot just now.I suppose I seem to you very
young.EMIL GRELIEU

And what do you think of it yourself?MAURICE

_Blushing again._

I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago.Yes, only
three weeks ago--I remember the tolling of the bells in our
church, I remember how I teased François.How strange that
François has been lost and no one knows where he is.What does
it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.But need an old
man love his fatherland less than I love it, for instance?The
old people love it even more intensely.I am not tiring you, am I?An old man came to us, he was
very feeble, he asked for bullets--well, let them hang me too--I
gave him bullets.A few of our regiment made sport of him, but
he said: "If only one Prussian bullet will strike me, it means
that the Prussians will have one bullet less."EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that appeals to me, too.Have you heard the cannonading at
dawn?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Did mamma tell you that they are
coming nearer and nearer?MAURICE

_Rising._

Really?EMIL GRELIEU

They are coming, and we must leave for Antwerp today._He rises and walks back and forth, forgetting his wounded arm.Clenches his fist._

MAURICE

Father, tell me: What do you think of the present state of
affairs?EMIL GRELIEU

Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness.MAURICE

_Raising his hand._

Mamma says----Let God bless mamma!_His face twitches like a child's face.He is trying to repress
his tears._

MAURICE

I still owe them something for Pierre.Forgive me, father; I
don't know whether I have a right to say this or not, but I am
altogether different from you.It is wicked but I can't help it.I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I
felt so sorry--sorry for you, because you had grown them.EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice!MAURICE

The scoundrels!I don't want to consider them human beings, and
I shall not consider them human beings._Enter Jeanne._

JEANNE

What is it, Maurice?_As he passes he embraces his mother with his left hand and
kisses her._

JEANNE

You had better sit down.It is dangerous for your health to walk
around this way.EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down, Maurice._Maurice sits down at the window facing the garden.Emil Grelieu
smiles sadly and closes his eyes.Silvina, the maid, brings in
coffee and sets it on the table near Grelieu's bed._

SILVINA

Good morning, Monsieur Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

_Opening his eyes._

Good morning, Silvina._Exit Silvina._

JEANNE

Go and have your breakfast, Maurice.MAURICE

_Without turning around._

I don't want any breakfast.Mamma, I'll take off my bandage
tomorrow.JEANNE

_Laughing._

Soldier, is it possible that you are capricious?Jeanne helps Emil Grelieu with his coffee._

JEANNE

That's the way.Is it convenient for you this way, or do you
want to drink it with a spoon?EMIL GRELIEU

Oh, my poor head, it is so weak--

MAURICE

_Going over to him._

Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more.I was foolishly
excited, but do you know I could not endure it.May I have a
cup, mamma?JEANNE

Yes, this is yours.MAURICE

Yes, I do.EMIL GRELIEU

I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne.When is the bandage
to be changed?Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.MAURICE

Who is that, mamma?JEANNE

You'll see him.But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't
open your mouth so wide.You have a habit--you open your mouth
and then you forget about it.MAURICE

_Blushing._

You are both looking at me and smiling._The sound of automobiles is heard._

JEANNE

_Rising quickly._

I think they are here.Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont,
don't forget.They will speak with you
about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be
agitated.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I know.JEANNE

_Kissing him quickly._

I am going._Exit, almost colliding with Silvina, who is excited._

MAURICE

_Whispering._

Who is it, Silvina?_Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe.Maurice's
face assumes the same expression as Silvina's.Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to
his forehead, straightening himself in military fashion.Thus he
stands until the others notice him._

_Enter Jeanne, Count Clairmont, followed by Secretary Lagard and
the Count's adjudant, an elderly General of stem appearance,
with numerous decorations upon his chest.The Count himself
is tall, well built and young, in a modest officer's uniform,
without any medals to signify his high station.He carries
himself very modestly, almost bashfully, but overcoming his
first uneasiness, he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely.All treat him with profound respect._

_Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head.He speaks
simply, his gestures are calm and resolute.It is evident that
he is in the habit of speaking from a platform._

_Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands.Count
Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu's bedside._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Confused._

I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master.Oh, but
do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one,
otherwise I shall be very unhappy!EMIL GRELIEU

I am deeply moved, I am happy.COUNT CLAIRMONT

No, no, don't speak that way.Here stands before you only a man
who has learned to think from your books.But see what they have
done to you--look, Lagard!LAGARD

How are you, Grelieu?I, too, want to shake your hand.Today I
am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a
physician, and I may congratulate you--you have a kind hand.GENERAL

_Coming forward modestly._

Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to
express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!EMIL GRELIEU

I thank you.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?JEANNE

He can listen and talk, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Noticing Maurice, confused._

Oh!Please put down your hand--you are wounded.MAURICE

I am so happy, Count.JEANNE

This is our second son.Our first son, Pierre, was killed at
Liège--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu.Give me your hand,
Maurice.I dare not--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now.My children and my wife
have sent you flowers--but where are they?JEANNE

Here they are, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

Thank you.But I did not know that your flowers were better than
mine, for my flowers smell of smoke._To Count Clairmont._

His pulse is good.Grelieu, we have come to you not only to
express our sympathy.Through me all the working people of
Belgium are shaking your hand.EMIL GRELIEU

I am proud of it, Lagard.LAGARD

But we are just as proud.Yes; there is something we must
discuss with you.Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you,
but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him."EMIL GRELIEU

I am not dying.Maurice, I think you had better go out.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Quickly._

Oh, no, no.He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to
hear what his father will say.Oh, I should have been proud to
have such a father.LAGARD

Our Count is a very fine young man--Pardon me, Count, I have
again upset our--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it.Master,
it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are our affairs in such a critical condition?LAGARD

What is there to tell?That
horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea.Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.Daniel moved to the garden.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.Because they are

could not avoid the conclusion that this policy had failed.[1] He was really of Swiss extraction.{57}

CHAPTER VII

THE RUSSELL RESOLUTIONS

When the legislature of Lower Canada met in the autumn of 1836, Lord
Gosford earnestly called its attention to the estimates of the current
year and the accounts showing the arrears unpaid.Six months, however,
had passed by, and there was no sign of the redress of grievances.The
royal commission, indeed, had not completed its investigations.The
Assembly, therefore, refused once more to vote the necessary supplies.'In reference to the demand for a supply,' they told the governor,
'relying on the salutary maxim, that the correction of abuses and the
redress of grievances ought to precede the grant thereof, we have been
of opinion that there is nothing to authorize us to alter our
resolution of the last session.'This answer marked the final and indubitable breakdown of the policy of
conciliation without concession.This was recognized by {58} Gosford,
who soon afterwards wrote home asking to be allowed to resign, and
recommending the appointment of a governor whose hands were 'not
pledged as mine are to a mild and conciliatory line of policy.'Two alternatives were now open to the British ministers--either to make
a complete capitulation to the demands of the _Patriotes_, or to deal
with the situation in a high-handed way.They chose the latter course,
though with some hesitation and perhaps with regret.On March 6, 1837,
Lord John Russell, chancellor of the Exchequer in the Melbourne
administration and one of the most liberal-minded statesmen in England,
introduced into the House of Commons ten resolutions dealing with the
affairs of Canada.These resolutions recited that since 1832 no
provision had been made by the Assembly of Lower Canada for defraying
the charges for the administration of justice or for the support of the
civil government; that the attention of the Assembly had been called to
the arrears due; and that the Assembly had declined to vote a supply
until its demands for radical political changes were satisfied.The
resolutions declared that though both the bodies in question might be
improved in respect of their composition, it {59} was inadvisable to
grant the demand to make the Legislative Council elective, or to
subject the Executive Council to the responsibility demanded by the
House of Assembly.In regard to the financial question, the
resolutions repeated the offer made by Lord Aylmer and Lord
Gosford--namely, to hand over to the Assembly the control of the
hereditary, territorial, and casual revenues of the Crown, on condition
that the Assembly would grant a permanent civil list.But the main
feature of the resolutions was the clause empowering the governor to
pay out of the public revenues, without authorization of the Assembly,
the moneys necessary for defraying the cost of government in the
province up to April 10, 1837.This, though not exactly a suspension
of the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within
the competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the
claim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive
government, through the power of the purse or otherwise.A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these
resolutions.Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part
in the discussion.Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the
Irish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians.Doubtless
it seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were
victims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry.Sir George Grey, the
colleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and
William Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support
of the resolutions.The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of
the Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were
comparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by
overwhelming majorities.From a print in the Chateau de Ramezay.]As soon as the passage of the resolutions became known in Canada,
Papineau and his friends began to set the heather on fire.On May 7,
1837, the _Patriotes_ held a huge open-air meeting at St Ours, eleven
miles above Sorel on the river Richelieu.The chief organizer of the
meeting was Dr Wolfred Nelson, a member of the Assembly living in the
neighbouring village of St Denis, who was destined to be one of the
leaders of the revolt at the end of the year.Papineau himself was
present at the meeting and he spoke in his usual violent strain.He
submitted a resolution declaring that 'we cannot but {61} consider a
government which has recourse to injustice, to force, and to a
violation of the social contract, anything else than an oppressive
government, a government by force, for which the measure of our
submission should henceforth be simply the measure of our numerical
strength, in combination with the sympathy we may find elsewhere.'At
St Laurent a week later he used language no less dangerous.'The
Russell resolutions,' he cried, 'are a foul stain; the people should
not, and will not, submit to them; the people must transmit their just
rights to their posterity, even though it cost them their property and
their lives to do so.'All over the
province the _Patriotes_ met together to protest against what they
called 'coercion.'As a rule the meetings were held in the country
parishes after church on Sunday, when the habitants were gathered
together.Most inflammatory language was used, and flags and placards
were displayed bearing such devices as '_Papineau et le systeme
electif_,' '_Papineau et l'independence_,' and '_A bas le despotisme_.'Alarmed by such language, Lord Gosford issued on June 15 a proclamation
calling on all loyal {62} subjects to discountenance writings of a
seditious tendency, and to avoid meetings of a turbulent or political
character.But the proclamation produced no abatement in the
agitation; it merely offered one more subject for denunciation.During this period Papineau and his friends continually drew their
inspiration from the procedure of the Whigs in the American colonies
before 1776.The resolutions of the _Patriotes_ recalled the language
of the Declaration of Independence.One of the first measures of the
Americans had been to boycott English goods; one of the first measures
of the _Patriotes_ was a resolution passed at St Ours binding them to
forswear the use of imported English goods and to use only the products
of Canadian industry.At the short and abortive session of the
legislature which took place at the end of the summer of 1837, nearly
all the members of the Assembly appeared in clothes made of Canadian
frieze.The shifts of some of the members to avoid wearing English
imported articles were rather amusing.'Mr Rodier's dress,' said the
Quebec _Mercury_, 'excited the greatest attention, being unique with
the exception of a pair of Berlin gloves, viz.: frock coat of {63}
granite colored _etoffe du pays_; inexpressibles and vest of the same
material, striped blue and white; straw hat, and beef shoes, with a
pair of home-made socks, completed the _outre_ attire.Mr Rodier, it
was remarked, had no shirt on, having doubtless been unable to smuggle
or manufacture one.'But Louis LaFontaine and 'Beau' Viger limited
their patriotism, it appears, to the wearing of Canadian-made
waistcoats.The imitation of the American revolutionists did not end
here.If the New England colonies had their 'Sons of Liberty,' Lower
Canada had its '_Fils de la Liberte_'--an association formed in
Montreal in the autumn of 1837.And the Lower Canada Patriotes
outstripped the New England patriots in the republican character of
their utterances.'Our only hope,' announced _La Minerve_, 'is to
elect our governor ourselves, or, in other words, to cease to belong to
the British Empire.'A manifesto of some of the younger spirits of the
_Patriote_ party, issued on October 1, 1837, spoke of 'proud designs,
which in our day must emancipate our beloved country from all human
authority except that of the bold democracy residing within its bosom.'To add point to these opinions, there sprang up all over the country
{64} volunteer companies of armed _Patriotes_, led and organized by
militia officers who had been dismissed for seditious utterances.Naturally, this situation caused much concern among the loyal people of
the country.Loyalist meetings were held in Quebec and Montreal, to
offset the _Patriote_ meetings; and an attempt was made to form a
loyalist rifle corps in Montreal.The attempt failed owing to the
opposition of the governor, who was afraid that such a step would
merely aggravate the situation.Not even Gosford, however, was blind
to the seriousness of the situation.He wrote to the colonial
secretary on September 2, 1837, that all hope of conciliation had
passed.Papineau's aims were now the separation of Canada from England
and the establishment of a republican form of government.'I am
disposed to think,' he concluded, 'that you may be under the necessity
of suspending the constitution.'It was at this time that the Church first threw its weight openly
against the revolutionary movement.The British government had
accorded to Catholics in Canada a measure of liberty at once just and
generous; and the bishops and clergy were not slow to see that under a
republican form of government, {65} whether as a state in the American
Union or as an independent _nation canadienne_, they might be much
worse off, and would not be any better off, than under the dominion of
Great Britain.In the summer of 1837 Mgr Lartigue, the bishop of
Montreal, addressed a communication to the clergy of his diocese asking
them to keep the people within the path of duty.In October he
followed this up by a Pastoral Letter, to be read in all the churches,
warning the people against the sin of rebellion.He held over those
who contemplated rebellion the penalties of the Church: 'The present
question amounts to nothing less than this--whether you will choose to
maintain, or whether you will choose to abandon, the laws of your
religion.'The ecclesiastical authorities were roused to action by a great meeting
held on October 23, at St Charles on the Richelieu, the largest and
most imposing of all the meetings thus far.Five or six thousand
people attended it, representing all the counties about the Richelieu.Dr Wolfred Nelson was in the
chair, but Papineau was the central figure.A company of armed men,
headed by two militia officers who had been dismissed for disloyalty,
and {66} drawn up as a guard, saluted every resolution of the meeting
with a volley.A wooden pillar, with a cap of liberty on top, was
erected, and dedicated to Papineau.At the end of the proceedings
Papineau was led up to the column to receive an address.After this
all present marched past singing popular airs; and each man placed his
hand on the column, swearing to be faithful to the cause of his
country, and to conquer or die for her.All this, of course, was
comparatively innocent.The resolutions, too, were not more violent
than many others which had been passed elsewhere.Nor did Papineau use
language more extreme than usual.Many of the _Patriotes_, indeed,
considered his speech too moderate.He deprecated any recourse to arms
and advised his hearers merely to boycott English goods, in order to
bring the government to righteousness.But some of his lieutenants
used language which seemed dangerous.Roused by the eloquence of their
leader, they went further than he would venture, and advocated an
appeal to the arbitrament of war.'The time has come,' cried Wolfred
Nelson, 'to melt our spoons into bullets.'The exact attitude of Papineau during {67} these months of agitation is
difficult to determine.He does not seem to have been quite clear as
to what course he should pursue.He had completely lost faith in
British justice.He earnestly desired the emancipation of Canada from
British rule and the establishment of a republican system of
government.But he could not make up his mind to commit himself to
armed rebellion.'I must say, however,' he had announced at St
Laurent, 'and it is neither fear nor scruple that makes me do so, that
the day has not yet come for us to respond to that appeal.'The same
attitude is apparent, in spite of the haughty and defiant language, in
the letter which he addressed to the governor's secretary in answer to
an inquiry as to what he had said at St Laurent:


SIR,--The pretension of the governor to interrogate me respecting my
conduct at St Laurent on the 15th of May last is an impertinence which
I repel with contempt and silence.I, however, take the pen merely to tell the governor that it is false
that any of the resolutions adopted at the meeting of the county of
Montreal, held at St Laurent {68} on the 15th May last, recommend a
violation of the laws, as in his ignorance he may believe, or as he at
least asserts.--Your obedient servant,

L. J. PAPINEAU.At St Charles Papineau was even more precise in repudiating revolution;
and there is no evidence that, when rebellion was decided upon,
Papineau played any important part in laying the plans.In later years
he was always emphatic in denying that the rebellion of 1837 had been
primarily his handiwork.'I was,' he said in 1847, 'neither more nor
less guilty, nor more nor less deserving, than a great number of my
colleagues.'The truth seems to be that Papineau always balked a
little at the idea of armed rebellion, and that he was carried off his
feet at the end of 1837 by his younger associates, whose enthusiasm he
himself had inspired.He had raised the wind, but he could not ride
the whirlwind.[Illustration: South-Western Lower Canada, 1837.]{69}

CHAPTER VIII

THE DOGS OF WAR

As the autumn of 1837 wore on, the situation in Lower Canada began to
assume an aspect more and more threatening.In spite of a proclamation
from the governor forbidding such meetings, the _Patriotes_ continued
to gather for military drill and musketry exercises.Armed bands went
about the countryside, in many places intimidating the loyalists and
forcing loyal magistrates and militia officers to send in their
resignations to the governor.As early as July some of the Scottish
settlers at Cote St Joseph, near St Eustache, had fled from their
homes, leaving their property to its fate.Several houses at Cote St
Mary had been fired upon or broken into.A letter of Sir John
Colborne, the commander of the forces in British North America, written
on October 6, shows what the state of affairs was at that time:


In my correspondence with Col.Eden I have had occasion to refer to the
facts {70} and reports that establish the decided character which the
agitators have lately assumed.The people have elected the dismissed
officers of the militia to command them.At St Ours a pole has been
erected in favour of a dismissed captain with this inscription on it,
'Elu par le peuple.'At St Hyacinthe the tri-coloured flag was
displayed for several days.Two families have quitted the town in
consequence of the annoyance they received from the patriots.Wolfred
Nelson warned the patriots at a public meeting to be ready to arm.The
tri-coloured flag is to be seen at two taverns between St Denis and St
Charles.Many of the tavern-keepers have discontinued their signs and
substituted for them an eagle.The bank notes or promissory notes
issued at Yamaska have also the same emblem marked on them.Mr
Papineau was escorted from Yamaska to St Denis by a numerous retinue,
and it is said that 200 or 300 carriages accompanied him on his route.He has attended five public meetings lately; and at one of them La
Valtrie, a priest, was insulted in his presence.The occurrence at St
Denis was certainly {71} a political affair, a family at St Antoine
opposed to the proceedings of W. Nelson, having been annoyed by the
same mob that destroyed the house of Madame St Jacques a few hours
before the shot was fired from her window.Special animosity was shown toward the Chouayens, those French
Canadians who had refused to follow Papineau's lead.P. D. Debartzch,
a legislative councillor and a former supporter of Papineau, who had
withdrawn his support after the passing of the Ninety-Two Resolutions,
was obliged to flee from his home at St Charles; and Dr Quesnel, one of
the magistrates of L'Acadie, had his house broken into by a mob that
demanded his resignation as magistrate.On November 6 rioting broke out in Montreal.The Doric Club, an
organization of the young men of English blood in the city, came into
conflict with the French-Canadian _Fils de la Liberte_.Which side
provoked the hostilities, it is now difficult to say.Certainly, both
sides were to blame for their behaviour during the day.The sons of
liberty broke the windows of prominent loyalists; and the members of
the Doric Club completely wrecked {72} the office of the _Vindicator_
newspaper.It was only when the Riot Act was read, and the troops were
called out, that the rioting ceased.Up to this point the _Patriotes_ had not indulged in any overt acts of
armed rebellion.Some of their leaders, it is true, had been laying
plans for a revolt.So much is known from the correspondence which
passed between the leading _Patriotes_ in Lower Canada and William Lyon
Mackenzie, the leader of the rebellion in Upper Canada.Thomas Storrow
Brown, one of Papineau's lieutenants, wrote to Mackenzie asking him to
start the ball rolling in Upper Canada first, in order to draw off some
of the troops which Sir John Colborne had massed in Lower Canada.But
all calculations were now upset by events which rapidly precipitated
the crisis in the lower province.Soon after the fracas in the streets of Montreal between the Doric Club
and the _Fils de la Liberte_, a priest named Quibilier waited on
Papineau, and advised him, since his presence in Montreal had become a
source of disturbance, to leave the city.Whether he came as an
emissary from the ecclesiastical authorities or merely as a friend is
not clear.At any rate, Papineau accepted his advice, {73} and
immediately set out for St Hyacinthe.The government, thinking that Papineau had left the city for the
purpose of stirring up trouble in the Richelieu district, promptly
issued warrants for the arrest of Papineau and some of his chief
lieutenants, Dr Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Edmund Bailey
O'Callaghan, and several others.Meanwhile, on the day that these warrants for arrest were being issued
(November 16), a skirmish took place between a small party of British
troopers and a band of _Patriotes_ on the road between Chambly and
Longueuil--a skirmish which may be described as the Lexington of the
Lower Canada rebellion.The troopers, under Lieutenant Ermatinger, had
been sent to St Johns to arrest two French Canadians, named Demaray and
Davignon, who had been intimidating the magistrates.The arrest had
been effected, and the party were on their way back to Montreal, when
they were confronted by an armed company of _Patriotes_, under the
command of Bonaventure Viger, who demanded the release of the
prisoners.A brisk skirmish ensued, in which several on both sides
were wounded.The troopers, outnumbered by at least five {74} to one,
and having nothing but pistols with which to reply to the fire of
muskets and fowling-pieces, were easily routed; and the two prisoners
were liberated.The news of this affair spread rapidly through the parishes, and
greatly encouraged the _Patriotes_ to resist the arrest of Papineau and
his lieutenants.Papineau, Nelson, Brown, and O'Callaghan had all
evaded the sheriff's officer, and had taken refuge in the country about
the Richelieu, the heart of the revolutionary district.In a day or
two word came to Montreal that considerable numbers of armed habitants
had gathered at the villages of St Denis and St Charles, evidently with
the intention of preventing the arrest of their leaders.The force at
St Denis was under the command of Wolfred Nelson, and that at St
Charles was under the command of Thomas Storrow Brown.How these
self-styled 'generals' came to be appointed is somewhat of a mystery.Brown, at any rate, seems to have been chosen for the position on the
spur of the moment.'A mere accident took me to St Charles,' he wrote
afterwards, 'and put me at the head of a revolting force.'Sir John Colborne, who was in command of the British military forces,
immediately {75} determined to disperse these gatherings by force and
to arrest their leaders.A force
consisting of one regiment of infantry, a troop of the Montreal
Volunteer Cavalry, and two light field-guns, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, had already been dispatched to Chambly by
way of the road on which the rescue of Demaray and Davignon had taken
place.Another force,
consisting of five companies of the 24th regiment, with a
twelve-pounder, under Colonel Charles Gore, a Waterloo veteran, would
proceed by boat to Sorel.There it was to be joined by one company of
the 66th regiment, then in garrison at Sorel, and the combined force
would march on St Denis.After having dispersed the rebels at St
Denis, which was thought not to be strongly held, the little army was
to proceed to St Charles, where it would be joined by the force under
Wetherall.At eight o'clock on the evening of November 22, Colonel Gore set out
with his men from the barrack-square at Sorel for St Denis.The
journey was one of eighteen miles; and in order to avoid St Ours, which
was held by the _Patriotes_, Gore turned away from the main {76} road
along the Richelieu to make a detour.This led his troops over very
bad roads.The night was dark and rain poured down in torrents.'I
got a lantern,' wrote one of Gore's aides-de-camp afterwards, 'fastened
it to the top of a pole, and had it carried in front of the column; but
what with horses and men sinking in the mud, harness breaking, wading
through water and winding through woods, the little force soon got
separated, those in the rear lost sight of the light, and great delays
and difficulties were experienced.Towards morning the rain changed to
snow, it became very cold, and daybreak found the unfortunate column
still floundering in the half-frozen mud four miles from St Denis.'Meanwhile word had reached the rebels of the coming of the soldiers.At daybreak Dr Wolfred Nelson had ridden out to reconnoitre, and had
succeeded in destroying several bridges.As the soldiers approached St
Denis they heard the church bells ringing the alarm; and it was not
long before they found that the village was strongly defended.After
capturing some of the houses on the outskirts of the village, they were
halted by a stockade built across the road covered by a large brick
house, well fortified on all sides.The commander of {77} the troops
brought reinforcements up to the firing line, and the twelve-pounder
came into action.But the assailants made very little impression on
the defence.Although the engagement lasted for more than five hours,
the troops succeeded in capturing nothing more than one of the flanking
houses.The ammunition of the British was running low, and the numbers
of the insurgents seemed to be increasing.Colonel Gore therefore
deemed it advisable to retire.By some strange oversight the British
were without any ambulance or transport of any kind; and they were
compelled to leave their dead and wounded behind them.Their
casualties were six killed and eighteen wounded.The wounded, it is a
pleasure to be able to say, were well looked after by the victorious
_Patriotes_.The British effected their retreat with great steadiness, despite the
fact that the men had had no food since the previous day and had been
marching all night.They were compelled to abandon their
twelve-pounder in the mud; but they reached St Ours that night without
further loss.The next day they were back at Sorel.The number of the insurgents at St Denis has never been accurately
ascertained; {78} probably they were considerably in excess of the
troops.Their position was one of great strength, and good judgment
had been shown in fortifying it.On the other hand, with the exception
of a few veterans of Major de Salaberry's Voltigeurs, they were
untrained in war; and their muskets and fowling-pieces were much
inferior to the rifles of the regulars.Their victory, it must be
said, reflected great credit upon them; although their losses had been
twice as great as those of the soldiers,[1] these peasants in homespun
had stood their ground with a courage and steadiness which would have
honoured old campaigners.The same, unfortunately, cannot be said
about some of their leaders.Papineau and O'Callaghan were present in
St Denis when the attack began; but before the morning was well
advanced, they had departed for St Hyacinthe, whence they later fled to
the United States.Papineau always declared that he had taken this
action at the {79} solicitation of Wolfred Nelson, who had said to him:
'Do not expose yourself uselessly: you will be of more service to us
after the fight than here.'In later days, however, when political
differences had arisen between the two men, Nelson denied having given
Papineau any such advice.But
even if Nelson did advise Papineau to leave, it cannot be said that
Papineau consulted his own reputation in accepting the advice.He was
not a person without military experience: he had been a major in the
militia, and was probably superior in rank to any one in the village.His place was with the brave farmers who had taken up arms on his
behalf.An episode in connection with the attack on St Denis left a dark stain
on the _Patriote_ escutcheon and embittered greatly the relations
between the two races in Canada.This was the murder, on the morning
of the fight, of Lieutenant Weir, a subaltern in the 32nd regiment, who
had been sent with dispatches to Sorel by land.He had reached Sorel
half an hour after Colonel Gore and his men had departed for St Denis.In attempting to catch up with Gore's column he had taken the direct
road to St Denis and had arrived there {80} in advance of the British
troops.On approaching the village he was arrested, and by Wolfred
Nelson's orders placed in detention.As the British attack developed,
it was thought better by those who had him in charge to remove him to
St Charles.They bound him tightly and placed him in a wagon.Hardly
had they started when he made an attempt to escape.In this emergency
his warders seem to have lost their heads.In spite of the fact that
Weir was tightly bound and could do no harm, they fell upon him with
swords and pistols, and in a short time dispatched him.Then, appalled
at what they had done, they attempted to hide the body.When the
British troops entered St Denis a week later, they found the body
lying, weighted down with stones, in the Richelieu river under about
two feet of water.The autopsy disclosed the brutality with which Weir
had been murdered; and the sight of the body so infuriated the soldiers
that they gave the greater part of the village of St Denis to the
flames.In the later phases of the rebellion the slogan of the British
soldiers was, 'Remember Jack Weir.'Another atrocious murder even more unpardonable than that of Weir was
perpetrated {81} a few days later.On November 28 some _Patriotes_
near St Johns captured a man by the name of Chartrand, who was enlisted
in a loyal volunteer corps of the district.After a mock trial
Chartrand was tied to a tree and shot by his own countrymen.[1] According to a report twelve _Patriotes_ lost their lives during
the engagement.Among them was Charles Ovide Perrault, member of the
Assembly for Vaudreuil, a young barrister of considerable promise.He
seems to have been Papineau's closest follower and confidant During the
last sessions of the Lower Canada legislature Perrault contributed many
letters to _La Minerve_.{82}

CHAPTER IX

_FORCE MAJEURE_

The check administered to Colonel Gore's column at St Denis, in the
first engagement of the rebellion, was the only victory which fell to
the rebel forces.In the meantime Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, with
several companies of infantry, a troop of volunteer cavalry, and two
field-guns, was marching on St Charles.On the evening of November 22
Major Gugy, the leader of the English party in the Assembly, had
brought to Wetherall at Chambly instructions to advance down the
Richelieu and attack the rebel position at St Charles in the morning.He set out accordingly at about the hour when Gore headed his forces up
the river from Sorel.But, while Gore carried out his orders to the
letter and reached St Denis on the morning of the 23rd, Wetherall
allowed himself some latitude in interpreting his instructions.This
was largely due to the advice of Gugy, if we are to believe {83} the
account which Gugy has left us.'In the first place,' it runs, 'not
one of the force knew anything of the roads or people, nor do I believe
that more than one spoke French....  The storm raged so fearfully, the
rain poured in such torrents, and the frost set in afterwards so
intensely, that... men and horses were equally fatigued... all so
exhausted as to be unable to cope, on broken or woody ground,
successfully with any resolute enemy....  I learned that we had marched
without a dollar, without a loaf of bread, without a commissary, and
without a spare cartridge--a pretty predicament in an enemy's country,
surrounded by thousands of armed men.'It was apparent to Gugy that
Sir John Colborne, in issuing his orders, had greatly underestimated
the difficulty of the task he was setting for the troops.After
crossing the river above the Chambly Basin, Gugy therefore induced
Wetherall to halt until daylight; and, turning himself into a
commissary, he billeted the men and horses in the neighbouring houses
and stables.The next day about noon the column reached St Hilaire, some seven miles
from St Charles.Here Wetherall obtained information which led him to
fear that Gore {84} had met with some kind of check; and he was
persuaded to send back to Chambly for a reinforcement of one company
which had been left in garrison there.His messenger reached Chambly
at four o'clock on the morning of the 24th.Major Warde, the
commandant at Chambly, at once embarked his company on a scow and
dropped down the river to St Hilaire; but he arrived too late to allow
of any further action that day, and it was not until the morning of the
25th that the column moved on St Charles.Meanwhile, the rebels had been making preparations for defence.They
had fortified the manor-house of Debartzch, who had fled to Montreal,
and built round it a rampart of earth and tree-trunks--a rampart which,
for some mysterious reason, was never completed.They appointed as
commander Thomas Storrow Brown, a Montreal iron-merchant, for whose
arrest a warrant had been issued and who had fled to St Charles with
two or three other _Patriote_ politicians.But Brown had no military
experience, and was still suffering so severely from injuries received
in the rioting in Montreal that his proper place was a home for
convalescents rather than a field of battle.His appointment can only
be {85} explained by the non-appearance of the local _Patriote_
leaders.'The chief men,' Brown testified afterwards, 'were, with two
or three exceptions, absent or hiding.'It is evident that the British
authorities expected to meet with the strongest opposition at St
Charles, since that place had been the scene of the great demonstration
earlier in the year.But, as a matter of fact, the rebel forces at St
Charles were much less formidable than those at St Denis.Not only
were they lacking in proper military leadership; they were also fewer
in number and were, moreover, very inadequately armed.If Brown's
statements are to be relied upon, there were not in the rebel camp two
hundred men.'Of ammunition,' wrote Brown, 'we had some half dozen
kegs of gunpowder and a little lead, which was cast into bullets; but
as the fire-arms were of every calibre, the cartridges made were too
large for many, which were consequently useless.We had two small
rusty field-pieces, but with neither carriages nor appointments they
were as useless as two logs.There was one old musket, but not a
bayonet.The fire-arms were common flintlocks, in all conditions of
dilapidation, some tied together with string, and very many with {86}
lock-springs so worn out that they could not be discharged.'On the 24th Brown made a reconnaissance in the direction of St Hilaire.He destroyed a bridge over a ravine some distance to the south of St
Charles, and placed above it an outpost with orders to prevent a
reconstruction of the bridge.But when the British troops appeared on
the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back
without making any resistance.They probably saw that they were so
outnumbered that resistance would be hopeless.On the approach of the
troops Brown at first assumed an attitude of confidence.A messenger
came from Wetherall, 'a respectable old habitant,' to tell the rebels
that if they dispersed quietly, they would not be molested.Brown
treated the message as a confession of weakness.'I at once supposed,'
he said, 'that, followed in the rear by our friends from above, they
were seeking a free passage to Sorel, and determined to send a message,
that _if they would lay down their arms, they should pass unmolested_.'This message does not seem to have reached its destination.And hardly
had the engagement opened when Brown quickly changed his tune.'To go
forward {87} was useless, as I could order nothing but a
retreat--without it the people commenced retiring.I tried to rally
the little squads, my only hope being in keeping together the
fowling-pieces we had collected, but finding, after a long trial, my
strength and authority insufficient, I considered my command gone,
turned my horse, and rode to... St Denis (seven or eight miles), where
... I arrived about nightfall.'The rebels, or at any rate
those of them who were armed, seem to have been outnumbered by the
soldiers, of whom there were between three and four hundred.But the
fighting was apparently brisk while it lasted.The British lost three
killed and eighteen wounded.The _Patriote_ losses are not known.The
local tradition is that forty-two were killed and many more wounded.We know that thirty were taken prisoners on the field.The defeat of the rebels at St Charles really terminated the rebellion
in the country about the Richelieu.When news of the defeat spread
over the countryside, the _Patriote_ forces immediately disbanded, and
their leaders sought safety in flight.Papineau and O'Callaghan, who
had been at St Hyacinthe, {88} succeeded in getting across the Vermont
border; but Wolfred Nelson was not so fortunate.After suffering great
privations he was captured by some loyalist militia not far from the
frontier, taken to Montreal, and there lodged in prison.For some reason which it is difficult to discern, Wetherall did not
march on from St Charles to effect a pacification of St Denis.On
December 1, however, Colonel Gore once more set out from Sorel, and
entered St Denis the same day.He
recovered the howitzer and five of the wounded men he had left behind.In spite of the absence of opposition, his men took advantage of the
occasion to wreak an unfair and un-British vengeance on the helpless
victors of yesterday.Goaded to fury by the sight of young Weir's
mangled body, they set fire to a large part of the village.Colonel
Gore afterwards repudiated the charge that he had ordered the burning
of the houses of the insurgents; but that defence does not absolve him
from blame.It is obvious, at any rate, that he did not take adequate
measures to prevent such excesses; nor was any punishment ever
administered to those who applied the torch.{89}

But the end of rebellion was not yet in sight.Two more encounters
remain to be described.The first of these occurred at a place known
as Moore's Corners, near the Vermont border.After the collapse at St
Charles a number of _Patriote_ refugees had gathered at the small town
of Swanton, a few miles south of Missisquoi Bay, on the American side
of the boundary-line.Among them were Dr Cyrile Cote and Edouard
Rodier, both members of the Lower Canada Assembly; Ludger Duvernay, a
member of the Assembly and editor of _La Minerve_; Dr Kimber, one of
the ringleaders in the rescue of Demaray and Davignon; and Robert Shore
Milnes Bouchette, the descendant of a French-Canadian family long
conspicuous for its loyalty and its services to the state.Bouchette's
grandfather had been instrumental in effecting the escape of Sir Guy
Carleton from Montreal in 1775, when that place was threatened by the
forces of Montgomery.The grandson's social tastes and affiliations
might have led one to expect that he would have been found in the ranks
of the loyalists; but the arbitrary policy of the Russell Resolutions
had driven him into the arms of the extreme _Patriotes_.Arrested for
disloyalty at the outbreak of {90} the rebellion, he had been admitted
to bail and had escaped.These men, under the belief that the
habitants would rise and join them, determined upon an armed invasion
of Canada.Possibly they believed also that Wolfred Nelson was still
holding out.Papineau, it was said, had reported that 'the victor of
St Denis' was entrenched with a considerable force at St Cesaire on the
Yamaska.They therefore collected arms and ammunition, sent emissaries
through the parishes to the north to rouse the _Patriotes_, and on
December 6, flying some colours which had been worked for them by the
enthusiastic ladies of Swanton, they crossed the Canadian border, about
two hundred strong.They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets
and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on
Canadian soil.Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at
Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command
of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and
ammunition.Having received warning of the coming of the insurgents,
Kemp had sent out messengers through the countryside to rouse the
loyalist {91} population.To these as they arrived he served out the
muskets in his wagons.And when the rebels appeared, about eight
o'clock at night, he had a force at his disposal of at least three
hundred men, all well armed.There is reason for believing that Kemp might have succeeded in
ambushing the advancing force, had not some of his men, untrained
volunteers with muskets in their hands for the first time, opened fire
prematurely.The rebels returned the fire, and a fusillade continued
for ten or fifteen minutes.But the rebels, on perceiving that they
had met a superior force, retired in great haste, leaving behind them
one dead and two wounded.One of the wounded was Bouchette, who had
been in command of the advance-guard.The rebels abandoned also their
two field-pieces, about forty stand of arms, five kegs of gunpowder,
and six boxes of ball-cartridge, as well as two standards.Among the
loyalists there were no casualties whatever.Only three of the rebels
were taken prisoner besides the two wounded, a fact which Kemp
explained by several factors--the undisciplined state of the loyalists,
the darkness of the night, the vicinity of woods, and the proximity of
the boundary-line, {92} beyond which he did not allow the pursuit to
go.The 'battle' of Moore's Corners was in truth an excellent farce;
but there is no doubt that it prevented what might have been a more
serious encounter had the rebel column reached the neighbourhood of St
Johns, where many of the _Patriotes_ were in readiness to join them.A few days later, in a part of the province some distance removed from
the Richelieu river and the Vermont border, there occurred another
collision, perhaps the most formidable of the whole rebellion.This
was at the village of St Eustache, in the county of Two Mountains,
about eighteen miles north-west of Montreal.The county of Two
Mountains had long been known as a stronghold of the extreme
_Patriotes_.The local member, W. H. Scott, was a supporter of
Papineau, and had a large and enthusiastic following.He was not,
however, a leader in the troubles that ensued.The chief organizer of
revolt in St Eustache and the surrounding country was a mysterious
adventurer named Amury Girod, who arrived in St Eustache toward the end
of November with credentials, it would seem from Papineau, assigning to
him the task of superintending the _Patriote_ cause {93} in the north.He is variously described as having
been a Swiss, an Alsatian, and a native of Louisiana.According to his
own statement, he had been at one time a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry
in Mexico.He was well educated, could speak fluently several
languages, had a bold and plausible manner, and succeeded in imposing,
not only upon the _Patriote_ leaders, but upon the people of St
Eustache.He found a capable and dauntless supporter in Dr J. O.
Chenier, the young physician of the village.Chenier was one of the
few leaders of the revolt whose courage challenges admiration; and it
is fitting that to-day a monument, bearing the simple inscription
CHENIER, should stand in the Place Viger in Montreal, among the people
for whom, though misguidedly and recklessly, he laid down his life.To St Eustache, on Sunday, November 26, came the news of Wolfred
Nelson's victory at St Denis.On Monday and Tuesday bands of
_Patriotes_ went about the countryside, terrorizing and disarming the
loyalists and compelling the faint-hearted to join in the rising.On
Wednesday night the rebels gathered to the number of about four hundred
{94} in St Eustache, and got noisily drunk (_s'y enivrerent
bruyamment_).They then proceeded, under the command of Girod and
Chenier, to the Indian mission settlement at the Lake of Two Mountains.Here they broke into the government stores and possessed themselves of
some guns and ammunition.They next made themselves unwelcome to the
superior of the mission, the Abbe Dufresne, and, in spite of his
protestations, carried off from the mission-house a three-pounder gun.On their return to St Eustache they forcibly entered the convent which
had been lately completed, though it was not yet occupied, and camped
there.The loyalists who were forced to flee from the village carried the news
of these proceedings to Montreal; but Sir John Colborne was unwilling
to take any steps to subdue the _Patriotes_ of St Eustache until the
insurrection on the Richelieu had been thoroughly crushed.All he did
was to send a detachment of volunteers to guard the Bord a Plouffe
bridge at the northern end of the island of Montreal.On Sunday, December 3, word reached St Eustache of the defeat of the
insurgents at St Charles.This had a moderating influence on many of
the _Patriotes_.All week the Abbe {95} Paquin, parish priest of St
Eustache, had been urging the insurgents to go back quietly to their
homes.He begged Chenier to cease
his revolutionary conduct.Chenier, however, was immovable.He
refused to believe that the rebels at St Charles had been dispersed,
and announced his determination to die with arms in his hands rather
than surrender.'You might as well try to seize the moon with your
teeth,' he exclaimed, 'as to try to shake my resolve.'The events of the days that followed cannot be chronicled in detail.When the Abbe Paquin and his vicar Deseves sought to leave the parish,
Girod and Chenier virtually placed them under arrest.The abbe did not
mince matters with Chenier.'I accuse you before God and man,' he
said, 'of being the author of these misfortunes.'When some of the
habitants came to him complaining that they had been forced against
their will to join the rebels, he reminded them of the English proverb:
'You may lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.'Unfortunately, the Abbe Paquin's good influence was counteracted by
that of the Abbe Chartier, the cure of the neighbouring village of St
{96} Benoit, a rare case of an ecclesiastic lending his support to the
rebel movement, in direct contravention of the orders of his superiors.On several occasions the Abbe Chartier came over to St Eustache and
delivered inflammatory addresses to the rebel levies.The vicar Deseves has left us a vivid picture of the life which the
rebels led.No attempt was made to drill them or to exercise
discipline.He continually saw them,
he says, passing through the village in knots of five or six, carrying
rusty guns out of order, smoking short black pipes, and wearing blue
_tuques_ which hung half-way down their backs, clothes of _etoffe du
pays_, and leather mittens.They helped themselves to all the strong
drink they could lay their hands on, and their gait showed the
influence of their potations.Their chief aim in life seemed to be to
steal, to drink, to eat, to dance, and to quarrel.With regard to the
morrow, they lived in a fool's paradise.They seem to have believed
that the troops would not dare to come out to meet them, and that when
their leaders should give the word they would advance on Montreal and
take it without difficulty.Their numbers during this period showed a
good deal of {97} fluctuation.Ultimately Girod succeeded in gathering
about him nearly a thousand men.Not all these, however, were armed;
according to Deseves a great many of them had no weapons but sticks and
stones.By December 13 Sir John Colborne was ready to move.He had provided
himself with a force strong enough to crush an enemy several times more
numerous than the insurgents led by Girod and Chenier.His column was
composed of the 1st Royals, the 32nd regiment, the 83rd regiment, the
Montreal Volunteer Rifles, Globensky and Leclerc's Volunteers, a strong
force of cavalry--in all, over two thousand men, supported by eight
pieces of field artillery and well supplied with provision and
ammunition transport.The troops bivouacked for the night at St Martin, and advanced on the
morning of the 14th.The main body crossed the Mille Isles river on
the ice about four miles to the east of St Eustache, and then moved
westward along the St Rose road.A detachment of Globensky's
Volunteers, however, followed the direct road to St Eustache, and came
out on the south side of the river opposite the village, in full view
of the rebels.Chenier, at the head of a hundred and fifty men,
crossed the {98} ice, and was on the point of coming to close quarters
with the volunteers when the main body of the loyalists appeared to the
east.Thereupon Chenier and his men beat a hasty retreat, and made
hurried preparations for defending the village.The church, the
convent, the presbytery, and the house of the member of the Assembly,
Scott, were all occupied and barricaded.It was about the church that
the fiercest fighting took place.The artillery was brought to bear on
the building; but the stout masonry resisted the battering of the
cannon balls, and is still standing, dinted and scarred.Some of the
Royals then got into the presbytery and set fire to it.Under cover of
the smoke the rest of the regiment then doubled up the street to the
church door.Gaining access through the sacristy, they lit a fire
behind the altar.'The firing from the church windows then ceased,'
wrote one of the officers afterwards, 'and the rebels began running out
from some low windows, apparently of a crypt or cellar.Our men formed
up on one side of the church, and the 32nd and 83rd on the other.Some
of the rebels ran out and fired at the troops, then threw down their
arms and begged for quarter.Our officers tried to save the {99}
Canadians, but the men shouted "Remember Jack Weir," and numbers of
these poor deluded fellows were shot down.'He had jumped from a window of the
Blessed Virgin's chapel and was making for the cemetery.How many fell
with him it is difficult to say.It was said that seventy rebels were
killed, and a number of charred bodies were found afterwards in the
ruins of the church.The casualties among the troops were slight, one
killed and nine wounded.One of the wounded was Major Gugy, who here
distinguished himself by his bravery and kind-heartedness, as he had
done in the St Charles expedition.A good
many, indeed, had fled from the village on the first appearance of the
troops.Among these were some who had played a conspicuous part in
fomenting trouble.The Abbe Chartier of St Benoit, instead of waiting
to administer the last rites to the dying, beat a feverish retreat and
eventually escaped to the United States.The Church placed on him its
interdict, and he never again set foot on Canadian soil.The behaviour
of the adventurer Girod, the 'general' of the rebel force, was
especially {100} reprehensible.When he had posted his men in the
church and the surrounding buildings, he mounted a horse and fled
toward St Benoit.At a tavern where he stopped to get a stiff draught
of spirits he announced that the rebels had been victorious and that he
was seeking reinforcements with which to crush the troops completely.Then, finding that the cordon was
tightening around him, he blew out his brains with a revolver.Thus
ended a life which was not without its share of romance and mystery.On the night of the 14th the troops encamped near the desolate village
of St Eustache, a large part of which had unfortunately been given over
to the flames during the engagement.In the morning the column set out
for St Benoit.Sir John Colborne had threatened that if a single shot
were fired from St Benoit the village would be given over to fire and
pillage.But when the troops arrived there they found awaiting them
about two hundred and fifty men bearing white flags.All the villagers
laid down their arms and made an unqualified submission.And it is a
matter for profound regret that, notwithstanding this, the greater part
of the village {101} was burned to the ground.Sir John Colborne has
been severely censured for this occurrence, and not without reason.Nothing is more certain, of course, than that he did not order it.It
seems to have been the work of the loyalist volunteers, who had without
doubt suffered much at the hands of the rebels.'The irregular troops
employed,' wrote one of the British officers, 'were not to be
controlled, and were in every case, I believe, the instrument of the
infliction.'Far too much burning and pillaging went on, indeed, in
the wake of the rebellion.'You know,' wrote an inhabitant of St
Benoit to a friend in Montreal, 'where the younger Arnoldi got his
supply of butter, or where another got the guitar he carried back with
him from the expedition about the neck.'And it is probable that the
British officers, and perhaps Sir John Colborne himself, winked at some
things which they could not officially recognize.At any rate, it is
impossible to acquit Colborne of all responsibility for the unsoldierly
conduct of the men under his command.It is usual to regard the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada as no less
a fiasco than its counterpart in Upper Canada.There is no doubt that
it was hopeless from the outset.{102} It was an impromptu movement,
based upon a sudden resolution rather than on a well-reasoned plan of
action.Most of the leaders--Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown,
Robert Bouchette, and Amury Girod--were strangers to the men under
their command; and none of them, save Chenier, seemed disposed to fight
to the last ditch.The movement at its inception fell under the
official ban of the Church; and only two priests, the cures of St
Charles and St Benoit, showed it any encouragement.The actual
rebellion was confined to the county of Two Mountains and the valley of
the Richelieu.The districts of Quebec and Three Rivers were quiet as
the grave--with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional village like
Montmagny, where Etienne P. Tache, afterwards a colleague of Sir John
Macdonald and prime minister of Canada, was the centre of a local
agitation.Yet it is easy to see that the rebellion might have been
much more serious.But for the loyal attitude of the ecclesiastical
authorities, and the efforts of many clear-headed parish priests like
the Abbe Paquin of St Eustache, the revolutionary leaders might have
been able to consummate their plans, and Sir John Colborne, with the
small number of troops at {103} his disposal, might have found it
difficult to keep the flag flying.The rebellion was easily snuffed
out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to
the voice of their Church, set their faces against it.{104}

CHAPTER X

THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER

The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public
opinion in the mother country.That the first year of the reign of the
young Queen Victoria should have been marred by an armed revolt in an
important British colony shocked the sensibilities of Englishmen and
forced the country and the government to realize that the grievances of
the Canadian Reformers were more serious than they had imagined.It
was clear that the old system of alternating concession and repression
had broken down and that the situation demanded radical action.The
Melbourne government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada for
three years, and appointed the Earl of Durham as Lord High
Commissioner, with very full powers, to go out to Canada to investigate
the grievances and to report on a remedy.John George Lambton, the first Earl of {105} Durham, was a wealthy and
powerful Whig nobleman, of decided Liberal, if not Radical, leanings.He had taken no small part in the framing of the Reform Bill of 1832,
and at one time he had been hailed by the English Radicals or Chartists
as their coming leader.It was therefore expected that he would be
decently sympathetic with the Reform movements in the Canadas.At the
same time, Melbourne and his ministers were only too glad to ship him
out of the country.There was no question of his great ability and
statesmanlike outlook.But his advanced Radical views were distasteful
to many of his former colleagues; and his arrogant manners, his lack of
tact, and his love of pomp and circumstance made him unpopular even in
his own party.The truth is that he was an excellent leader to work
under, but a bad colleague to work with.The Melbourne government had
first got rid of him by sending him to St Petersburg as ambassador
extraordinary; and then, on his return from St Petersburg, they got him
out of the way by sending him to Canada.He was at first loath to go,
mainly on the ground of ill health; but at the personal intercession of
the young queen he accepted the commission offered him.It was {106}
an evil day for himself, but a good day for Canada, when he did so.Durham arrived in Quebec, with an almost regal retinue, on May 28,
1838.Gosford, who had remained in Canada throughout the rebellion,
had gone home at the end of February; and the administration had been
taken over by Sir John Colborne, the commander-in-chief of the forces.As soon as the news of the suspension of the constitution reached Lower
Canada, Sir John Colborne appointed a provisional special council of
twenty-two members, half of them French and half of them English, to
administer the affairs of the province until Lord Durham should arrive.The first official act of Lord Durham in the colony swept this council
out of existence.'His Excellency believes,' the members of the
council were told, 'that it is as much the interest of you all, as for
the advantage of his own mission, that his administrative conduct
should be free from all suspicions of political influence or party
feeling; that it should rest on his own undivided responsibility, and
that when he quits the Province, he should leave none of its permanent
residents in any way committed by the acts which his Government may
have {107} found it necessary to perform, during the temporary
suspension of the Constitution.'In its place he appointed a small
council of five members, all but one from his own staff.The one
Canadian called to this council was Dominick Daly, the provincial
secretary, whom Colborne recommended as being unidentified with any
political party.The first great problem with which Lord Durham and his council had to
deal was the question of the political prisoners, numbers of whom were
still lying in the prisons of Montreal.Sir John Colborne had not
attempted to decide what should be done with them, preferring to shift
this responsibility upon Lord Durham.It would probably have been much
better to have settled the matter before Lord Durham set foot in the
colony, so that his mission might not have been handicapped at the
outset with so thorny a problem; but it is easy to follow Colborne's
reasoning.In the first place, he did not bring the prisoners to trial
because no Lower-Canadian jury at that time could have been induced to
convict them, a reasonable inference from the fact that the murder of
Weir had gone unavenged, even as the murderers of Chartrand were to be
acquitted {108} by a jury a few months later.In the second place,
Colborne had not the power to deal with the prisoners summarily.Moreover, most of the rebel leaders had not been captured.The only
three prisoners of much importance were Wolfred Nelson, Robert
Bouchette, and Bonaventure Viger.The rest of the _Patriote_ leaders
were scattered far and wide.Chenier and Girod lay beneath the
springing sod; Papineau, O'Callaghan, Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson,
Cote, and Rodier were across the American border; Morin had just come
out of his hiding-place in the Canadian backwoods; and LaFontaine,
after vainly endeavouring, on the outbreak of rebellion, to get Gosford
to call together the legislature of Lower Canada, had gone abroad.The
future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still
doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further
disturbances.And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne
thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by
Durham.Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy.His own
instincts were apparently in favour of a complete amnesty; but he
supposed it necessary to make an {109} example of some of the leaders.After earnest deliberation and consultation with his council, and
especially with his chief secretary, Charles Buller, the friend and
pupil of Thomas Carlyle, Durham determined to grant to the rebels a
general amnesty, with only twenty-four exceptions.Eight of the men
excepted were political prisoners who had been prominent in the revolt
and who had confessed their guilt and had thrown themselves on the
mercy of the Lord High Commissioner; the remaining sixteen were rebel
leaders who had fled from the country.Durham gave orders that the
eight prisoners should be transported to the Bermudas during the
queen's pleasure.The sixteen refugees were forbidden to return to
Canada under penalty of death without benefit of clergy.No one can fail to see that this course was dictated by the humanest
considerations.A criminal rebellion had terminated without the
shedding judicially of a drop of blood.Lord Durham even took care
that the eight prisoners should not be sent to a convict colony.The
only criticism directed against his course in Canada was on the ground
of its excessive lenity.Wolfred Nelson and Robert Bouchette had
certainly suffered a milder fate {110} than that of Samuel Lount and
Peter Matthews, who had been hanged in Upper Canada for rebellion.Yet
when the news of Durham's action reached England, it was immediately
attacked as arbitrary and unconstitutional.The assault was opened by
Lord Brougham, a bitter personal enemy of Lord Durham.In the House of
Lords Brougham contended that Durham had had no right to pass sentence
on the rebel prisoners and refugees when they had not been brought to
trial; and that he had no right to order them to be transported to, and
held in, Bermuda, where his authority did not run.In this attitude he
was supported by the Duke of Wellington, the leader of the Tory party.Wellington's name is one which is usually remembered with honour in the
history of the British Empire; but on this occasion he did not think it
beneath him to play fast and loose with the interests of Canada for the
sake of a paltry party advantage.It would have been easy for him to
recognize the humanity of Durham's policy, and to join with the
government in legislating away any technical illegalities that may have
existed in Durham's ordinance; but Wellington could not resist the
temptation to embarrass the Whig {111} administration, regardless of
the injury which he might be doing to the sorely tried people of Canada.The Melbourne administration, which had sent Durham to Canada, might
have been expected to stand behind him when he was attacked.Lord John
Russell, indeed, rose in the House of Commons and made a thoroughgoing
defence of Durham's policy as 'wise and statesmanlike.'But he alone
of the ministers gave Durham loyal support.In the House of Lords
Melbourne contented himself with a feeble defence of Durham and then
capitulated to the Opposition.Nothing would have been easier for him
than to introduce a bill making valid whatever may have been irregular
in Durham's ordinance; but instead of that he disallowed the ordinance,
and passed an Act of Indemnity for all those who had had a part in
carrying it out.Without waiting to hear Durham's defence, or to
consult with him as to the course which should be followed, the Cabinet
weakly surrendered to an attack of his personal enemies.Durham was
betrayed in the house of his friends.The news of the disallowance of the ordinance first reached Durham
through the columns of an American newspaper.{112} Immediately his
mind was made up.Without waiting for any official notification, he
sent in his resignation to the colonial secretary.He was quite
satisfied himself that he had not exceeded his powers.'Until I
learn,' he wrote, 'from some one better versed in the English language
that despotism means anything but such an aggregation of the supreme
executive and legislative authority in a single head, as was
deliberately made by Parliament in the Act which constituted my powers,
I shall not blush to hear that I have exercised a despotism; I shall
feel anxious only to know how well and wisely I have used, or rather
exhibited an intention of using, my great powers.'But he felt that if
he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his
usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him.He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had
completed the inquiries he had instituted.In view of the 'lamentable
want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the
Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself
if he left his inquiry incomplete.'A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under
ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a
proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation,
and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to
Canadian public opinion.It was this proclamation which drew down on
him from _The Times_ the nickname of 'Lord High Seditioner.'The
wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended
by Charles Duller.The general unpopularity of the British government,
Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could
not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the
angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with
whom they could agree.The real justification of the proclamation lay
in the magical effect which it had upon the public temper.The news
that the ordinance had been disallowed, and that the whole question of
the political prisoners had been once more thrown into the melting-pot,
had greatly excited the public mind; and the proclamation fell like oil
upon the troubled waters.'No disorder, no increase of disaffection
ensued; on the contrary, all parties in the Province expressed a
revival of confidence.'Lord Durham left Quebec on November 1, {114} 1838.'It was a sad day
and a sad departure,' wrote Buller.The
spectators filled every window and every house-top, and, though every
hat was raised as we passed, a deep silence marked the general grief
for Lord Durham's departure.'Durham had been in Canada only five
short months.Yet in that time he had gained a knowledge of, and an
insight into, the Canadian situation such as no other governor of
Canada had possessed.The permanent monument of that insight is, of
course, his famous _Report on the Affairs of British North America_,
issued by the Colonial Office in 1839.This is no place to write at
length about that greatest of all documents ever published with regard
to colonial affairs.In the _Report_
Lord Durham rightly diagnosed the evils of the body politic in Canada.He traced the rebellion to two causes, in the main: first, racial
feeling; and, secondly, that 'union of representative and irresponsible
government' of which he said that it was difficult to understand how
any English statesman ever imagined that such a system would work.And
yet one of the two chief remedies which he recommended seemed like a
death sentence passed on the French in Canada.{115} This was the
proposal for the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada with the
avowed object of anglicizing by absorption the French population.This
suggestion certainly did not promote racial peace.The other proposal,
that of granting to the Canadian people responsible government in all
matters not infringing'strictly imperial interests,' blazed the trail
leading out of the swamps of pre-rebellion politics.In one respect only is Lord Durham's _Report_ seriously faulty: it is
not fair to French Canadians.'They cling,' wrote Durham, 'to ancient
prejudices, ancient customs, and ancient laws, not from any strong
sense of their beneficial effects, but with the unreasoning tenacity of
an uneducated and unprogressive people.'To their racial and
nationalist ambitions he was far from favourable.'The error,' he
contended, 'to which the present contest is to be attributed is the
vain endeavour to preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the midst
of Anglo-American colonies and states'; and he quoted with seeming
approval the statement of one of the Lower Canada 'Bureaucrats' that
'Lower Canada must be _English_, at the expense, if necessary, of not
being _British_.'His primary {116} object in recommending the union
of the two Canadas, to place the French in a minority in the united
province, was surely a mistaken policy.Lord Elgin, a far wiser statesman, who completed Durham's
work by introducing the substance of responsible government which the
_Report_ recommended, decidedly opposed anything in the nature of a
gradual crusade against French-Canadian nationalism.'I for one,' he
wrote, 'am deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to
denationalize the French.Generally speaking, they produce the
opposite effect, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity
to burn more fiercely.But suppose them to be successful, what would
be the result?You may perhaps _Americanize_, but, depend upon it, by
methods of this description you will never _Anglicize_ the French
inhabitants of the province.Let them feel, on the other hand, that
their religion, their habits, their prepossessions, their prejudices if
you will, are more considered and respected here than in other portions
of this vast continent, and who will venture to say that the last hand
which waves the British flag on American ground may not be that of a
French Canadian?'{117}

CHAPTER XI

THE SECOND REBELLION

The frigate _Inconstant_, with Lord Durham on board, was not two days
out from Quebec when rebellion broke out anew in Lower Canada.This
second rebellion, however, was not caused by Lord Durham's departure,
but was the result of a long course of agitation which had been carried
on along the American border throughout the months of Lord Durham's
regime.As early as February 1838 numbers of Canadian refugees had gathered in
the towns on the American side of the boundary-line in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain.They were shown much sympathy and
encouragement by the Americans, and seem to have laboured under the
delusion that the American government would come to their assistance.A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson,
declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional
government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member.The identity of the other members is a mystery.Papineau seems to have
had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the
idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off
negotiations.'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and
this through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and
inveterate love of the old French bad laws.'There is reason to
believe, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the
authorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and
Cote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was
not ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality.On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border
with an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small
field-pieces.Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and
a junction with another invading force at Three Rivers.But on finding
their way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty
retreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by
the American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer
who had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston
Heights in 1812.During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay
plans for an insurrection in Lower Canada.Emissaries had been
constantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont
frontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the
United States.And when November
came large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St
Charles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois.They had
apparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these
places by American sympathizers with arms and supplies.No such aid
being found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes.But some
persevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their
backs to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line,
which had been designated as the rebel headquarters.Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the
American side of the border with a small band of refugees.{120} Among
these were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had
been inveigled into joining the expedition.Hindenlang, who afterwards
paid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of
what happened.He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west
side of Lake Champlain.With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had
been placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the
river to the Canadian border.There were five in the party--Nelson and
the two French officers, the guide, and the boatman.Nelson had given
Hindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would
be greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic
recruits.'There was not a
single man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional
Government_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much
trouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the
arms.'On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville.Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three
hundred men.A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was
proclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.'Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great
astonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force
was that of brigadier-general.The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of
reinforcements and in gathering arms.By the 7th Nelson had collected
a force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in
companies and divisions.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks
and pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to
obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of
Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow
had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result
that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the
attack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men
south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and
ammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote
encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at
Lacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met
with greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in
the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a
brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove
them from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the
border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as
well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used
in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of
ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two
were killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of
communications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the
same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on
Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and
volunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on
Odelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand
men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived
at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about
two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting
field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no
difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself
proved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force
at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by
means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three
days before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to
the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from
behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;
'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,
praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many
saints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the
fighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men
had been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement
lasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church
made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were
beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the
Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The
rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch
and rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were
serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many
wounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and
one officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable
force, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were
still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of
troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported
to be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,
where a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight
resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry
volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of
Royal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,
did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

     By Oscar D. Skelton.You have again rendered me important service, Fred.How I wish you could
take up with that offer I made you.""That is what I have come for, General, if you will accept my poor
services."Fred, and then replied: "I have no home; my father has cast me
out.""I had my choice to accompany him in the Confederate army or to go to
Europe to attend some university.Nelson knitted his brows a moment as if in thought, and then replied:
"You were certainly right in refusing the first; I wonder at your father
making you the proposition.The last was a very reasonable proposition,
and a wise one.I am afraid I am to blame
for your folly--for such it is.The offer I made you appealed to your
boyish imagination and love of adventure, and caused you to go against
the wishes of your father.Four or five years at some foreign university
is a chance not to be idly thrown away, to say nothing about obeying the
wishes of your father.As much as I would like your services, Fred, be
reconciled to your father; go to Europe, and keep out of this infernal
war.It will cost the lives of thousands of just such noble youths as
you before it ends; and," he continued, with a tinge of sadness in his
tone, "I sometimes think I shall never live to see it end.I am
surrounded by hundreds of enemies who are hungering for my life.""Your advice, General, is most kindly given," answered Fred, "and I
sincerely thank you for what you have said; but it is impossible for me
to accept it.He gave me
$1,000 and my horse, and told me to go my way.I love my father, but if
I should now go back after what has passed, he would despise me, as I
would despise myself.Father is the soul of honor; if I should play the
craven after all that I have said, he would not only despise, but loathe
me.Now I can hope that time may once more unite us.Be assured that
though his heart may be filled with anger towards me now, if I prove
myself worthy, he will yet be proud of his son."He grasped Fred's hand, and exclaimed with
much feeling: "You must have a noble father, or he could not have such a
son.Consider yourself attached to my staff
as confidential scout and messenger.I do not wish you to enlist; you
will be more free to act if you are not an enlisted soldier."Fred warmly thanked the general for his expression of confidence, and
announced himself as ready for orders.Nelson smiled at his ardor, and then said: "I believe you stated that
that meeting is to take place in Scott county the 17th?"How would you like to go
there, and see what you can learn?""I can make it all right, but I am afraid some of
them may know me.""We will fix that all right," responded Nelson.The next morning, a boy with jet black hair and hands and face stained
brown rode away from General Nelson's headquarters.It would have been
a close observer indeed that would have taken that boy for Fred
Shackelford.It was on the evening of the 16th that Fred reached Georgetown.He found
the little city full of excited partisans of the South.At the meeting
the next day many fierce speeches were made.The extremists were for at
once calling out the State Guards, and marching on Camp Dick Robinson,
and capturing it at the point of the bayonet.Governor Magoffin was instructed to protest in the strongest
language to President Lincoln, and to call on him at once to disband the
troops at Dick Robinson.As for allowing the arms to be shipped, it was
resolved that it should be prevented at all hazards.When Fred arrived at Georgetown, he found at the hotel that he could
procure a room next to the one occupied by Major Hockoday, and believing
that the major's room might be used for secret consultations of the more
violent partisans of the South, he engaged it, hoping that in some
manner he might become possessed of some of their secrets.While the
room engaged by Major Hockoday was unoccupied he deftly made a hole
through the plastering in his room, and then with the aid of a sharpened
stick made a very small opening through the plastering into the next
room.He then rolled up a sheet of paper in the shape of a trumpet.By
placing the small end of the paper in the small opening, and putting his
ear to the larger end, he was enabled to hear much that was said,
especially if everything was still and the conversation was animated.The result exceeded his most sanguine expectations.After the close of
the public meeting, a number of the more prominent actors gathered in
Major Hockoday's room.A heated discussion arose as to how Kentucky could the most quickly
throw off her neutrality, and join her fortune to that of the
Confederacy."Gentlemen," said Major Hockoday, "I believe every one present is a true
son of the South, therefore I can speak to you freely.The first thing,
as we all agree, is to prevent the shipment of these arms.Then if
Lincoln refuses to disband the troops at Dick Robinson, the program is
this: You all know that General Buckner has been in Washington for some
time talking neutrality.In a measure he has gained the confidence of
Lincoln, and has nearly received the promise that no Federal troops from
other States will be ordered into the State as long as the Confederate
troops keep out.Buckner has secretly gone to Richmond, where he will
accept a commission from the Confederate government.He will then come
back by way of the South, and issue a proclamation to loyal Kentuckians
to join his standard.The State Guards should join him to a man.Then,
if Lincoln refuses to disband the soldiers at Dick Robinson, the
Confederate government will occupy the State with troops, claiming and
justly, too, that the Federal government has not respected the
neutrality of the State.The coming of the Confederate troops will fire
the heart of every true Kentuckian, and all over the State Confederates
will spring to arms, and the half-armed ragamuffins of Nelson will be
scattered like a flock of sheep.By a dash Louisville can be occupied,
and Kentucky will be where she belongs--in the Southern Confederacy.What think you, gentlemen, of the program?"Strong men embraced each other
with tears streaming down their cheeks.They believed with their whole
hearts and souls that the South was right, and that Kentucky's place was
with her Southern sisters, and now that there seemed to be a possibility
of this, their enthusiasm knew no bounds.As for Fred, he drew a long breath.He knew that he had gained
information of the greatest value to the Federal cause."It is time for me to be going," he said to himself."Nelson must know
of this as soon as possible."As he passed out of the room, he came face to face with Major Hockoday.The major stared at him a moment, and then roughly asked: "What is your
name, and what are you doing here?""I see no reason why I should report to you," replied Fred."I am a
guest at this hotel, and am minding my own business.I wish I could say
as much for you," and he walked away.The major looked after him, his face red with anger, and muttered:
"Strange!but if that boy didn't have black hair and was not dark, I
should swear it was Fred Shackelford.But a gentleman came along just then and engaged him in conversation.As
soon as he could disengage himself, the major examined the hotel
register to find who occupied room 13.Opposite that number he found
written in a bold, boyish hand:

"F. Carrington....Fred's full name was Fred Carrington Shackelford, and he had registered
his given names only.Major Hockoday made careful inquiry about the boy,
but no one knew him.He had paid his bill, called for his horse, and
rode away.Major Hockoday was troubled,
why he hardly knew; but somehow he felt as if the presence of that
black-haired boy boded no good to their cause.All of this time Fred was riding swiftly towards Lexington.General Nelson listened to his report not only with attention, but with
astonishment."Fred," said he, "you are a marvel; you are worth a brigade of soldiers.I have been reporting all the time to the authorities at Washington that
Buckner was heart and soul with the South; but they wouldn't believe me.Neither will they believe me now, but I can act on your information.""Fred," continued the general, walking rapidly up and down the room, "I
sometimes think there is a set of dunderheads at Washington.They think
they know everything, and don't know anything.If Kentucky is saved, it
will be saved by the loyal men of the State.Just think of their
listening to Buckner instead of me," and the general worked himself into
a violent rage, and it took him some time to cool off.Then he said: "I
will try once more to hurry up those arms.I will send you to-morrow to
Cincinnati as a special messenger.I will write what you have told me,
and I want you to impress it on General Anderson's mind.Tell him to
hurry, hurry, or it will be too late."The next morning Fred was on his way back to Nicholasville.From there
he took the train for Cincinnati, at which place he arrived in due time.He delivered his dispatches to General Anderson, who, after reading
them, looked at him kindly and said:

"General Nelson sends a young messenger, but he tells me of the great
service you have performed and the valuable information you have
gathered.It is certainly wonderful for so young a boy.Fred modestly related what had occurred at Georgetown.General Anderson listened attentively, and when Fred had finished, said:
"You certainly deserve the credit General Nelson has given you.The
information you received is of the greatest importance, and will be at
once forwarded to Washington.In the mean time, we must do the best we
can.General Nelson may think I am slow, but there is so much to do--so
much to do, and so little to do with," and the general sighed.Fred
observed him with interest, for he realized that he was talking to the
hero who had defended Fort Sumter to the last.The general was broken in health, and looked sick and careworn, and not
the man to assume the great burden he was bearing.It was with joy that
Fred heard that the arms would be shipped in a day or two.But when the
train carrying them was ready to start, Fred saw, to his amazement, that
it was not to be guarded."That train will never get through," he thought."It is funny how they
do things."Fred was right; the enemies of the government were not idle.Spies were
all around, and they knew when the train was to start to a minute, and
the news was flashed ahead.At a small station in Harrison county the
train was stopped by a large mob, who tore up the track in front, making
it impossible for it to proceed.There was nothing to do but to take the
train back to Cincinnati, and with it a communication to the officials
of the road that if they attempted to run the train again the whole
track would be torn up from Covington to Lexington.The railway officials, thoroughly frightened, begged General Anderson
not to attempt to run the train again.The Southern sympathizers were
jubilant over their success, and boldly declared the arms would never be
shipped.As for Fred, he was completely disgusted, and expressed himself so."Well, my boy, what would you do?""I would send a regiment and a
battery on a train ahead of the one carrying the arms, and if the mob
interfered I would sweep them from the face of the earth.""Well said, my lad," replied Anderson, his face lighting up and his eyes
kindling."I feel that way myself, but a soldier must obey orders, and
unfortunately I have different orders.""I have orders to load them on a steamboat, and send them up the
Kentucky River to Hickman Bridge.""You don't seem pleased," said the general.blurted out Fred; "excuse me, General, but it is all
foolishness.The boat will be
stopped the same as the train."The general turned away, but Fred heard him say, as if to himself: "I am
afraid it will be so, but the government persists in tying our hands as
far as Kentucky is concerned."General Anderson's position was certainly an anomalous one--the
commander of a department, and yet not allowed to move troops into it.According to his orders, Fred took passage on the boat with the arms,
but he felt it would never be permitted to reach its destination.When the boat reached the confines of Owen
county they found a great mob congregated on the banks of the river.was the cry, "or we will burn the boat."The
captain tried to parley, but he was met with curses and jeers.Fred went on shore, and mingling with the mob, soon learned there was a
conspiracy on the part of the more daring to burn the boat, even if it
did turn back.Hurrying on board, Fred told the captain his only
salvation was to turn back at once, and to put on all steam.He did so,
and the boat and cargo were saved.Once more the Confederate sympathizers went wild with rejoicing, and the
Union men were correspondingly depressed.But the boat made an unexpected move, as far as the enemy were
concerned.Instead of proceeding back to Cincinnati, it turned down the
Ohio to Louisville.Here the arms were hastily loaded on the cars, and
started for Lexington.Fred was hurried on ahead to apprise General
Nelson of their coming.Fred delivered his message to the general, and
then said: "The train will never get through; it will be stopped at
Lexington, if not before.""If the train ever reaches Lexington I will have the arms," grimly
replied Nelson."Lexington is in my jurisdiction; there will be no
fooling, no parleying with traitors, if the train reaches that city."Then he turned to Colonel Thomas E. Bramlette, and said: "Colonel, take
a squadron of cavalry, proceed to Lexington, and when that train comes,
take charge of it and guard it to Nicholasville.I will have wagons
there to transport the arms here."Colonel Bramlette saluted, and replied: "General, I will return with
those arms or not at all.""Certainly, if you wish," answered Nelson."You have stayed by the arms
so far, and it is no more than right that you should be in at the
finish."The enemy was alert, and the news reached Lexington that the train
loaded with the arms and ammunition for the soldiers at Dick Robinson
was coming.Instantly the little city was aflame with excitement.The State Guards
under the command of John H. Morgan gathered at their armory with the
avowed intention of seizing the train by force.John C. Breckinridge
made a speech to the excited citizens, saying the train must be stopped,
if blood flowed.In the midst of this excitement Colonel Bramlette with his cavalry
arrived."Drive the Lincoln hirelings from the city!"shouted Breckinridge, and
the excited crowd took up the cry.A demand was at once drawn up, signed by Breckinridge, Morgan and many
others, and sent to Colonel Bramlette, requesting him to at once
withdraw from the city, or blood would be shed.Colonel Bramlette's lips curled in scorn as he read the demand, and
turning to the messenger who brought it, said: "Go tell the gentlemen
they shall have my answer shortly."Writing an answer, he turned to Fred, saying: "Here, my boy, for what
you have done, you richly deserve the honor of delivering this message."Right proudly did Fred bear himself as he delivered his message to
Breckinridge.Major Hockoday, who was standing by Breckinridge, scowled
and muttered, "It's that ---- Shackelford boy."Captain Conway heard him, and seeing Fred, with a fearful oath, sprang
towards him with uplifted hand.He had not seen Fred since that night he
plunged from the train.His adventure had become known, and he had to
submit to any amount of chaffing at being outwitted by a boy; and his
brother officers took great delight in calling out: "Look out, Conway,
here comes that detective from Danville!"This made Captain Conway hate Fred with all the ardor of his small soul,
and seeing the boy, made him so forget himself as to attack him.But a revolver flashed in his face, and a firm voice said: "Not so fast,
Captain."The irate captain was seized and dragged away, and when the tumult had
subsided Breckinridge said: "I am sorry to see the son of my friend,
Colonel Shackelford, engaged in such business; but it is the message
that he brings that concerns us."He then read the following laconic note from Colonel Bramlette:


     LEXINGTON, Aug.JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE, JOHN H. MORGAN AND OTHERS.Gentlemen:--I shall take those arms, and if a drop of Union blood
     be shed, I will not leave a single Secessionist alive in Lexington.THOMAS E. BRAMLETTE,
     _Colonel Commanding_.There was a breathless silence; faces of brave men grew pale.There were
oaths and muttered curses, but the mob began to melt away.The train arrived, and Colonel Bramlette took charge of it without
trouble.Just as the troop of cavalry was leaving Lexington, a boy came
out and thrust a note into Fred's hand.He opened it and read:


     TO FRED SHACKELFORD:

     Boy as you are, I propose to shoot you on sight, so be on your
     guard.Fred smiled, and handed the note to Colonel Bramlette, who read it and
said: "Fred, you will have to look out for that fellow."The journey back to Dick Robinson was without incident.The long looked
for arms and ammunition had come.It meant everything to those men
surrounded as they were with enemies on every side.In the midst of the
rejoicing, Fred was not forgotten.He and Colonel Bramlette were the
heroes of the hour.The fight for the possession of the arms was over.General Nelson, the man of iron
nerve, who, in the face of opposition from friends, the most direful
threats from foes, saved Central Kentucky to the Union, had been
relieved of his command and assigned to another field of labor.The new
commander to take his place was General George H. Thomas.To Fred the news that _his_ general, as he had come to look upon Nelson,
had been assigned to another command, was anything but pleasing."But
where Nelson goes, there will I go," was his thought."After all," he
said, bitterly, "what does it matter where I go.General Thomas, like Nelson, was a heavy, thickset man, but there the
likeness ended.Thomas never lost his temper, he never swore, he never
complained, he never got excited.He was always cool and collected, even
under the most trying circumstances.He afterwards became known to his
soldiers as "Pap Thomas," and was sometimes called "Slow-Trot Thomas,"
for the reason he was never known to ride his horse off a trot, even in
the most desperate battle.When General Thomas reported to Camp Dick Robinson he and Nelson held a
long consultation."This, General, is Fred Shackelford, the boy of whom I spoke," said
Nelson.Fred saluted the new commander, and then respectfully remained standing,
awaiting orders."Fred," continued General Nelson, "General Thomas and I have been
discussing you, and I have been telling him how valuable your services
have been.I fully expected to take you with me to my new command, but
both General Thomas and myself feel that just at present your services
are very much needed here.This camp is very important, and it is
surrounded with so many dangers that we need to take every precaution.You are not only well acquainted with the country, but you seem to have
a peculiar way of getting at the enemy's secrets no other one possesses.There is no doubt but you are needed here more than at Maysville, where
I am going.But we have concluded to leave it to you, whether you go or
stay.You may be sure I shall be pleased to have you go with me.Fred looked at General Thomas, and thought he had never seen a finer,
grander face; but he had grown very fond of the fiery Nelson, so he
replied:

"General Nelson, you know my feelings towards you.If I consulted simply my own wishes I should go with you.But
you have pointed out to me my duty.I am very grateful to General Thomas
for his feelings towards me.I shall stay as long as I am needed here,
and serve the general to the best of my ability.""Bravely said, Fred, bravely said," responded Nelson."You will find
General Thomas a more agreeable commander than myself.""There, General, that will do," said Thomas quietly.So it was settled that Fred was to stay for the present with General
Thomas.The next day Generals Thomas and Nelson went to Cincinnati to confer
with General Anderson, and Fred was invited to accompany them.Once more he was asked to lay before General Anderson the full text of
the conversation he had overheard at Georgetown.asked Thomas, who had listened very
closely to the recital."I am afraid," replied General Anderson, "that the authorities at
Washington do not fully realize the condition of affairs in Kentucky.Neither have they any conception of the intrigue going on to take the
State out of the Union.No doubt, General Buckner has been playing a
sharp game at Washington.He seems to have completely won the confidence
of the President.It is for this reason so many of our requests pass
unheeded.If what young Shackelford has heard is true, General Buckner
is now in Richmond.He is there to accept a command from the
Confederate government, and is to return here to organize the disloyal
forces of Kentucky to force the State out of the Union.Now, in the face
of these facts, what do you think of this," and the general read the
following:


     EXECUTIVE MANSION, Aug.My Dear Sir:--Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to
     me, make out a commission for Simon B. Buckner as a
     Brigadier-General of volunteers.It is to be put in the hands of
     General Anderson, and delivered to General Buckner, or not, at the
     discretion of General Anderson.Of course, it is to remain a secret
     unless and until the commission is delivered.During the reading, General Thomas sat with immovable countenance,
betraying neither approbation nor disgust.he roared, "are they all idiots at Washington?Give him his commission,
Anderson, give him his commission, and then let Lincoln invite Jeff
Davis to a seat in the cabinet.It would be as sensible," and then he
poured forth such a volley of oaths that what he really meant to say
became obscure.When he had blown himself out, General Thomas quietly said: "Now,
General, that you have relieved yourself, let us again talk business.""I don't believe you would change countenance, Thomas, if Beauregard was
placed in command of the Federal armies," replied Nelson, pettishly."But Central Kentucky needed just
such fire and enthusiasm as you possess to save it from the clutches of
the rebels, and if I can only complete the grand work you have begun I
shall be content, and not worry over whom the President recommends for
office.""You will complete it, General; my work could not be left in better
hands," replied Nelson, completely mollified.In a few moments Nelson excused himself, as he had other duties to
perform.Looking after him, General Anderson said: "I am afraid Nelson's temper
and unruly tongue will get him into serious trouble yet.But he has done
what I believe no other man could have done as well.To his efforts,
more than to any other one man, do we owe our hold on Kentucky.""His lion-like courage and indomitable energy will cover a multitude of
faults," was the reply of General Thomas.Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson with General Thomas, and he soon
found that the general was fully as energetic as Nelson, though in a
more quiet way.The amount of work that General Thomas dispatched was
prodigious.Every little detail was looked after, but there was no
hurry, no confusion.The camp began to assume a more military aspect,
and the men were brought under more thorough discipline.According to the
program which Fred had heard outlined at Georgetown, the Confederates
began their aggressive movements.Hickman, on the Mississippi River, was
occupied by the Confederate army under General Polk on the 5th.As swift
as a stroke of lightning, General Grant, who was in command at Cairo,
Illinois, retaliated by occupying Paducah on the 6th.General Polk then
seized the important post of Columbus on the 7th.A few days afterward
General Buckner moved north from Tennessee, and occupied Bowling Green.At the same time General Zollicoffer invaded the State from Cumberland
Gap.All three of these Confederate generals issued stirring addresses
to all true Kentuckians to rally to their support.It was confidently
expected by the Confederate authorities that there would be a general
uprising throughout the State in favor of the South.But they were
grievously disappointed; the effect was just the opposite.The
Legislature, then in session at Frankfort, passed a resolution
commanding the Governor to issue a proclamation ordering the
Confederates at once to evacuate the State.Governor Magoffin, much to
his chagrin, was obliged to issue the proclamation.A few days later the
Legislature voted that the State should raise a force of 40,000 men, and
that this force be tendered the United States for the purpose of putting
down rebellion.An invitation was also extended to General Anderson to
assume command of all these forces.Thus, to their chagrin, the
Confederates saw their brightest hopes perish.Instead of their getting
possession of the State, even neutrality had perished.The State was
irrevocably committed to the Union, but the people were as hopelessly
divided as ever.It was to be a battle to the death between the opposing
factions.Shortly after his return to Dick Robinson, Fred began to long to hear
from home, to know how those he loved fared; so he asked General Thomas
for a day or two of absence.It was readily granted, and soon he was on
his way to Danville.He found only his Uncle and Aunt Pennington at
home.His father had gone South to accept the colonelcy of a regiment,
and was with Buckner.His cousin Calhoun had accompanied Colonel
Shackelford South, having the promise of a position on the staff of some
general officer.His little sister Bessie had been sent to Cincinnati to
a convent school.The adherents of the opposing factions were more
bitter toward each other than ever, and were ready to spring at each
other's throats at the slightest provocation.Neighbors were estranged,
families were broken, nevermore to be reunited; and over all there
seemed to be hanging the black shadow of coming sorrow.Kentucky was not
only to be deluged in blood, but with the hot burning tears of those
left behind to groan and weep.Fred was received coldly by his uncle and aunt."You know," said Judge
Pennington, "my house is open to you, but I cannot help feeling the
keenest sorrow over your conduct.""I am sorry, very sorry, uncle, if what I have done has grieved you,"
answered Fred."No one can be really sorry who persists in his course," answered the
judge."Fred, rather--yes, a thousand times--had I rather see you dead
than doing as you are.If my brave boy falls," and his voice trembled as
he spoke, "I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that he fell in a
glorious cause.But you, Fred, you----" his voice broke; he could say no
more."Uncle," he softly said, "I admit you are honest
and sincere in your belief.Why can you not admit as much for me?Why is
it a disgrace to fight for the old flag, to defend the Union that
Washington and Jefferson helped form, and that Jackson defended?""The wrong," answered Judge Pennington, "consists in trying to coerce
sovereign States.The Constitution gives any State the right to withdraw
from the Union at pleasure.The South is fighting for her constitutional
rights----"

"And for human slavery," added Fred."Look out, Fred," he exclaimed, choking with passion, "lest I drive you
from my door, despite my promise to your father.You
are not only fighting against the South, but you are becoming a detested
Abolitionist--a <DW65> worshiper."Fred felt his manhood aroused, but controlling his passion he calmly
replied:

"Uncle, I will not displease you longer with my presence.The time may
come when you may need my help, instead of my needing yours.If so, do
not hesitate to call on me.I still love my kindred as well as ever;
they are as near to me as ever.There is no dishonor in a man loyally
following what he honestly believes to be right.I believe you and my
father to be wrong--that your sympathies have led you terribly astray;
but in my sight you are none the less true, noble, honest men.As for
me, I answer for myself.I am for the Union, now and forever.May God keep all of those we love from harm," and he rode away.Judge Pennington gazed after him with a troubled look, and then murmured
to himself: "After all, a fine boy, a grand boy!Upon Fred's return to headquarters he found General Thomas in deep
consultation with his staff.Circulars had been scattered all over the
State and notices printed in newspapers calling for a meeting of the
State Guards at Lexington on the 20th.Ostensibly the object of the
meeting was to be for a week's drill, and for the purpose of better
preparing the Guards to protect the interests of the State.But General
Thomas believed there was a hidden meaning in the call; that it was
conceived in deceit, and that it meant treachery.What this treachery
was he did not know, and it was this point he was discussing with his
staff when Fred entered.The sight of the boy brought a smile to his
face.he exclaimed, "I am glad to see you.We have a hard
problem; it is one rather in your line.He then laid the circular before Fred, and expressed his opinion that it
contained a hidden meaning."There is no end to those fellows'
plottings," he said, "and we are still weak, very weak here.With
General Zollicoffer moving this way from Cumberland Gap, it would not
take much of a force in our rear to cause a great disaster.In fact, a
hostile force at Lexington, even if small, would be a serious matter."Fred read the circular carefully, as if reading between the lines, and
then asked:

"It is the real meaning of this call that you wish?""By all means, if it can be obtained," answered the general."I will try to obtain it," replied Fred, quietly."General you may not
hear from me for two or three days.""May success attend you, my boy," replied the general, kindly, and with
this he dismissed his staff."It has come to a pretty pass," said a dapper young lieutenant of the
staff to an older member, "that the general prefers a boy to one of us,"
and he drew himself proudly up, as if to say, "Now, if the general had
detailed me, there might have been some hopes of success."The older member smiled, and answered: "I think it just as well,
Lieutenant, that he chose the boy.I don't think either you or me fitted
for that kind of work."Again a black-haired, dark-skinned boy left headquarters at Dick
Robinson, this time for Lexington.Arriving there, Fred took a room at
the leading hotel, registering as Charles Danford, Cincinnati, thinking
it best to take an entirely fictitious name.He soon learned that the
leading Southern sympathizers of the city were in the habit of meeting
in a certain room at the hotel.He kept very quiet, for there was one
man in Lexington he did not care to meet, and that man was Major
Hockoday.He knew that the major would recognize him as the boy he met
at Georgetown, and that meant the defeat of his whole scheme.Fred's
first step was to make friends with the chamber maid, a comely mulatto
girl.This he did with a bit of flattery and a generous tip.By adroit
questioning, he learned that the girl had charge of the room in which
the meetings of the conspirators were held.Could she in any manner secrete him in the room during one of the
meetings?"No, youn' massa, no!""Not fo' fiv' 'undred," answered the girl."Massa kill me, if he foun'
it out."Fred saw that she could not be bribed; he would have to try a new tack."See here, Mary," he asked, "you would like to be free, would you not,
just like a white girl?""Yes, massa, I woul' like dat.""You have heard of President Lincoln, have you not?"The girl's eyes lit up with a sudden fire."Yes, Massa Linkun good; he
want to free we 'uns.All de <DW65>s talkin' 'bout dat.""Mary, I am a friend of Lincoln.The
men who meet in that room are his enemies."I am here trying to find out their plans, so we can keep them from
killing Mr.Mary, you must help me, or you will be blamed for
what may happen, and you will never be free.""Massa will whip me to death, if he foun' it
out," she blubbered."Your master will never find it out, even if I am discovered, for I will
never tell on you.""Yes; I will swear it on the Bible."Like most of her race, the girl was very superstitious, and had great
reverence for the Bible.She went and brought one, and with his hand on
the book Fred took a most solemn oath never to betray her--no, not if he
was torn to pieces with red-hot pincers.Along toward night she came and whispered to Fred that she had been
told to place the room in order.There was, she said, but one place to
hide, and that was behind a large sofa, which stood across one corner of
the room.It was a perilous hiding place, but Fred resolved to risk it."They can but kill me," thought he, "and I had almost as soon die as
fail."It was getting dark when Mary unlocked the door of the room and let Fred
slip in.He found that by lying close to the sofa, he might escape
detection, though one should glance over the top.The minutes passed like hours to the excited boy.The slightest noise
startled him, and he found himself growing nervous, and in spite of all
his efforts, a slight tremor shook his limbs.At last he heard
foot-falls along the hall, the door was unlocked, and some one entered
the room.It was the landlord, who lit the gas, looked carefully around,
and went out.Fred's nervousness was all
gone; but his heart beat so loudly that he thought it must be heard.It
was a notable gathering of men distinguished not only in State but
national affairs.Chief among them was John C. Breckinridge, as knightly
and courteous as ever; then there were Colonel Humphrey Marshall, John
H. Morgan, Colonel Preston, and a score of others.These men had
gathered for the purpose of dragging Kentucky out of the Union over the
vote of her citizens, and in spite of her loyal Legislature.In their
zeal they threw to the winds their own beloved doctrine of State
rights, and would force Kentucky into the Southern Confederacy whether
she wanted to go or not.They believed the South was right, that it was their duty to defend her,
and that any means were lawful to bring about the desired end.Fred, as he lay in his hiding place, hardly dared to breathe.Once his
heart ceased to beat when he heard Morgan say: "There is room behind
that sofa for one to hide."Colonel Marshall glanced behind it, and said: "There is no one there."Then they commenced to talk, and Fred lay and listened to the whole
plot.The State Guards were to assemble, professedly, as the circular
stated, for muster and drill, but really for one of the most daring of
_coups-de-main_.The State arsenal at Frankfort was to be taken by surprise, and the arms
secured.The loyal Legislature was then to be dispersed at the point of
the bayonet, a provisional Legislature organized, and the State voted
out of the Union.The force was then to attack Camp Dick Robinson, in
conjunction with General Zollicoffer, who was to move up from Cumberland
Gap; and between the two forces it was thought the camp would fall an
easy prey.In the mean time, Buckner was to make a dash for Louisville
from Bowling Green.If he failed to take it by surprise, all the forces
were to join and capture it, thus placing the whole State in the control
of the Confederates.It was a bold, but admirably conceived plan.Breckinridge pointed out that the plan was
feasible.He said the ball once started, thousands of Kentuckians would
spring to arms all over the State.The plan was earnestly discussed and
fully agreed to.The work of each man was carefully mapped out, and
every detail carefully arranged.At last the meeting was over, and the
company began to pass out.He had succeeded; the full details of
the plot were in his possession.Waiting until all were well out of the
room, he crawled from his hiding place, and passed out.But he had
exulted too soon in his success.He had scarcely taken three steps from
the door before he came face to face with Major Hockoday, who was
returning for something he had forgotten."Now I have you, you young imp of Satan,"
and he made a grab for his collar.But Fred was as quick and lithe as a
cat, and eluding the major's clutch, he gave him such a blow in the face
that it staggered him against the wall.Before he recovered from the
effects of the blow Fred had disappeared.gasped the Major, and he made a grab for his
collar.]The major's face was
covered with blood, and he truly presented a gory appearance.It was
some time before the excitement subsided so the major could tell his
story.It was that a young villain had assaulted and attempted to murder
him.By his description, the landlord at once identified the boy as the
one who occupied room 45.But a search revealed the fact that the bird
had flown.It was also ascertained that the major had received no
serious injury.By request of the major the meeting was hastily re-convened.There, in
its privacy, he gave the true history of the attempted murder, as the
guests of the hotel thought it.The major expressed his opinion that the
boy was a spy.He was sure it was the same boy he had met in the hotel
at Georgetown."You know," he said, "that the landlord at Georgetown
found a hole drilled through the plastering of the room that this boy
occupied, into the one which was occupied by me and in which we held a
meeting.I tell you, the boy is a first-class spy, and I would not be
surprised if he was concealed somewhere in this room during the
meeting."cried several voices, but nevertheless a
number of faces grew pale."There is no place he could hide in this room, except behind the sofa,
and I looked there," said Marshall."Gentlemen," said the landlord, "this room is kept locked."All I know," said the major, "I met him about three paces from the
door, just as I turned the corner.When I attempted to stop him, he
suddenly struck the blow and disappeared.If it was not for his black
hair, I should be more than ever convinced that the boy was Fred
Shackelford.""In league with the devil, probably," growled Captain Conway."For if
there was ever one of his imps on earth, it's that Shackelford boy.Curse him, I will be even with him yet.""And so will I," replied the major, gently feeling of his swollen nose."Gentlemen," said John H. Morgan, "this is no time for idle regrets.Whether that boy has heard anything or not, we cannot tell.But from
what Major Hockoday has said, there is no doubt but that he is a spy.His assault on the major and fleeing show that.So it behooves us to be
careful.I have a trusty agent at Nicholasville, who keeps me fully
informed of all that transpires there.I will telegraph him particulars,
and have him be on the watch for such a boy."It was an uneasy crowd that separated that night.It looked as if one
boy might bring to naught all their well-laid plans.The next morning Morgan received the following telegram from
Nicholasville:


     JOHN H. MORGAN:

     Early this morning a black-haired, dark-skinned boy, riding a jaded
     horse, came in on the Lexington pike.Without stopping for
     refreshments he left his horse, and procured a fresh one, which the
     same boy left here a couple of days ago, and rode rapidly away in
     the direction of Camp Dick Robinson."I must put all the boys on their
guard."Late in the afternoon of the 19th the following telegram was received by
Morgan from Nicholasville:


     JOHN H. MORGAN:

     Colonel Bramlette with his regiment has just forcibly taken
     possession of a train of cars, and will at once start for
     Lexington.That night Breckinridge, Marshall, Morgan and half a score of others
fled from Lexington.Their plottings had come to naught; instead of
their bright visions of success, they were fugitives from their homes.It would have fared ill with that black-haired boy if they could have
got hold of him just then.When Fred escaped from Major Hockoday, he lost no time in making his way
to the home of one of the most prominent Union men of Lexington.Telling
him he had most important dispatches for General Thomas, a horse was
procured, and through the darkness of the night Fred rode to
Nicholasville, reaching there early in the morning.Leaving his tired
horse, and taking his own, which he had left there, he rode with all
speed to Camp Dick Robinson, and made his report to General Thomas.He warmly congratulated
Fred, saying it was a wonderful piece of work."Let's see," said he,
"this is the 16th.I do not want to scare them, as I wish to make a fine
haul, take them right in their treasonable acts.It's the only way I can
make the government believe it.On the 19th I will send Colonel
Bramlette with his regiment with orders to capture the lot.I will also
have to guard against the advance of General Zollicoffer.As for the
advance of General Buckner on Louisville, that is out of my department.""And there," said Fred, "is where our greatest danger lies.Louisville
is so far north they are careless, forgetting that Buckner has a
railroad in good repair on which to transport his men."answered Fred, and then he asked for a map.After studying it
for some time, he turned to Thomas and said:

"General, I have a favor to ask.I would like a leave of absence for a
week.I have an idea I want to work out."Thomas sat looking at the boy a moment, and then said: "It is nothing
rash, is it, my boy?""No more so than what I have done," answered Fred."In fact, I don't
know that I will do anything.It is only an idea I want to work on; it
may be all wrong.That is the reason I can't explain it to you.""You are not going to enter the enemy's lines as a spy, are you?You are too young and too valuable to risk your life that
way.""No, General, at least I trust not.The rebels will have to get much
farther north than they are now if I enter their lines, even if I carry
out my idea.""Very well, Fred; you have my consent, but be very careful.""I shall try to be so, General.I only hope that the suspicions I have
are groundless, and my journey will prove a pleasure trip."Thus saying, Fred bade the general good day, and early the next morning
he rode away, taking the road to Danville.Fred did not stop in Danville; instead, he avoided the main street, so
as to be seen by as few of his acquaintances as possible.He rode
straight on to Lebanon before he stopped.Here he put up for the night,
giving himself and his horse a good rest.The country was in such a
disturbed condition that every stranger was regarded with suspicion, and
forced to answer a multitude of questions.Fred did not escape, and to
all he gave the same answer, that he was from Danville, and that he was
on his way to Elizabethtown to visit his sick grandfather.He was especially interested
in Prince, examining him closely, and remarking he was one of the finest
horses he ever saw.Fred learned that the man's name was Mathews, that
he was a horse dealer, and was also a violent sympathizer with the
South.He was also reputed to be something of a bully.Fred thought some
of his questions rather impertinent, and gave rather short answers,
which did not seem to please Mathews.Leaving Lebanon early the next morning, he rode nearly west, it being
his intention to strike the Louisville and Nashville railroad a little
south of Elizabethtown.It was a beautiful September day, and as Fred
cantered along, he sang snatches of songs, and felt merrier and happier
than at any time since that sad parting with his father.And he thought of that strange
oath which bound Calhoun and himself together, and wondered what would
come of it all.But what was uppermost in his mind was the object of his
present journey.Was there anything in it, or was it a fool's errand?As he was riding along a country road, pondering these
things, it suddenly occurred to him that the landscape appeared
familiar.He reined up his horse, and looked around.The fields
stretching away before him, the few trees, and above all a tumbled down,
half-ruined log hut.Yet he knew he had never
been there before.Could he have seen this in a dream
sometime?The more he looked, the more familiar it seemed; and the more
he was troubled.A countryman came along riding a raw-boned spavined horse; a rope served
for a bridle, and an old coffee sack strapped on the sharp back of the
horse took the place of a saddle.Having no stirrups, the countryman's
huge feet hung dangling down and swung to and fro, like two weights tied
to a string; a dilapidated old hat, through whose holes stuck tufts of
his bleached tow hair, adorned his head."Stranger, you 'uns 'pears to be interested," he remarked to Fred, as
he reined in his steed, and at the same time ejected about a pint of
tobacco juice from his capacious mouth."Yes," answered Fred, "this place seems to be very familiar--one that I
have seen many times; yet to my certain knowledge, I have never been
here before."Seen it in a picter, I reckon," drawled the countryman."Nothin', stranger, only they do say the picter of that air blamed old
shanty is every whar up No'th.I don't see anything
great in it.I wish it war sunk before he war born.""Why, man, what do you mean?replied the native, expectorating at a stone in the road, and
hitting it fairly."I mean that the gol-all-fir'-est, meanest cuss that
ever lived war born thar, the man what's making war on the South, and
wants to put the <DW65>s ekal to us.Abe Lincoln, drat him, war born in
that ole house."This then was the lowly birthplace of
the man whose name was in the mouths of millions.How mean, how poor it
looked, and yet to what a master mind it gave birth!The life of
Lincoln had possessed a peculiar fascination for Fred, and during the
presidential campaign of the year before the picture of his birthplace
had been a familiar one to him.He now understood why the place looked
so familiar.It was like looking on the face of one he had carefully
studied in a photograph."Reckon you are a stranger, or you would have knowed the place?""Yes, I am a stranger," answered Fred."Then this is the place where the
President of the United States was born?""Yes, an' it war a po' day for ole Kentuck when he war born.Oughter to
ha' died, the ole Abolitioner."Fred smiled, "Well," he said, "I must be going.I am very much obliged
to you for your information.""Don't mention it, stranger, don't mention it.Say, that's a mighty fine
hoss you air ridin'; look out or some of them fellers scootin' round the
country will get him.Times mighty ticklish, stranger, mighty ticklish.and he extended a huge roll of Kentucky
twist."No, thank you," responded Fred, and bidding the countryman good day, he
rode away leaving him in the road staring after him, and muttering:
"Mighty stuck up!Wonder if he aint one of them
Abolitioners!"It was the middle of the afternoon when Fred struck the railroad at a
small station a few miles south of Elizabethtown.There was a crowd
around the little depot, and Fred saw that they were greatly excited.Hitching his horse, he mingled with the throng, and soon learned that
the train from the south was overdue several hours.To add to the
mystery, all telegraphic communication with the south had been severed.Strike the instrument as often as he might, the operator could get no
response."It's mighty queer," said an intelligent looking man."There is mischief
up the road of some kind.Here Louisville has been telegraphing like mad
for hours, and can't get a reply beyond this place."Here the operator came out and announced that telegraphic communication
had also been severed on the north."We are entirely cut off," he said.We will have
to wait and see what's the matter, that's all."Just then away to the south a faint tinge of smoke was seen rising, and
the cry was raised that a train was coming.The excitement arose to
fever heat, and necks were craned, and eyes strained to catch the first
glimpse of the train.At length its low rumbling could be heard, and
when at last it hove in sight, it was seen to be a very heavy one.Slowly it drew up to the station, and to the surprise of the lookers-on
it was loaded down with soldiers.shouted the soldiers, and the crowd took up
the cry.It was Buckner's army from Bowling Green en route for
Louisville by train, hoping thereby to take the place completely by
surprise.Telegraphic communications
all along the line had been severed by trusty agents; the Federal
authorities at Louisville were resting in fancied security; the city was
lightly guarded.In fancy, he heard his name
on every tongue, and heard himself called the greatest military genius
of the country.When the crowd caught the full meaning of the movement,
cheer after cheer made the welkin ring.They grasped the soldiers'
hands, and bade them wipe the Yankees from the face of the earth.This was the idea of which he
spoke to General Thomas.He had an impression that General Buckner might
attempt to do just what he was now doing.It was the hope of thwarting
the movement, if made, that had led Fred to make the journey.His
impressions had proven true; he was on the ground, but how to stop the
train was now the question.He had calculated on plenty of time, that he
could find out when the train was due, and plan his work accordingly.In a moment or two it would be gone, and
with it all opportunity to stop it.If
anything was done, it must be done quickly.The entire population of
the little village was at the depot; there was little danger of his
being noticed.Dashing into a blacksmith shop he secured a sledge; then
mounting his horse, he rode swiftly to the north.About half a mile from
the depot there was a curve in the track which would hide him from
observation.Jumping Prince over the low fence which guarded the
railroad, in a few seconds he was at work with the sledge trying to
batter out the spikes which held a rail in position.His face was pale,
his teeth set.Great drops of perspiration stood
out on his forehead, and his blows rang out like the blows of a giant.The train whistled; it was ready to start.Between his strokes he could hear the clang of the bell, the
parting cheers of the crowd.The heads of the
spikes flew off; they were driven in and the plates smashed.One end of
a rail was loosened; it was driven in a few inches.The deed was done,
and none too soon.So busy was Fred that he had not noticed that two men on horseback had
ridden up to the fence, gazed at him a moment in astonishment, then
shouted in anger, and dismounted.Snatching a revolver from his pocket,
Fred sent a ball whistling by their ears, and yelled: "Back!Jumping on their horses quicker than they dismounted, they galloped
toward the approaching train, yelling and wildly gesticulating.The
engineer saw them, but it was before the day of air brakes, and it was
impossible to stop the heavy train.The engine plunged off the track,
tore up the ground and ties for a few yards, and then turned over on its
side, where it lay spouting smoke and steam, and groaning like a thing
of life.It lay partly across the track, thus completely blocking it.The engineer and fireman had jumped, and so slowly was the train running
that the cars did not leave the track.For this Fred was devoutly
thankful.He had accomplished his object, and no one had been injured.Jumping on his horse, he gave a shout of triumph and rode away.But the frightened soldiers had been pouring from the cars.The two men
on horseback were pointing at Fred and yelling: "There!there goes the
villain who did it."thundered a colonel who had just sprung out of the
foremost car.Fred's horse, was seen to stumble
slightly; the boy swayed, and leaned forward in his seat; but quickly
recovering himself, he turned around and waving his hat shouted
defiance.thundered a Colonel who had just sprung out
of the foremost car.]"That is Fred Shackelford, and
that horse is Prince."The colonel
who had given the order to fire turned pale, staggered and would have
fallen if one of his officers had not caught him."I ordered my men to fire on my own son."The officers gathered around General Buckner, who stood looking at the
wrecked engine with hopeless despair pictured in every feature.His
visions of glory had vanished, as it were, in a moment.No plaudits from
an admiring world, no "Hail!Utter failure
was the end of the movement for which he had hoped so much.It would take hours to clear away the wreck.He groaned
in the agony of his spirit, and turned away.His officers stood by in
silence; his sorrow was too great for words of encouragement.Colonel Shackelford tottered up
to General Buckner, pale as death, and trembling in every limb."General," he gasped, "it was my boy, my son who did this.I am unworthy
to stand in your presence for bringing such a son into the world.Cashier me, shoot me if you will.The soul of the man who refused to desert his soldiers at Fort Donelson,
when those in command above him fled, who afterwards helped bear General
Grant to his tomb, with a heart as tender as that of a woman, now
asserted itself.His own terrible disappointment was forgotten in the
sorrow of his friend.Grasping the hand of Colonel Shackelford, he said
with the deepest emotion:

"Colonel, not a soldier will hold you responsible.This is a struggle
in which the noblest families are divided.If this deed had been for the
South instead of the North, you would be the proudest man in the
Confederacy.Can we not see the bravery, the heroism of the deed, even
though it has dashed our fondest hopes to the ground, shattered and
broken?No, Colonel, I shall not accept your resignation.I know you
will be as valiant for the South, as your son has been for the North."Tears gushed from Colonel Shackelford's eyes; he endeavored to speak,
but his tongue refused to express his feelings.The officers, although
bowed down with disappointment, burst into a cheer, and there was not
one who did not feel prouder of their general in his disappointment than
if he had been successful.General Thomas had warned
General Anderson, who had moved his headquarters to that city, that
General Buckner was contemplating an advance.But it was thought that he
would come with waving banners and with the tramp of a great army, and
that there would be plenty of time to prepare for him.Little did they
think he would try to storm the city with a train of cars, and be in
their midst before they knew it.When the train was delayed and
telegraphic communications severed, it was thought that some accident
had happened.There was not the slightest idea of the true state of
affairs.As hours passed and nothing was heard of the delayed train, a
train of discovery was sent south to find out what was the matter.This
train ran into Buckner's advance at Elizabethtown, and was seized.Not hearing anything from this train, an engine was sent after it.Still
there was no idea of what had happened, no preparations to save
Louisville.This engine ran into Buckner's advance at Muldraugh Hill.The fireman was a loyal man and at once grasped the situation.He leaped
from his engine and ran back.What could this one man do, miles from
Louisville, and on foot!Meeting some section hands
with a handcar, he shouted: "Back!the road above is swarming with
rebels."Great streams of perspiration ran down their
bodies; their breath came in gasps, and still the fireman shouted: "Work
her lively, boys, for God's sake, work her lively!"At last Louisville was reached, and for the first time the facts known.Once
more the devoted Home Guards, the men who saved the city from riot and
bloodshed on July 22d, sprang to arms.General Rousseau was ordered from
across the river.These, with the Home Guards,
made a force of nearly 3,000 men.These men were hurried on board the
cars, and sent forward under the command of General W. T. Sherman.Through the darkness of the night this train felt its way.On reaching
Rolling Fork of Salt River the bridge was found to be burnt.Despairing
of reaching Louisville, General Buckner had destroyed the bridge to
delay the advance of the Federal troops.But how many American boys and girls know the name
of the daring young man who tore up the track, or the brave fireman who
brought back the news?[A]

But how was it with Fred; had he escaped unhurt from that volley?The stumble of his horse was caused by stepping into a hole, yet slight
as the incident was, it saved Fred's life, for it threw him slightly
forward, and at the same moment a ball tore through the crown of his
hat.Another ball struck the crupper of his saddle, and another one
bored a hole through Prince's right ear.As soon as he was out of sight Fred stopped, and, ascertaining that no
damage had been done, excepting the perforating of Prince's ear and his
hat, he patted his horse's neck and said: "Ah, Prince, old boy, you are
marked now for life, but it is all right.I shall always know you by
that little hole through your ear."Fred stopped that night at a planter's house, who at first viewed him
with some suspicion; but when he was told of Buckner's advance, he was
so overjoyed, being an ardent Secessionist, that there was nothing good
enough for his guest.The next day, when Fred rode into Lebanon, the first man that he saw
was Mathews, who sauntered up to him, and said in a sarcastic tone: "It
seems, young man, that you made a short visit to your poor sick
grandfather."I didn't
see the old gentleman; I concluded to come back.Things are getting a
little too brisk up there for me.Buckner has advanced, and there may be
some skirmishing around Elizabethtown.""And so you run," exclaimed Mathews in a tone which made Fred's blood
boil.All of this time Mathews had been carefully looking over the boy
and horse, and quite a crowd had collected around them.continued Mathews; "a round hole through your horse's ear, been
bleeding, too; your saddle torn by a bullet, and a hole through your
hat.Boy, you had better give an account of yourself.""Not at your command," replied Fred, hotly."And I deny your right to
question me.""You do, do you, my fine young fellow?I will show you," and he made a
grab for Prince's bridle.A sharp, quick word from Fred, and the horse sprang, overthrowing
Mathews, and scattering the crowd right and left.Mathews arose, shaking
the dust from his clothes and swearing like a trooper.A fine-looking man had just ridden up to the crowd as the incident
occurred.He looked after the flying boy, and nervously fingered the
revolver in his holster.Then a smile came over his face, and he spoke
to Mathews, who was still swearing and loudly calling for a horse to
pursue Fred."No use, Jim; you might as well chase a streak of lightning.That is the
fastest horse in Kentucky."Mathews looked at the man a moment in surprise, and then exclaimed:
"Heavens!"Made a run for it night before last," replied Morgan with a laugh, "to
keep from being nabbed by old Thomas.But what was the fuss between you
and that boy?I wonder what he was doing out here any way?But, Mathews,
he did upset you nicely; I think you rolled over at least six times.""I will be even with him yet," growled Mathews.I have heard half a dozen men say that, myself included.But let's
hear what the rumpus was about."When Morgan heard the story, he said: "So Buckner is at Elizabethtown,
is he?I was going to Bowling Green, but now
I will change my course to Elizabethtown.But I would like to know what
that boy has been doing.From what you say he must have been in a
skirmish.Trying to throw a train off the track, perhaps; it would be
just like him.""But, Mathews," he continued, "the boy is gone, so let us talk
business.I am going to raise a regiment of cavalry for the Confederate
service, and I want you to raise a company.""That I will, John," said Mathews."There is no other man I had rather
ride under."Fred laughed heartily as he looked back and saw Mathews shaking the dust
from himself.Finding that he was not pursued he brought Prince down to
a walk."I could almost swear," he said to himself, "that I caught a
glimpse of Morgan as I dashed through the crowd.Thomas surely ought to
have him before this time.As he was riding through Danville he met his uncle, Judge Pennington,
who, to his surprise, greeted him most cordially, and would insist on
his stopping a while."Over towards Elizabethtown to see my sick grandfather," replied Fred,
gravely.asked his uncle, somewhat nettled."Well, uncle, I have been over towards Elizabethtown ostensibly to see
my grandfather, but really to see what I could find over there.""I found Buckner's men as thick as hops, and I found a warm reception
besides.Look here," and he showed his uncle the hole through his hat."If you will go out and look at Prince, you will find a hole through
his ear, and you will also find the saddle torn with a bullet.Oh, yes,
Buckner's men were glad to see me; they gave me a warm reception.""Oh, I side-tracked one of their trains.""Fred," said he, "you are engaging in
dangerous business.I have heard of
some of your doings."Then it was he I saw at Lebanon."Because--because--I thought--I thought he was in Lexington.""It was because," answered the judge, severely, "that you thought he was
a prisoner at Camp Dick Robinson.Ah, Fred, you were not as sharp as you
thought.You foiled their plans; but, thank God!All pretense of neutrality is now at an
end.These men will now be found in the ranks, fighting for the liberty
of the South.As for Morgan, he will be heard from, mark my word.""He is a daring fellow, and sharp,
too; yes, I believe he will be heard from.""Fred, Morgan thinks you have had more to do with finding out their
plans than any other one person.""Morgan does me too much honor," replied Fred, quietly.The judge remained quiet for a moment, and then said: "My boy, I wish
you could have seen Morgan before you had so thoroughly committed
yourself to the other side.He
believes if he could talk with you, you might be induced to change your
mind.He says in the kind of work in which he expects to engage, you
would be worth a brigade of men.Fred, will you, will you not think of
this?You are breaking our hearts with your course now.""Dear uncle," replied Fred, "I thank Morgan for his good opinion, and I
reciprocate his opinion; for of all the men I have met, I believe he,
most of all, has the elements of a dashing, successful leader.But as
for his offer, I cannot consider it for a moment."The judge sighed, and Fred saw that his further presence was not
desirable, so he made his adieus, and rode away.Morgan wants to win me over," thought Fred, "and that was the
reason uncle was so nice.I think this last scrape has burnt the bridges
between us, and they will trouble me no more."Fred made his report to General Thomas, who heard it with evident
satisfaction."This, then, was your idea, Fred?""Yes, General, I in some way conceived the notion that Buckner would try
to surprise Louisville just as he did try to do.I knew that trains were
running regularly between Nashville and Louisville, and thought that a
surprise could be effected.But the idea was so vague I was ashamed to
tell you, for fear of exciting ridicule.So, I got my leave of absence
and stole off, and if nothing had come of it, no one would have been the
wiser."General Thomas smiled, and said: "It was an idea worthy of a great
general, Fred.General Anderson has much to thank you for, as well as
the people of Louisville.But you must take a good rest now, both you
and your horse.From appearances, I think it will not be many days
before General Zollicoffer will give us plenty to do."FOOTNOTE:

[A] The name of the gallant young man who tore up the track was
Crutcher; the author does not know the name of the fireman.On October 7th General Anderson, at his own request, was relieved of the
command of the Department of Kentucky, on account of continued
ill-health.The next day General W. T. Sherman, a man destined to fill
an important place in the history of the war, was appointed to the
position.Both the Federal and the Confederate governments had now
thrown aside all pretense of neutrality.Kentucky echoed to the martial
tread of armed men.At Maysville under General Nelson, at Camp Dick Robinson under General
Thomas, at Louisville under General Sherman, and at Paducah under
General Grant, the Federal government was gathering its hosts; while the
Confederate government with its troops occupied Columbus, Bowling Green,
Cumberland Gap, and the mountains of eastern Kentucky.General Albert
Sydney Johnston, one of the ablest of the Confederate generals, was in
supreme command, with headquarters at Bowling Green.General Zollicoffer marched from Cumberland Gap early in the month, and
assumed offensive operations.When General Sherman took command, Fred was sent by General Thomas to
Louisville with dispatches.General Sherman had heard of some of the
exploits of the young messenger, and he was received very kindly.Sherman, at that time, was in the prime of life.Straight as an arrow,
of commanding presence, he was every inch a soldier.He was quick and
impulsive in his actions, and to Fred seemed to be a bundle of nerves.In conversation he was open and frank and expressed his opinion freely,
in this resembling General Nelson.But the rough, overbearing nature of
Nelson he entirely lacked.He was one of the most courteous of men.He would have Fred tell of some of his exploits, and when he gave an
account of his first journey to Louisville, and his adventure with
Captain Conway, the general was greatly pleased.Fred's account of how
he discovered the details of the plot at Lexington was received with
astonishment, and he was highly complimented.But the climax came when
he told of how he had thrown the train from the track, and thus brought
Buckner's intended surprise to naught.The general jumped up, grasped
Fred's hand, and exclaimed:

"That, young man, calls for a commission, if I can get you one, and I
think I can.""General," replied Fred, "I thank you very much, but I do not wish a
commission.It is true, I am hired
privately by General Nelson, and if I understand rightly I am getting
the pay of a lieutenant; but I am not bound by oath to serve any length
of time, neither could I have accomplished what I have if I had been a
regular enlisted soldier.""But remember, if you are ever in
need of any favor, do not hesitate to call on me."This Fred readily promised, and left the general, highly elated over the
interview.Before leaving Louisville, Fred did not forget to call on the Vaughns.He found Miss Mabel well, and he thought her more beautiful than ever.A
sad, pensive look on her face but added to her loveliness.Only the day
before she had bidden her betrothed farewell, and he had marched to the
front to help fight the battles of his country.As she hung weeping
around his neck, he pointed to a little miniature flag pinned on his
breast--it was the same flag that Mabel wore on that day she was beset
by the mob--and said:

"Dearest, it shall be worn there as long as my heart beats.Never shall
it be touched by a traitorous hand as long as I live.Every time I look
upon it, it will be an incentive to prove worthy of the brave girl who
wore it on her breast in the face of a brutal mob."Then with one fond clasp of the hands, one long lingering kiss, he was
gone; and to Mabel all the light and joy of the world seemed to go with
him.But the coming of Fred brought new thoughts, and for the time her eyes
grew brighter, her cheeks rosier and laugh happier.The bright, brave
boy who saved her from the mob was very welcome, and to her he was only
a boy, a precious, darling boy.They made Fred relate his adventures, and one minute Mabel's eyes would
sparkle with fun, and the next melt in tenderness.In spite of himself,
Fred's heart beat very fast, he hardly knew why.But when he told with
trembling voice how he had parted from his father, and how he had been
disowned and driven from home, the sympathy of the impulsive girl
overcame her, and with eyes swimming in tears, she arose, threw her arms
around him, imprinted a kiss on his forehead, and murmured: "Poor boy!Then turning to her mother, she said, "We will adopt him,
won't we, mother, and I will have a brother."Then remembering what she had done, she retired blushing and in
confusion to her seat.That kiss finished Fred; it thrilled him through
and through.Yet somehow the thought of being a brother to Mabel didn't
give him any satisfaction.He knew Mabel looked upon him as only a boy,
and the thought made him angry, but the next moment he was ashamed of
himself.He took his leave, promising to call the next time he was in
the city, and went away with conflicting emotions.Fred was really suffering from an attack of first love, and didn't know
it.It was better for him that he didn't, for it was the sooner
forgotten.On his return to Camp Dick Robinson Fred found that General Thomas had
advanced some of his troops toward Cumberland Gap.Colonel Garrard was
occupying an exposed position on the Rock Castle Hills, and Fred was
sent to him with dispatches.Fred found the little command in
considerable doubt over the movements of General Zollicoffer.One hour
the rumor would be that he was advancing, and the next hour would bring
the story that he was surely retreating.Colonel Garrard feared that he
would be attacked with a greatly superior force.Fred resolved that he would do a little scouting on his own account.Colonel Garrard offered to send a small party with him, but Fred
declined the offer, saying that a squad would only attract attention,
and if he ran into danger he would trust to the fleetness of his horse
to save him.Riding east, he made a wide detour, and at last came to where he thought
he must be near the enemy's lines.In his front was a fine plantation;
near by, in the woods, some <DW64>s were chopping.These <DW64>s he
resolved to interview.His appearance created great consternation, and
some of them dropped their axes, and looked as if about to run."Don't be afraid, boys," said Fred, kindly."I only want to know who
lives in yonder house.""Not now, sah; he down to Zollicoffer camp.""Oh, then General Zollicoffer is camped near here?""Yes, sah; 'bout two mile down de road.""Do any of the soldiers ever come this way?""Yes, sah; 'bout twenty went up de road not mo' than two hours ago.Den
a capin man, he cum to see Missy Alice most ebber day.""Thank you," said Fred, as he rode away."I think I will pay a visit to
Missy Alice myself."Riding boldly up to the house, he dismounted.Before entering the house
he accosted an old <DW64> who was working in the yard, and slipping a
dollar into his hand, said:

"Uncle, if you see any one coming either way, will you cry, 'Massa, your
horse is getting away?'""Trus' me fo' dat," said the old man, grinning from ear to ear."I jess
make dat hoss jump, and den I yell, 'Massa, hoss gittin' way.'""That's it, uncle, you are all right," and Fred turned and went into the
house, where he introduced himself as a Mr.He
had friends in Zollicoffer's army, and had run the gauntlet of the
Federal lines to visit them.Could they tell him how far it was to
General Zollicoffer's camp.The ladies received him coldly, but told him the distance.But Fred was
not to be repulsed.He was a good talker, and he tried his best.He told
them the news of the outside world, and what the Yankees were doing, and
how they would soon be driven from the State.This at once endeared him
to the ladies, especially the younger, who was a most pronounced little
rebel.Miss Alice was a comely girl, somewhere between twenty and
twenty-five years of age, and by a little but well directed flattery
Fred completely won her confidence.She inquired after some
acquaintances in Lexington, and by a happy coincidence Fred knew them,
and the conversation became animated.At length Fred remarked: "I hope it will not be long before General
Zollicoffer will advance.We are getting anxious up at Lexington; we
want to see the Yankees driven into the Ohio.""You will not have to wait long," replied the girl."Captain Conway
tells me they are about ready, and will advance on the 20th or 21st----"
she stopped suddenly, bit her lip, and looked scared.In all probability she had told something that Captain Conway had told
her to keep secret.Fred did not appear to notice her confusion, and at
once said: "Conway, Conway, Captain Conway.Is it Captain P. C. Conway
of whom you speak?""Yes, sir," replied the girl, brightening up."Why, I know him, know him like a book; in fact, we are old
friends--special friends, I may say.He would rejoice to find me here,"
and then he added mentally, "and cut my throat.""A brilliant soldier, and a brave one, is Captain Conway," continued
Fred, "and if he is given an opportunity to distinguish himself, it will
not be long before it will be Major or Colonel Conway."This praise pleased Miss Alice greatly, and she informed Fred that he
would soon have the pleasure of meeting his friend; that she expected
him every moment.Fred moved somewhat uneasily in his chair.He had no desire to meet
Captain Conway, and he was about to make an excuse of going out to see
how his horse was standing, when they were startled by the old <DW64>
running toward the house and yelling at the top of his voice: "Massa,
massa, yo' hoss is gittin' away."The sly old fellow had thrown a stone at Prince, and the horse was
rearing and plunging.Fred dashed out of the house; a party of horsemen was coming up the
road, in fact, was nearly to the house.It was but the work of a moment
for Fred to unhitch his horse and vault into the saddle, but the party
was now not more than fifty yards away.They had noticed the horse hitched at the gate, and were coming at full
speed to try and surprise the owner.The moment Conway saw Fred he knew
him.he cried, "Fred Shackelford, what luck!"and snatched a pistol
from the holster and fired.The ball whistled past Fred's head
harmlessly, and he turned in the saddle and returned the fire.It was
the first time he had ever shot at a man, and even in the heat of
excitement he experienced a queer sensation, a sinking of the heart, as
though he were committing a crime.Fairly and squarely the ball from his revolver struck the horse of
Captain Conway in the forehead, and the animal fell dead, the rider
rolling in the dust.His men stopped the pursuit, and,
dismounting, gathered around the captain, thinking he was killed.But he sprang to his feet, shouting: "A hundred dollars to the one who
will take that young devil, dead or alive.Here, Corporal Smith, you
have a fleet horse, let me take him," and jumping into the saddle, he
was in pursuit, followed by all his men, except Corporal Smith, who
stood in the road looking after them.asked the two ladies, who stood
on the veranda, wringing their hands, and very much excited."Blamed if I know," answered the corporal."The sight of that young chap
seemed to make the captain kinder crazy.The moment he caught sight of
him, he called him by name, and banged away at him.""You say the captain called him by name?""Well, he said he knew the captain, and that he was one of his best
friends.The corporal had no explanation to offer, so went and took a look at the
captain's horse.In the meantime the pursued and the pursuers had passed out of sight up
the road, enveloped in a cloud of dust."Remember, boys," shouted Conway, "a hundred dollars to the one who
brings him down.But it was nothing but play for Fred to distance them, and he laughed to
think that they expected to catch him.But the laugh suddenly died on
his lips; he turned pale, and glanced hurriedly to the right and left.A
high rail fence ran on each side of the road.The scouting party of
which the <DW64>s spoke was returning.Captain Conway saw the other party, and shouted in triumph."Now, boys, we have him," and he spurred his horse forward, revolver in
hand.There was a look of malignant hatred on his face, and he muttered:
"Now, my boy, I will settle scores with you.I shall never take you back
to camp.'Captured a spy, killed while trying to escape.'As for Fred, even in his extremity, his courage or his presence of mind
never deserted him.He felt that to be captured by Conway was death, for
had not the captain sworn to kill him on sight?His mind was made up; he
would wheel and charge the captain's party.Just as he was about to do this, he espied an opening in the
fence on the left.As quick as thought he dashed through it, thinking it
might afford a chance of escape.The field
was a perfect cul-de-sac, bounded on all sides by a high rail fence, the
only opening the one he had come through.Through this opening the enemy poured, and when they saw the trap which
Fred had entered, their shouts made the welkin ring.Their shouts rang in Fred's ears like the tolling of a
funeral bell.So must the bay of hounds sound in the ears of the hunted
quarry.It was built of heavy rails, and
full seven feet high.Bending over his horse's
neck, Fred said: "Prince, it is a question of life or death.Do your
best, old fellow; we can but fail."With
distended nostrils, eyes flashing with excitement, and every muscle
quivering, he gathered himself for the mighty spring.As lightly as a
bird he cleared the fence, staggered as he struck the ground on the
other side, then on again like the wind.Fred turned in his saddle, and uttered a yell of defiance.But the hands of his troopers were unsteady,
and the shots went wild.Before his men could dismount and throw down
the fence, Fred was beyond pursuit.Captain Conway fairly foamed at the
mouth.He raved and swore like a madman."It's no use swearing, Captain," said a grizzled lieutenant."I thought
I knew something about horses, but that beat any leap I ever saw.I would rather have the horse than the boy."it's the divil's own lape," said an Irishman in the
company, and he crossed himself.The baffled troopers returned crestfallen and cross.Captain Conway was
so out of temper that even when the ladies asked him if his fall hurt
him, he answered angrily."Captain," said Alice, somewhat ruffled by his manner, "what is it
between that boy and you?He said he knew you, was in fact a dear friend
of yours, but you no sooner saw him than you shot at him; and Corporal
Smith says you called him by name, so you did know him.""Alice," replied the captain, "I do not intend to be rude, but I am all
put out.That boy is a spy, a mean, sneaking spy.It was he that discovered our plot at Lexington.""And I told him----" She stopped
suddenly.nothing, nothing; only what a good fellow you were."The captain looked at her sharply, and said: "It is well you gave away
no secrets."Fred made his way back to camp with a thankful heart.He told Colonel
Garrard of the intended attack, and then started back for the
headquarters of General Thomas.It was a long and hard ride, and it was
well in the small hours of the night when he arrived.The general was
aroused and the news of the expected attack told.He quietly wrote a
couple of orders, and went back to his bed.One order was to General
Schoepf to at once march his brigade to the relief of Colonel Garrard at
Rock Castle.The other was sent to Colonel Connell at Big Hill to move
his regiment to Rock Castle, instead of advancing toward London as
ordered.Both orders were obeyed, and both commands were in position on the 20th.General Zollicoffer made his expected attack on the 21st, and was easily
repulsed.The battle was a small one; nothing but a skirmish it would
have been called afterwards; but to the soldiers engaged at that time,
it looked like a big thing.It greatly encouraged the Federal soldiers,
and correspondingly depressed the soldiers of Zollicoffer's army.Fred got back to Rock Castle in time to see the battle.It was his first
sight of dead and wounded soldiers.And as he looked on the faces of the
dead, their sightless eyes upturned to heaven, and the groans of the
wounded sounding in his ears, he turned sick at heart, and wondered why
men created in the image of God would try to kill and maim each other.And yet, a few moments before, he himself was wild with the excitement
of battle, and could scarcely be restrained from rushing into it.The next day the army advanced, and passed the place where Fred met
with his adventure, and he thought he would make another visit to Miss
Alice Johnson.But that young lady gave him a cold reception.She called
him a "miserable, sneaking Yankee," and turned her back on him in
disgust.He didn't hear the last of his call on Miss Johnson.Fred pointed out the place where his horse had leaped the fence, and
officers and men were astonished, and Prince became as much a subject of
praise as his rider.It was a common saying among the soldiers as he
rode by, "There goes the smartest boy and best horse in Kentucky."When Fred returned to Camp Dick Robinson, he found a letter awaiting him
from General Nelson.The general was making a campaign against a portion
of the command of General Humphrey Marshall in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky, and wrote that if Fred could possibly come to him to do so."Of course; go at once," said General Thomas, when the letter was shown
him."I am sorry to lose you, but I think Zollicoffer will be rather
quiet for a while, and General Nelson has the first claim on you.I
shall always be grateful to you for the service you have rendered me.I
trust that it is but the beginning of still closer relations in the
future."It was fated that General Thomas and Fred were to be much together
before the war closed.CHAPTER X.

IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.To his dismay, Fred noticed that the letter of General Nelson was dated
the 10th of October, and it was now the last of the month.For some
reason the letter had been greatly delayed.It was known that Nelson was already in the mountains of Eastern
Kentucky; therefore no time was to be lost if Fred joined him.Much to
his regret, Fred had to leave Prince behind.Afterwards he blessed his
stars that he did, for if he had taken the horse he would have lost him
forever.Fred traveled to Cincinnati by rail, and then by boat up the Ohio to
Maysville.He found that Nelson had not only been gone from Maysville
for some days, but that there was no direct line of communication with
his army.Nothing daunted, he determined to follow, and procuring a
horse, he started on his journey alone and unattended, and against the
advice of the officer in command at Maysville."Wait," said that officer, "until we send forward a train.It will be
strongly guarded, and you will escape all danger of capture."He believed it to be his duty to join Nelson
as soon as possible.By hard riding, he reached Hazel Green on the
evening of the second day, and without adventure.Here he learned that
Nelson's command had left the place only two days before, and was now
supposed to be at or near Prestonburg, and there were rumors of fighting
at that place.The next morning Fred pressed forward in high spirits, thinking he would
overtake at least the rear of Nelson's army by night.Along in the
afternoon four cavalrymen suddenly confronted him, blocking the road.As they all had on the blue Federal overcoat, Fred had not the remotest
idea but that they belonged to Nelson's army, and riding boldly up to
them asked how far the command was in advance.asked one of the party, who appeared to be the leader."Why, Nelson's command, of course," replied Fred, in surprise.But the
words were hardly out of his mouth before four revolvers were leveled on
him, and he was commanded to surrender.There was no alternative but to
submit as gracefully as possible."Now, boys," said the leader, "we will see what we have captured.It must be borne in mind that Fred was dressed in civilian clothes, and
therefore could not be taken prisoner as a soldier.The soldiers, after going through his pockets, handed the contents to
their leader."Ah," said that personage with a wicked grin, "young man, you may go
along with us to Colonel Williams.For aught I know, these letters may
hang you," and filing off from the Prestonburg road, they took a rough
mountain road for Piketon.Fred afterward found that the four soldiers were a scouting party that
had got in the rear of Nelson's army in the hopes of picking up some
stragglers, their only reward being himself.As was said, the party
consisted of four.The leader, Captain Bascom, was a hooked-nosed,
ferret-eyed man, who frequently took deep draughts from a canteen
containing what was familiarly known as "mountain dew"--whisky distilled
by the rough mountaineers.Being half-drunk all the time added intensity
to a naturally cruel, tyrannical disposition.One of the soldiers named Drake was a burly, red-faced fellow, who
seemed to be a boon companion of the captain; at least one took a drink
as often as the other.Another of the soldiers answered to the name of
Lyle; he was a gloomy, taciturn man, and said little.The remaining one
of Fred's captors was a mere boy, not older than himself.He was a
bright-eyed, intelligent looking fellow, tough and muscular, and from
his conversation vastly above the station in life of his comrades before
he enlisted.It was not long before Fred discovered that Captain Bascom
took delight in worrying the boy, whose name was Robert Ferror.In this
he was followed to a greater or less extent by Drake.Not only this,
but when they stopped for the night at the rude home of a mountaineer,
Fred noticed that Bob, as all called him, was the drudge of the party.He not only had to care for the captain's horse, but to perform menial
service, even to cleaning the mud from the captain's boots.As he was
doing this, Bob caught Fred looking at him, and coloring to the roots of
his hair, he trembled violently.It was evident that he felt himself
degraded by his work, but seeing a look of pity in Fred's eyes, he
fiercely whispered, "My mother's <DW65>s used to do this for me," and
then he cast such a look of hate on Captain Bascom that Fred shuddered.It was not until the evening of the second day of his capture that
Piketon was reached.Along in the afternoon, away to the left, firing
was heard, and every now and then, the deep boom of cannon reverberated
through the valleys and gorges.It made
Fred sick at heart to think that his friends were so near, and yet so
far.The knowledge that the Confederates were being driven seemed to anger
Bascom, and he drank oftener than usual.Noticing that Bob was talking
to Fred as they were riding along, he turned back and struck the boy
such a cruel blow in the face that he was knocked from his horse.By order of Bascom, Drake and Lyle dismounted, picked Bob up, wiped the
blood from his face, and after forcing some whisky down his throat,
placed him on his horse.At first he seemed dazed and could not guide
his horse.He gradually came to himself, and when he looked at Bascom
Fred saw that same murderous look come over his face which he had
noticed once before."Bascom has cause to fear that boy," thought Fred.When the party rode into Piketon they found everything in the utmost
confusion.Preparations were being made to evacuate the place.The
soldiers who had been in the fight came streaming back, bringing with
them their wounded and a few prisoners.They reported thousands and
thousands of Yankees coming.This added to the confusion and the
demoralization of the troops.The prisoners were thrown, for the night, in a building used as a jail.It was of hewn logs, without windows or doors, being entered through the
roof, access being had to the roof by an outside stairway, then by a
ladder down in the inside.When all were down, the ladder was drawn up,
and the opening in the roof closed.The place was indescribably filthy,
and Fred always wondered how he lived through the night.When morning
came and the ladder was put down for them to ascend, each and every one
thanked the Lord the rebels were to retreat, and that their stay in the
noisome hole was thus ended.With gratitude they drank in mouthfuls of
the fresh air.The whole place was in a frenzy of excitement.Commissary stores they
were not able to carry away were given to the flames.Every moment the
advance of Nelson's army was expected.But as time passed, and no army
appeared the panic somewhat subsided and something like order was
restored.That night, the retreating army camped in a pine forest at the base of a
mountain.Black clouds swept across the
sky, the wind howled mournfully through the forest, and the cold
pitiless rain chilled to the bone.Huge fires were kindled, and around
them the men gathered to dry their streaming clothes and to warm their
benumbed limbs.Just before the prisoners were made to lie down to sleep, the boy,
Robert Ferror, passed by Fred, and said in a low whisper:

"I will be on guard to-night.Was Robert Ferror going to aid him to escape?He
watched where the guard over the prisoners was stationed, and lay down
as close to him as possible.Soon he was apparently fast asleep, but he
was never wider awake.At eleven o'clock Robert Ferror came on guard.He
looked eagerly around, and Fred, to show him where he was slightly
raised his head.The boy smiled, and placed his finger on his lips.Slowly Ferror paced his beat, to and fro.Ferror's answer
was, "All is well."Another half-hour passed; still he paced to and
fro.After all, was Ferror to do nothing, or were his
words a hoax to raise false hopes?The camp had sunk to rest; the fires
were burning low.Then as Ferror passed Fred, he slightly touched him
with his foot.The next time Ferror passed
he stooped as if he had dropped something, and as he was fumbling on the
ground, whispered:

"Crawl back like a snake.About fifty yards to the rear is a large pine
tree.It is out of the range of the light of the fires.It would have taken a lynx's eye to
have noticed that one of the prisoners was missing, so silently had Fred
made his way back.One o'clock came, and Ferror was relieved.Five, ten, fifteen minutes
passed, and still Fred was waiting."I will wait a little longer," thought Fred, "and then if he does not
come, I will go by myself."Soon a light footstep was heard, and Fred whispered, "Here."A hand was stretched out, and Fred took it.It was as cold as death, and
shook like one with the palsy."He is quaking with fear," thought Fred."Have you got the revolver and cartridge belt?"asked Ferror, in a
hoarse whisper.He still seemed to be quaking as with ague.Silently Ferror led the way, Fred following.Slowly feeling their way
through the darkness, they had gone some distance when they were
suddenly commanded to halt.Ferror gave a start of surprise,
and then answered:

"A friend with the countersign.""Advance, friend, and give the countersign."Ferror boldly advanced, leaned forward as if to whisper the word in the
ear of the guard.Then there was a flash, a loud report, and with a moan
the soldier sank to the ground."Come," shrieked Ferror, and Fred, horrified, sprang forward.Through
the woods, falling over rocks, running against trees, they dashed, until
at last they had to stop from sheer exhaustion.Men
were heard crashing through the forest, escaping as they thought from an
unseen foe.But when no attack came, and no other shot was heard, the
confusion and excitement began to abate, and every one was asking, "What
is it?""The sound of the shot came from that direction," said the soldier who
had taken the place of Ferror as guard."There is where I stationed Drake," said the officer of the guard."I
discovered a path leading up the mountain, and I concluded to post a
sentinel on it.Sergeant, make a detail, and come with me."The detail was made, and they filed out in the darkness in the direction
that Drake was stationed."We must have gone far enough," said the officer."It was about here I
stationed him."It is not possible he has deserted, is
it?"He was groping around when he stumbled over something on the ground.He
reached out his hand, and touched the lifeless body of Drake.A cry of
horror burst from him.The body was taken up and carried back to camp.The officer bent over and examined it by the firelight."Shot through the heart," he muttered; "and, by heavens!Drake was shot not by some prowler, but by some one
inside the lines.The prisoners, who had all been aroused by the commotion, were huddled
together, quaking with fear.The sergeant soon reported: "Lieutenant, there is one missing; the boy
in citizen's clothes."Colonel Williams, who had been looking on with stern countenance, now
asked:

"Who was guarding the prisoners?"The colonel's tones were low and
ominous."Scott, sir," replied the sergeant of the guard."Colonel," said Scott, shaking so he could hardly talk, "before God, I
know nothing about the escape of the prisoner.I had not been on guard
more than ten or fifteen minutes before the shot was fired.Up to that
time, not a prisoner had stirred."I do not know whether he escaped before I came
on guard or after the alarm.The sergeant will bear me witness that
during the alarm I stayed at my post and kept the prisoners from
escaping.The boy might have slipped away in the confusion, but I do not
think he did."The sergeant soon returned with the information that Ferror could not be
found.He cast his eye over the group of officers
standing around him, and then suddenly asked: "Where is Captain Bascom?"The officers looked blank, then inquiringly into each other's faces.No
one had seen him during or since the alarm.The sergeant of the guard hurriedly went to a rude tent where the
captain slept.Pulling aside a blanket which served as a door he entered
the tent.A moment, and he reappeared with face as white as a sheet.his ashen lips shaped the words, but they died away in a
gurgle in his throat.Captain Bascom had been stabbed through the heart.The whole turmoil in camp was heard by Fred and Robert Ferror, as they
stood panting for breath.Fred shuddered as the horrified cry of the
officer of the day was borne to his ears when he stumbled on the dead
body of the guard.The boys were bruised and bleeding, and their
clothing was torn in shreds from their flight through the forest."It is all right now," said Ferror."They can never find us in the
darkness, but some of the frightened fools may come as far as this; so
we had better be moving."The boys slowly and painfully worked their way up the mountain, and at
last the roar of the camp was no longer heard.They came to a place
where the jutting rocks formed a sort of a cave, keeping out the rain,
and the ground and leaves were comparatively dry.The place was also
sheltered from the wind."Let us stay here," said Fred, "until it gets a little light.We can
then more easily make our way.We are entirely out of danger for
to-night."To this Ferror assented, and the two boys crept as far back as they
could and snuggled down close together.Fred noticed that Ferror still
trembled, and that his hands were still as cold as ice.The storm had ceased, but the wind sobbed and moaned through the trees
like a thing of life, sighing one moment like a person in anguish, and
then wailing like a lost soul.An owl near by added its solemn hootings
to the already dismal night.Fred felt Ferror shudder and try to creep
still closer to him.Both boys remained silent for a long time, but at
length Fred said:

"Ferror, shooting that sentinel was awful.I had almost rather have
remained a prisoner."I did not know the sentinel was there," answered Ferror, "or I could
have avoided him.As it was, it had to be done.It was a case of life or
death.Fred, do you know who the sentinel was?""It was Drake; I saw his face by the flash of my pistol, just for a
second, but it was enough.I can see it now," and he shuddered."No, Ferror; if I had been in your place, I might have done the same,
but that would have made it none the less horrible.""Fred, you will despise me; but I must tell you.""Drake is not the first man I have killed to-night."Fred sprang up and involuntarily drew away from him."After I was relieved from guard, and before I joined you, I stabbed
Captain Bascom through the heart."A low cry of horror escaped Fred's lips."Listen to my story, Fred, and then despise me as a murderer if you
will.My mother is a widow, residing in Tazewell county, Virginia.I am
an only son, but I have two lovely sisters.I was always headstrong,
liking my own way.Of course, I was humored and petted.When the war
broke out I was determined to enlist.My mother and sisters wept and
prayed, and at last I promised to wait.But about two months ago I was
down at Abingdon, and was asked to take a glass of wine.I think it was
drugged, for when I came to myself I found that I was an enlisted
soldier.Worse than all, I found that this man Bascom was an officer in
the company to which I belonged.Bascom is a low-lived, drunken brute.Mother had him arrested for theft
and sent to jail.When he got out, he left the neighborhood, but swore
he would have revenge on every one of the name.I think he was in hopes that by brutal treatment he could make me
desert, so he could have me shot if captured.When he struck me the
other day, when I spoke to you, I resolved then and there to kill him.""I know," replied Fred, in a low tone."God only knows what I have suffered from the hands of that man during
the last two months.I have had provocation enough to kill him a
thousand times.""I know, I know," replied Fred; "but to kill him in his sleep.I would
not have blamed you if you had shot him down when he gave you that blow."It would have been best," sobbed Ferror, for the first time giving way
to his feelings."Oh, mother, what will you think of your boy!"Then he
said, chokingly: "Fred, don't desert me, don't despise me; I can't bear
it.I believe if you turn from me now, I shall become one of the most
desperate of criminals.""No, Ferror," said Fred; "I will neither desert nor judge you.You have
done something I had rather lose my life than do.But for the present
our fortunes are linked together.If we are captured, both will suffer
an ignominious death.Therefore, much as I abhor your act, I cannot
divorce myself from the consequences.Then let us resolve, come what
may, we will never be taken alive."Ferror grasped Fred's hand, and pressing it fervently, replied: "If we
are captured, it will only be my dead body which will be taken, even if
I have to send a bullet through my own heart."After this the boys said little, and silently waited for the light.With the first gleam of the morning, they started on their way, thinking
only of getting as far as possible from the scene of that night of
horror.As the sun arose, the mountains and then the valleys were flooded with
its golden light.At any other time the glorious landscape spread out
before them would have filled Fred's soul with delight; but as it was,
he only eagerly scanned the road which ran through the valley, hoping to
catch sight of Nelson's advancing columns."They will surely come before long," said Fred."By ten o'clock we
should be inside of the Federal lines and safe."But if Fred had heard what was passing in the Rebel camp he would not
have been so sanguine.Lieutenant Davis, officer of the guard, and Colonel Williams were in
close consultation."Colonel," said the lieutenant, "I do not believe the Yankees are
pursuing us.Those boys will take it for granted that we will continue
our retreat, and will soon come down off the mountains into the road.Let me take a couple of companies of cavalry, and I will station men in
ambush along the road as far back as it is safe to go.In this way I
believe we stand a chance to catch them."The colonel consented, and, therefore, before the sun had lighted up the
valley, pickets had been placed along the road for several miles back.The boys trailed along the mountain side until nearly noon, but the
sides of the mountain were so seamed and gashed they made slow progress.Gaining a high point, they looked towards Piketon, and in the far
distance saw an advancing column of cavalry."There is nothing to be seen to the south," said Fred."I think we can
descend to the road in safety."So they cautiously made their way down
to the road."Let us look well to our arms," said Fred."We must be prepared for any
emergency."So their revolvers were carefully examined, fresh caps put in, and every
precaution taken.They came out on the road close to a little valley
farm.In front of the cabin stood a couple of horses hitched.After
carefully looking at the horses, Ferror said: "Fred, one of those horses
belongs to Lieutenant Davis.He has ridden back to see if he could not
catch sight of us.Nelson's men will soon send him back flying."Then a wild idea took possession of the boys.It was no less than to try
and get possession of the horses.Wouldn't it be grand to enter the
Federal lines in triumph, riding the horses of their would-be captors!Without stopping to think of the danger, they at once acted on the idea.From the cabin came sounds of laughter mingled with the music of women's
voices.Getting near the horses, the boys made a dash, were on their backs in a
twinkling, and with a yell of triumph were away.The astonished
officers rushed to the door, only to see them disappear down the road.Then they raged like madmen, cursing their fortunes, and calling down
all sorts of anathemas on the boys."Never mind," at last said Sergeant Jones, who was the lieutenant's
companion in misfortune, "the squad down the road will catch them.""Poor consolation for the disgrace of having our horses stolen," snapped
the lieutenant.The elation of the boys came to a sudden ending.In the road ahead of
them stood a squad of four horsemen.Involuntarily the boys checked the
speed of their horses.They looked into each other's faces, they read
each other's thoughts."It can only be death," said Fred."It can only be death," echoed Ferror, "and I welcome it.I know, Fred,
you look on me as a murderer.I want to show you how I can die in a fair
fight."Fred hardly realized what Ferror was saying; he was debating a plan of
attack."Ferror," he said, "let us ride leisurely forward until we get within
about fifty yards of them.No doubt they know the horses, and will be
nonplused as to who we are.It will be
all over in a moment--safety or death."He was as pale as his victims of the night before, but
his eyes blazed, his teeth were set hard, every muscle was strained.Just as Fred turned to say, "Now!"Ferror shouted, "Good-bye, Fred,"
and dashed straight for the horsemen.The movement was so sudden it left
Fred slightly behind.The revolvers of the four Confederates blazed, but
like a thunderbolt Ferror was on them.The first man and horse went down
like a tenpin before the ball of the bowler; the second, and boy and man
and both horses went down in an indistinguishable mass together.As for Fred, not for a second did he lose command of himself or his
horse.He saw what was coming, and swerved to the right.Here a single
Confederate confronted him.This man's attention had been attracted for
a moment to the fate of his comrades in the road, and before he knew it
Fred was on him.He raised his smoking revolver to fire, but Fred's
revolver spoke first, and the soldier reeled and fell from his saddle.The road was now open for Fred to escape, but he wheeled his horse and
rode back to see what had become of his comrade.One Confederate still
sat on his horse unhurt.Seeing Fred, he raised his pistol and fired.Fred felt his left arm grow numb, and then a sensation like that of hot
water running down the limb.Before the soldier could fire the second
time, a ball from Fred's pistol crashed through his brain, and he fell,
an inert mass, in the road.Of the two Confederates overthrown in the wild charge of Ferror, one was
dead, the other was untouched by bullets, but lay groaning with a
broken leg and arm.He lay partly
under his horse, his eyes closed, his bosom stained with blood.[Illustration: Fred raised his Head, "Ferror!"It's all right, Fred--all right,"
he gasped."That was no murder--that was a fair fight, wasn't it?""It is better as it is, Fred.He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was with a far-away
look."Yes, mother," he whispered, and then
his eyes closed forever.The clatter of horses' hoofs, and the clang of sabers were now heard.Fred looked up; a party of Federal cavalry was bearing down upon him.They looked on the bloody scene in astonishment.A dashing young captain
rode up.Fred pointed to young Ferror's lifeless body, and said: "Bring
his body back to Piketon with you.I am one of
General Nelson's scouts."Then everything grew black before him, and he knew no more.He had
fainted from the loss of blood.The rough troopers bound up his arm, staunched the flow of blood, and
soon Fred was able to ride to Piketon.General Nelson received him with
astonishment; yet he would not let him talk, but at once ordered him to
the hospital.As for Robert Ferror, he was given a soldier's burial.A year after the war closed, Frederic Shackelford, a stalwart young man,
sought out the home of Mrs.He found a gray-haired,
brokenhearted mother and two lovely young ladies, her daughters.They
had mourned the son and brother, not only as dead, but as forever
disgraced, for they had been told that Robert had been shot for
desertion.Fred gave them the little mementoes he had kept through the years for
them.He told them how Robert had given his life to try and save him,
and that the last word that trembled on his lips was "Mother."The gray-haired mother lifted her trembling hands, and thanked God that
her son had at least died the death of a soldier.Learning that the family had been impoverished by the war, when Fred
left, he slipped $1,000 in Mrs.Ferror's hand, and whispered, "For
Robert's sake;" and the stricken mother, through tear-dimmed eyes,
watched his retreating form, and murmured: "And Robert would have been
just such a man if he had lived."CRAZY BILL SHERMAN.The ball had gone through the
fleshy part of the arm, causing a great loss of blood; but no bones were
broken, and it was only a question of a few weeks before he would be as
well as ever.The story of the two boys charging four Confederate cavalrymen, killing
three, and disabling the fourth was the wonder of the army.But Fred
modestly disclaimed any particular bravery in the affair."It is to poor Bob Ferror that the honor should be given," he would say;
"the boy that knowingly rode to his death that I might be saved."Fred gave General Nelson the particulars of his capture and escape, and
the general looked grave and said:

"If I had known I was going to place you in such extreme danger, I
should not have sent for you.On account of the crime of young Ferror,
you would have met with a most ignominious death if you had been
recaptured; yet the charging on those four cavalrymen was one of the
pluckiest things I have heard of during the war.You deserve and shall
have a good rest.I have just finished making up some dispatches for
General Sherman, and you shall be my messenger.A dispatch boat leaves
in the morning, and you shall go with it.When you get to Catlettsburg,
you can take an Ohio river steamer for Louisville.The trip being all by
water, will be an easy one, and as a number of sick and wounded will be
sent away on the same boat, you will have good surgical attendance for
your wounded arm.Here is a paper that will admit you to the officers'
hospital when you get to Louisville.I do
not think it will be long before I, with my command, will be ordered
back to Louisville.The enemy has retreated through Pound Gap into
Virginia, and there is nothing more for me to do here.Stay in
Louisville until you hear from me."The next morning found Fred on his way down the Big Sandy.The whole
voyage was uneventful, and after a quick trip Fred once more found
himself in Louisville.The rest and quiet of the voyage had almost cured
the ill-effects of his experience, and with the exception of his wounded
arm, which he was compelled to carry in a sling, he was feeling about as
well as ever.Once in Louisville, he lost no time in turning over his dispatches to
General Sherman.He found the general surrounded by a delegation of the
prominent Union men of the city.They seemed to be arguing with Sherman
about something, and as for the general, he was in a towering rage, and
was swearing in a manner equal to General Nelson in one of his outbreaks
of anger.Fred was surprised to find the usually mild and gentlemanly officer in
such a passion, but there was no mistake, he was angry clear through."There is no use talking, gentlemen," he was saying, as he paced the
room with quick nervous tread, "I am not only going to resign, but I
have already sent in my resignation.I will not remain in command of the
Department of Kentucky another day; the command of the armies of the
United States would not induce me to remain and be insulted and outraged
as I have been.""We are very sorry to hear it, General," replied the spokesman of the
delegation."We had great hopes of what you would accomplish when you
were appointed to the command of the department, and our confidence in
you is still unabated.""I am thankful," replied the general, "for that confidence, but what can
you expect of a man bound hand and foot.They seem to know a great deal
better in Washington what we need here than we do who are on the ground.This, in a measure, is to be expected; but to be reviled and insulted is
more than I can stand.But if I had not resigned, I should be removed, I
know that.Just let the newspapers begin howling at a general, and
denouncing him, and every official at Washington begins shaking in his
boots.What can be expected of a general with every newspaper in the
land yelping at his heels like a pack of curs?If I wanted to end this
war quickly, I would begin by hanging every editor who would publish a
word on how the war should be conducted."Are you not a little too severe on the newspaper fraternity, General?"mildly put in one of the citizen delegates.They think
they know more about war, and how to conduct campaigns than all the
military men of the country combined.Not satisfied with telling me how
and when to conduct a campaign, they attack me most unjustly and
cruelly, attack me in such a manner I cannot reply.Just listen to
this," and the general turned and took up a scrapbook in which numerous
newspaper clippings had been pasted."Here is an editorial from that
esteemed and influential paper, _The Cincinnati Commerce_," and the
general read:

"'It is a lamentable fact that many of our generals are grossly
incompetent, but when incipient insanity is added to incompetency, it is
time to cry a halt.Right here at home, the general who commands the
Department of Kentucky and therefore has the safety of our city in his
hands, is W. T. Sherman.We have it on the most reliable evidence that
he is of unsound mind.Not only do many of his sayings excite the pity
of his friends and ridicule of his enemies, but they are positively
dangerous to the success of our cause.The Government should at least
put the department in charge of a general of sound mind.'"Now, if that is not enough," continued the general, with a touch of
irony in his tones, "I will give you a choice clipping from the great
_New York Tricate_."'It is with sorrow that we learn that General W. T. Sherman, who is in
command of the Department of Kentucky, is not in his right mind.It is
said that the authorities at Washington have been aware of this for some
time, but for political reasons fear to remove him.He is a brother of
John Sherman, one of the influential politicians of Ohio, and United
States Senator-elect.While the affair is to be regretted, the
Government should not hesitate on account of political influence.That he is mentally unsound
is admitted, even by his best friends.The whole company was smiling at the absurdity of the affair."I will read once more," said the general."It is from the _Chicago
Timer_, and hits others as well as myself.Here it is:

"'General Bill Sherman, in command of the Department of Kentucky, is
said to be insane.In our mind the whole Lincoln
Government, from President down, is insane--insane over the idea that
they can coerce the South back into the Union.The only difference that
we can see is that Bill Sherman may be a little crazier than the rest;
that's all.'"There," continued the general, "are only a few of the scores of
extracts which I have from the most influential papers in the land.Of
course the smaller papers have taken their cue from the larger ones, and
now the whole pack of little whiffets are after me, snapping at my
heels; and the good people believe the story because it is published.Hundreds of letters are being received at Washington, asking for my
removal.My brother writes that he is overwhelmed with inquiries
concerning me.I believe the War Department more than half believes I am
of unsound mind.They are only waiting for an excuse to get rid of me,
and I know that my resignation will be received with joy.""General," asked one of the citizens present, "have you any idea of how
the story of your insanity started?""When Secretary of War Cameron was here,
I laid before him the wants of Kentucky, and among other things said
that I needed 60,000 men for defensive work, but for offensive
operations I should need 200,000.The Secretary spoke of it as an
'insane request.'Some reporter got hold of it, and then it went.The
Secretary has never taken the pains to correct the impressions.""Were you not a little extravagant in your demands?"The politicians at Washington have never yet recognized
the magnitude of the war in which we are engaged.Then their whole life
is office, and they are afraid of doing something that will lose them a
vote.As for the newspapers, they would rather print a sensation than
have us win a victory.They have called me crazy so much they
have alarmed my wife," and the general again indulged in another burst
of anger.When he became calmer, he said: "Gentlemen, I thank you for
your expressions of sympathy and confidence.I trust my successor will
be more worthy than I," and he bowed the delegation out.The general noticed him, and asked: "Well, my
boy, what is it?Why, bless my soul, it's Fred Shackelford!"Yes, General, with dispatches," and he handed them to him."I will read them when I cool off a little; I have been rather warm.I
see your arm is in a sling; been in a skirmish?"The wound didn't amount to much; it is
nearly well.""You should be thankful it is no worse.Come in in the morning, Fred; I
will have the dispatches read by that time."Fred called, as requested, the next morning, and found the general calm
and courteous as ever."General Nelson writes good news," said Sherman."He reports he has
entirely driven the Rebels out of the valley of the Big Sandy.He also
tells me in a private letter of your capture and escape.He speaks of
the desperate conflict that you and your comrade had with four Rebel
cavalrymen.My boy, I shall keep my
eye on you.I surely should ask for your services myself if I were going
to remain in command of the department.""General, I am sorry to have you resign," answered Fred, hardly knowing
what to say.The general's face darkened, and then he answered lightly: "I do not
think they will be sorry at Washington."And they were not; his resignation was gladly accepted, and the general
who afterward led his victorious army to Atlanta, and then made his
famous march to the sea, and whose fame filled the world, retired under
a cloud.And the injustice of it rankled in his breast and imbittered
his heart for months.The general appointed to succeed Sherman was Don Carlos Buell, a
thorough soldier, and, like McClellan, a splendid organizer; but, like
that general, he was unsuccessful in the field, and during what is known
as the "Bragg-Buell campaign" in Kentucky in the fall of 1862, he
entirely lost the confidence of his soldiers.Buell's first attention was given to the organization of his army and
the drilling of his soldiers.His labors in this direction were very
successful, and the "Army of the Cumberland" became famous for its
_esprit de corps_.General Nelson, according to his predictions, was ordered back with his
command to Louisville.Fred, now entirely well, was greatly rejoiced to
once more see his old commander.But there was little prospect of active
service, for the division was ordered into camp for the purpose of
drilling and being perfected in military duties.Idleness was irksome to
Fred, so he asked and obtained permission to join General Thomas, and
remain until such time as Nelson might need his services.General Thomas gave Fred a most cordial reception.There was something
about the handsome, dashing boy that greatly endeared him to the staid,
quiet general.Just now, Fred's presence was very desirable, for
Zollicoffer was proving very troublesome, threatening first one point
and then another, and it was almost impossible to tell which place was
in the most danger.General Thomas' forces were greatly scattered,
guarding different points, and he feared that at some of these places
his troops might be attacked and overpowered.He had asked permission of
Buell time and again to be allowed to concentrate his forces and strike
Zollicoffer a telling blow, but each and every time had met with a
refusal.Instead of being allowed to concentrate his force, he was
ordered to move portions of his command here and there, and the orders
of one day might be countermanded the next.Being December, the roads
were in a horrible condition, and it was almost impossible to move
trains, so that his army was being reduced by hard service which did no
good.He would sit for
hours buried in thought or poring over maps.All this time, Zollicoffer was ravaging the middle southern counties of
Kentucky, threatening first London, then Somerset, then Columbia, then
some intermediate point.The outposts of the army were often attacked,
and frequent skirmishes took place.In the midst of this activity, Fred
found congenial employment.He was kept busy carrying dispatches from
one post to another, or on scouting expeditions, trying to gain
information of the movements of the enemy.He frequently met squads of
the enemy, and had many narrow escapes from capture; but the fleetness
of his horse always saved him.Of all General Thomas' scouts, Fred obtained the most valuable
information.While not venturing into the enemy's lines, he had a way of
getting information out of the inhabitants friendly to the South that
surprised even the general.Fred hardly ever made a mistake as to the
movements of the opposing army.If there was one thing that he loved more than another it was his horse.He had trained him to do anything that a horse could do.At a word he
would lie down and remain as motionless as if dead.He would go anywhere
he was told without hesitating, and his keen ear would detect the
presence of an enemy quicker than the ear of his master.Fred had also
perfected himself in the use of a revolver until he was one of the best
shots in the army.He could ride by a tree at full gallop, and put three
balls in a three-inch circle without checking his speed."My life," he would say, "may depend on my being able to shoot quickly
and accurately."On some of his scouts Fred would take a party with him, and there was
not a soldier who did not consider it one of the greatest honors to be
thus chosen.One day near the close of the year Fred was scouting with a picked
force of five men a few miles to the east and south of Somerset.As they
were riding through a piece of wood, Prince suddenly stopped, pricked up
his ears, listened a moment, and then turned and looked at his master,
as if to say, "Danger ahead!""To cover, boys," said Fred, in a low tone.The party turned aside into the wood, and was soon completely hidden
from view."Steady now," said Fred; "no noise.""Are you sure your horse is as wise as you think?""Perfectly sure; Prince never makes a mistake.The trampling of horses, and the jingling of sabers could plainly be
heard, and soon a party of nine Confederate cavalrymen came riding by.They had no thought of danger, and were laughing and talking, thinking
not that death lurked so near them."The old traitor lives right ahead," they heard one say."We will learn him to harbor East Tennessee bridge-burners," said the
leader with a coarse laugh."Will it be hanging or shooting, Sergeant?"It's such fun to see a Lincolnite hanging by the neck
and dancing on air.Never shoot a man if you can hang him, is my motto."Fred's men heard this conversation with lowering brows, and the
muttered curses were deep if not loud, and five carbines were raised,
but with a gesture Fred motioned them down.His men looked at him in
astonishment, and there was disappointment on every face.As soon as the Confederates were out of hearing, so it was safe to
speak, one of the men said with a sigh:

"Capt'in,"--the soldiers always called Fred captain when they were out
with him--"I would hev give five dollars for a shot.I would hev fetched
that feller that loved to see hangin', sure.""I have strict orders," replied Fred, "to avoid fighting when I am out
on these scouting expeditions.It is the part of a good scout never to
get into a fight except to avoid capture.A scout is sent out to get
information, not to fight; a conflict defeats the very object he has in
view.""That's so, capt'in, but it goes agin the grain to let them fellers
off.""I may have made a mistake," replied Fred, "in letting those fellows
off.Come to think about it, I do not like what they said."Worse than that, capt'in.""We will follow them up," said Fred, "as far as we can unobserved.You
remember we passed a pretty farmhouse some half a mile back; that may be
the place they were talking about.We can ride within three hundred
yards of it under cover of the forest."Riding carefully through the wood, they soon came in sight of the
place.Surely enough, the Confederates had stopped in front of the
house.Four of them were holding the horses, while the other five were
not to be seen.As they sat looking the muffled sound of two shots were
heard, and then the shrieking of women."Boys," said Fred, in a strained voice, "I made a mistake in not letting
you shoot.There are
nine of them; we are six.shouted every one, their eyes blazing with excitement."Then for God's sake, forward, or we will be too late!"for the frenzied
shrieks of women could still be heard.They no sooner broke cover, than the men holding the horses discovered
them, and gave the alarm.The five miscreants who were in the house came
rushing out, and all hastily mounting their horses, rode swiftly away.The Federals, with yells of vengeance, followed in swift pursuit; yet in
all probability the Confederates would have escaped if it had not been
for the fleetness of Prince.Fred soon distanced all of his companions,
and so was comparatively alone and close on the heels of the enemy.They noticed this, and conceived the idea that they could kill or
capture him.Fred was watching for this very
thing, and as they stopped he fired, just as the leader's horse was
broadside to him.Then at the word, Prince turned as quick as a flash,
and was running back.The movement was so unexpected to the Confederates
that the volley they fired went wild.As for the horse of the Confederate leader, it reared and plunged, and
then fell heavily, pinning its rider to the ground.Two of his men
dismounted to help him.When he got to his feet, he saw that Fred's
companions had joined him and that they all were coming on a charge.Now, boys, stand firm; there are only six of them.But it takes men of iron nerve to stand still and receive a charge, and
the Federals were coming like a whirlwind.The Confederates emptied their revolvers at close range, and then half
of them turned to flee.It was too late; the Federals were among them,
shooting, sabering, riding them down.When it was over, eight Confederates lay dead or desperately wounded.Of
the six Federals, two were dead and two were wounded.Only one
Confederate had escaped to carry back the story of the disaster.[Illustration: The Federals were among them, shooting, sabering, riding
them down.]One of the wounded Confederates lay groaning and crying with pain, and
Fred going up to him, asked if he could do anything for him.The man looked up, and then a scowl of hate came over his face.he groaned, and then with an oath said: "I will have
you if I die for it," and attempted to raise his revolver, which he
still clutched.As quick as a flash Fred knocked it out of his hand, and as quick one of
Fred's men had a revolver at the breast of the desperate Confederate.Fred knocked the weapon up, and the shot passed harmlessly over the head
of the wounded man."None of that, Williams," said Fred."We cannot afford to kill wounded
men in cold blood.""But the wretch would have murdered you, capt'in," said Williams, and
then a cry went up from all the men.Fred looked at the man closely, and then said: "You are Bill Pearson,
the man I struck with my riding-whip at Gallatin.""You miserable wretch," said Fred, contemptuously."By good rights I
ought to blow your brains out, but your carcass is not worth the powder.Just then Fred noticed a countryman who had been attracted by the sound
of the firing, and motioned to him to approach.He came up trembling,
and looked with wonder on the dead men and horses."My good man," said Fred, "here are some wounded men that should be
looked after.Can you not do it, or get word to their command?""I reckon I kin," slowly replied the countryman."Yes," replied Fred; "and this reminds me, boys, we had better get away
from here.We do not know how many of the enemy may be near."The wounds of the two Federals who had been hurt were bound up, and they
were helped on their horses.The bodies of the two dead were then
tenderly placed on two of the Confederate horses which were unhurt, and
the mournful cavalcade slowly moved away.Going back to the house which the Confederates had entered, a
distressing sight met their view.On a bed, the master of the house lay dead, shot to death by the
murderers.By the bedside stood the wife and two daughters, weeping and
wringing their hands.The face of the widow was covered with blood, and
there was a deep gash on her head where one of the wretches had struck
her with the butt of his revolver, as she clung to him imploring him not
to murder her husband.The pitiful sight drove Fred's men wild, and he had all that he could do
to prevent them from going back and finishing the wounded murderers."You did wrong, capt'in, in not letting me finish that red-handed
villain who tried to shoot you," said Williams.With broken sobs the woman told her story.Her husband had a brother in
East Tennessee, who had been accused by the Confederate authorities of
helping burn railroad bridges.He escaped with a number of Union men,
and was now a captain in one of the Tennessee regiments."They came here," said the woman, "and found my husband sick in bed, so
sick he could not raise a finger to help himself.They accused him of
harboring his brother, and of furnishing information, and said that they
had come to hang him, but as he was sick they would shoot him.And
then," sobbed the woman, "notwithstanding our prayers, they shot him
before our eyes.and the stricken wife broke
completely down, and the daughters hung over the body of their murdered
father, weeping as if their hearts would break.He told the sobbing women that he would at once
report the case, and have her husband's brother come out with his
company."We will also," said Fred, "leave the bodies of our two dead
comrades here.If you wish, I will send a chaplain, that all may have
Christian burial.And, my poor woman, your wrongs have been fearfully
avenged.Of the nine men in the party that murdered your husband, but
one escaped.said the women, raising their streaming eyes to
heaven.Even the presence of death did not take away their desire for
revenge.Such is poor human nature, even in gentle woman."War makes demons of us all," thought Fred.The story of that fight was long a theme around the camp fire, and the
three soldiers who survived never tired of telling it.As for Fred, he
spoke of it with reluctance, and could not think of it without a
shudder.Fifteen men never engaged in a bloodier conflict, even on the
"dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky.THE MEETING OF THE COUSINS.General Thomas sat in his headquarters at Lebanon looking over some
dispatches which Fred had just brought from General Schoepf at Somerset.His face wore a look of anxiety as he read, for the dispatches told him
that General Zollicoffer had crossed to the north side of the Cumberland
river and was fortifying his camp at Beech Grove."I may be attacked at any moment," wrote General Schoepf, "and you know
how small my force is.For the love of heaven, send me reinforcements."The general sat with his head bowed in his hands thinking of what could
be done, when an orderly entered with dispatches from Louisville.Thomas
opened them languidly, for he expected nothing but the old story of
keeping still and doing nothing.Suddenly his face lighted up; his whole
countenance beamed with satisfaction, and turning to Fred he said:

"My boy, here is news for us, indeed.General Buell has at last
consented to advance.He has given orders for me to concentrate my army
and attack Zollicoffer at the earliest possible moment.""General," he exclaimed, "I already see Zollicoffer defeated, and hurled
back across the Cumberland.""Don't be too sanguine, Fred," he said; "none of
us know what the fortune of war may be; we can only hope for the best.But this means more work for you, my boy.You will at once have to
return with dispatches to General Schoepf.Somerset must be held at all hazards.""I am ready to start this minute with such tidings," gayly responded
Fred."Prince, poor fellow, will have it the hardest, for the roads are
awful.""That is what I am afraid of," replied the general."I hope to be with
Schoepf within a week, but, owing to the condition of the roads, it may
take me much longer."Within an hour Fred was on his way back to Somerset.It was a terrible
journey over almost impassable roads; streams, icy cold, had to be
forded; but boy and horse were equal to the occasion, and in three days
reached Somerset.He
commenced his march from Lebanon on December 31st; it was January 18th
before he reached his destination.The
rain poured in torrents, and small streams were turned into raging
rivers.Bridges were swept away, and had to be rebuilt.The soldiers,
benumbed with chilling rain, toiled on over the sodden roads, cheerful
in the thought that they were soon to meet the enemies of their country.General Schoepf received the news of General Thomas' advance with great
satisfaction."If I can only hold on," he said, "until Thomas comes, everything will
be all right.""We must show a bold front, General," replied Fred, "and make the enemy
believe we have a large force.""It's the enemy that is showing a bold front nowadays," replied General
Schoepf, with a faint smile."They have been particularly saucy lately.They have in the last few days, cut off two or three small scouting
parties.But what worries me the most is that there is hardly a night
but that every man on some one of our picket posts is missing.There is
no firing, not the least alarm of any kind, but the men in the morning
are gone.It is a mystery we have tried to solve in vain.At first we
thought the men had deserted, but we have given that idea up.The men
are getting superstitious over the disappearance of so many of their
comrades, and are actually becoming demoralized.""General, will you turn this picket business over to me?""I have heard much of your ability in
ferreting out secret matters.Your success as a scout I am well
acquainted with, as you know.I hope you will serve me as well in this
matter of the pickets, for I am at my wits' end.""Well, General, to-morrow I will be at your service, and I trust you
will lose no more pickets before that time," and so saying Fred took his
leave, for he needed rest badly.The next morning, when Fred went to pay his respects to the general, he
found him with a very long face."Another post of four men disappeared
last night," he said."Well, General, if possible, I will try and
solve the problem, but it may be too hard for me.""Have you any idea yet how they are captured?"I must first look over the ground carefully, see how the
men are posted, talk with them, and then I may be able to form an idea."Fred's first business was to ride out to where the post had been
captured during the night.This he did, noting the lay of the ground,
carefully looking for footprints not only in front, but in the rear of
where the men had been stationed.He then visited all the picket posts,
talked with the men, learned their habits on picket, whether they were
as watchful as they should be--in fact, not the slightest thing of
importance escaped his notice.On his return from his tour of inspection, Fred said to General
Schoepf, "Well, General, I have my idea.""Your pickets have been captured from the rear, not the front.""I mean that some of the pickets are so placed that a wary foe could
creep in between the posts and come up in the rear, completely
surprising the men.I think I found evidence that the men captured last
night were taken in that way.I found, at least, six posts of which I
believe an enemy could get in the rear without detection, especially if
the land had been spied out.""You astonish me," said the general."But even if this is so, why does
not the sentinel give the alarm?""He may be in such a position that he dare not," answered Fred."That a double force be put on the posts, half to watch the rear.It
will be my business to-night to see to that.""Very well," replied General Schoepf."I shall be very curious to see
how the plan works, and whether your idea is the correct one or not.""I will not warrant it, General," replied Fred, "but there will be no
harm in trying."Just before night Fred made a second round of the picket posts, and
made careful inquiry whether any one of the posts had been visited
during the day by any one from the outside.All of the posts answered in the negative save one.The corporal of that
post said: "Why, a country boy was here to sell us some vegetables and
eggs.""Was he a bright boy, and did he seem to notice
things closely?""On the contrary," said the corporal, "he appeared to be remarkably dull
and ignorant.""Has the same boy been in the habit of selling vegetables to the
pickets?"Come to think about it, the corporal believed he had heard such a boy
spoken of.Then one of the men spoke up and said:

"You know Rankin was on the post that was taken in last night.He had a
letter come yesterday, and I took it out to him, and he told me of what
a fine supper they were going to have, saying they had bought some eggs
and a chicken of a boy."suddenly exclaimed the corporal, "that boy to-day walked to
the rear some little distance--made an excuse for going; he might not
have been such a fool as he looked.""Corporal, I will be here a little after dark
with a squad of men to help you keep watch.In the mean time keep a
sharp lookout.""That I will," answered the corporal."Do you think that boy was a
spy?"But if any
trouble occurs on the picket line to-night, it will be at this post."That night Fred doubled the pickets on six posts which he considered the
most exposed.But the extra men were to guard the rear instead of the
front.The most explicit instructions were given, and they were
cautioned that they were to let no alarm at the front make them relax
their vigilance in the rear.Thirty yards in the rear of the post where
he was to watch Fred had noticed a small ravine which led down into a
wood.It was through this ravine that he concluded the enemy would creep
if they should try to gain the rear of the post.Fred posted his men so
as to watch this ravine.To the corporal who had charge of the post, he
said:

"My theory is, that some one comes up to your sentinel, and attracts his
attention by pretending to be a friend, or perhaps a deserter.This, of
course, will necessitate the sentinel's calling for you, and naturally
attract the attention of every man awake.While this is going on, a
party that has gained the rear unobserved will rush on you and be in
your midst before you know it, and you will be taken without a single
gun being fired."said one, "I believe it could be done.""Now," continued Fred, "if you are hailed from the front to-night act
just as if you had not heard of this.When everything was prepared the soldiers, wrapped in their blankets,
sat down to wait for what might come.So intently did they listen that
the falling of a leaf would startle them.There was a half-moon, but dark clouds swept across the sky, and only
now and then she looked forth, hiding her face again in a moment.Once
in a while a dash of cold rain would cause the sentinels to shiver and
sink their chins deeper into the collars of their great coats.Midnight came, and still all was quiet.The soldiers not on guard lay
wrapped in their blankets, some of them in the land of dreams.Off in the woods the hoot of an owl was heard.A few minutes passed, and again the dismal "Whoo!Instantly they were all
attention, and every sense alert.whispered the sergeant, next to him."Nothing but the suspicious hooting of an owl," whispered back Fred.Then to the soldiers, "Perfectly still, men; not a sound."So still were they that the beatings of their hearts could be heard.Again the dismal hoot was heard, this time so near that it startled
them.Then from the sentinel out in front came the short, sharp challenge,
"Who comes there?""A deserter who wishes to come into the
lines and give himself up."The corporal went forward to receive the deserter.Now there came the
sound of swiftly advancing footsteps in front of the rear post, and dim
figures were seen through the darkness.Seven rifles belched forth their contents, and for a moment the flashes
of the guns lighted up the scene, and then all was dark.There were cries of pain, hoarse yells of surprise and anger, and then a
scattering volley returned."Use your revolvers," shouted Fred, and a rapid fire was opened.There were a few more
scattering shots, and all was still.The deserter, who was so anxious to give himself up, the moment the
alarm was given fired at the sentinel and vanished in the darkness.The sound of the firing created the wildest commotion in camp.The long
roll was beaten; the half-dressed, frightened soldiers came rolling out
of their tents, some without their guns, others without their cartridge
boxes; excited officers in their night clothes ran through the camp,
waving their bare swords and shouting: "Fall in, men, for God's sake,
fall in."It was some minutes before the excitement abated, and every one was
asking, "What is it?The officer of the day, with a strong escort, came riding out to where
the firing was heard.Being challenged, he gave the countersign, and
then hurriedly asked what occasioned the firing."Oh," cheerfully responded Fred, "they tried to take us in, and got
taken in themselves."An examination of the ground in front of where Fred's squad was
stationed revealed two Confederates still in death, and trails of blood
showed that others had been wounded."You can go to your quarters," said Fred to his men."You will not be
needed again to-night; and, Lieutenant," said he, turning to the officer
of the day, "each and every one of these men deserves thanks for his
steadiness and bravery.""I hardly think, General," said Fred, the next morning, as he made his
report, "that your pickets will be disturbed any more."As for General Schoepf, he was delighted, and could not thank Fred
enough.For three or four days things were comparatively quiet.Then a small
scouting party was attacked and two men captured.The next day a larger
party was attacked and driven in, with a loss of one killed and three
wounded.The stories were the same; the leader of the Confederates was a
young lieutenant, who showed the utmost bravery and handled his men with
consummate skill."I wish," said General Schoepf to Fred, "that you would teach this
young lieutenant the same kind of a lesson that you taught those fellows
who were capturing our pickets.""I can try, General, but I am afraid the job will not only be harder,
but much more dangerous than that one," answered Fred."This same young lieutenant," continued the general, "may have had a
hand in that picket business, and since he received his lesson there has
turned his attention to scouting parties.""In that case," replied Fred, "it will take the second lesson to teach
him good manners.Well, General, I will give it to him, if I can."The next morning, with eight picked men from Wolford's cavalry, Fred
started out in search of adventure."Don't be alarmed, General," said Fred, as he rode away, "if we do not
come back to-night.Many of their comrades, with longing eyes, looked after them, and wished
they were of the number; yet they did not know but that every one was
riding to death or captivity.Yet such is the love of adventure in the
human breast that the most dangerous undertakings will be gladly risked.After riding west about three miles Fred turned south and went about the
same distance.He then halted, and after a careful survey of the country
ahead, said: "I think, boys, it will be as well for us to leave the road
and take to the woods; we must be getting dangerously near the enemy's
country."The party turned from the road and entered a wood.Working their way
through this, skirting around fields, and dashing across open places,
after making a careful observation of the front, they managed to proceed
about two miles further, when they came near the crossing of two main
roads.Here they stopped and fed their horses, while the men ate their
scanty fare of hard bread and bacon.They had not been there long before a squadron of at least 200
Confederate cavalry came from the south, and turning west were soon out
of sight."I hardly think, boys," said Fred, "it would have paid us to try to take
those fellows into camp; we will let them go this time," and there was a
twinkle in his eye, although he kept his face straight."Just as you say, capt'in," replied one of the troopers, as he took a
chew of tobacco."We would have gobbled them in if you had said the
word."A little while after this a troop of ten horsemen came up the same road,
but instead of turning west they kept on north.At the head of the troop
rode a youthful officer.One of the soldiers with Fred was one of the number that had been
attacked and defeated two days before by the squad of which they were in
search."That's he, that's the fellow!"What he had come for, fate had thrown
in his way."If they were double, we would fight them," cried the men all together."Let them pass out of sight before we pursue," said Fred."The farther
we get them from their lines the better.""Now," said Fred, after they had waited about five minutes.A ride of a
few minutes more brought them into the road.Halting a moment, Fred
turned to his men and said:

"Men, I know every one of you will do your duty.All I have to say is
obey orders, keep cool, and make every shot count.With a cheer they followed their gallant young leader.After riding
about two miles, Fred reined up and said: "They have not dodged us, have
they, boys?We ought to have sighted them before this.Here is where we
turned off of the road.I believe they noticed that a squad
of horsemen had turned off into the woods, and are following the tracks.Let's see," and Fred jumped from his horse, and examined the tracks
leading into the woods."That's what they did, boys," said he, looking up."I will give that
lieutenant credit for having sharp eyes.Now, boys, we will give him a
surprise by following."They did not go more than half a mile before they caught sight of the
Confederates.Evidently they had concluded not to follow the tracks any
farther, for they had turned and were coming back, and the two parties
must have sighted each other at nearly the same moment.There was the sharp crack of a carbine, and a ball whistled over the
Federals' heads.The young lieutenant who led the Confederates was
far too careful a leader to charge an unknown number of men.Instead of
charging the Confederates dismounted, and leaving their horses in charge
of two of their number the rest deployed and advanced, dodging from tree
to tree, and the bullets began to whistle uncomfortably close, one horse
being hit."Dismount, and take the horses back," was Fred's order."We must meet
them with their own game."The two men who were detailed to take the
horses back went away grumbling because they were not allowed to stay in
the fight.Telling them to keep well covered, Fred advanced his men slightly, and
soon the carbines were cracking at a lively rate.But the fight was more noisy than dangerous, every man being careful to
keep a tree between himself and his foe."This can be kept up all day," muttered Fred, "and only trees and
ammunition will suffer.Orders were given to fall back to the horses, and the men obeyed
sullenly.A word from Fred, and their faces brightened.Mounting their
horses, they rode back as if in disorderly retreat.As soon as the Confederates discovered the movement, they rushed back
for their horses, mounted, and with wild hurrahs started in swift
pursuit of what they thought was a demoralized and retreating foe.Coming to favorable ground, Fred ordered his men to wheel and charge.So
sudden was the movement that the Confederates faltered, then halted.cried their young leader, spurring his horse on, but at that
moment a chance shot cut one of his bridle reins.The horse became
unmanageable, and running under the overhanging branches of a tree, the
gallant lieutenant was hurled to the ground.His men, dismayed by his
fall, and unable to withstand the impetuous onslaught of the Federals,
beat a precipitate retreat, leaving their commander and two of their
number prisoners in the hands of their foes.Two more of their men were
grievously wounded.Three of the Federals had been wounded in the mêlée.Fred dismounted and bent over the young lieutenant, and then started
back uttering an exclamation of surprise and grief.He had looked into
the face of his cousin, Calhoun Pennington.Hurriedly Fred placed his
hand on the fallen boy's heart.There was no sign of a
wound on his body.He has only been stunned by the fall," exclaimed Fred.In the mean time the five remaining Confederates had halted about a
quarter of a mile away, and were listening to what a sergeant, now in
command, was saying."Boys," he exclaimed, "it will be to our everlasting shame and disgrace
if we run away and leave the lieutenant in the hands of those cursed
Yankees.Some of them must be disabled, as well as some of us.Let us
charge and retake the lieutenant, or die to a man in the attempt.""Here is our hand on that, Sergeant," said each one of the four, and one
after the other placed his hand in that of the grim old sergeant.But just as they were about to start on their desperate attempt, they
were surprised to see Fred riding towards them, waving a white
handkerchief.When he came in hailing distance, he cried:

"Men, your gallant young leader lies over here grievously hurt.We are
going to withdraw," and wheeling his horse, he rode swiftly back.One of his men was so badly
wounded that he had to be supported on his horse; therefore their
progress was slow, and it was night before they reached camp.Fred made
his report to General Schoepf and turned over his two prisoners.The
general was well pleased, and extended to Fred and the soldiers with him
his warmest congratulations."If you had only brought in that daring young lieutenant with you your
victory would have been complete," said the general."I hardly think, General," said Fred, "that you will be troubled with
him any more.He was still insensible when we left, and with my three
wounded men and the two prisoners it was well-nigh an impossibility for
us to bring him in.""I know," replied the General, "and as you say, I think we have had the
last of him.""I sincerely hope so," was Fred's answer as he turned away, and it meant
more than the general thought.Fred had a horror of meeting his cousin
in conflict, and devoutly prayed he might never do so again.Every time he closed his eyes he could see the pale
face of his cousin lying there in the wood, and the thought that he
might be dangerously hurt, perhaps dead, filled him with terror."Why,"
he asked himself over and over again, "did the fortune of war bring us
together?"Let us return to the scene of the conflict, and see how Calhoun is
getting along.The Confederates received Fred's message with surprise."That lets us out of a mighty tough scrape," remarked the sergeant."We
must have hurt them worse than we thought.""Don't know about that," answered one of his men who was watching the
Federals as they retired."There is only one of them who appears to be
badly hurt; and they have poor Moon and Hunt in limbo, sure.""Better be prisoners than dead," answered the sergeant."But, boys, let
us to the lieutenant.It's strange the Yanks didn't try to take him
back."When they reached Calhoun, he was already showing signs of returning
consciousness, and in a few minutes he was able to sit up and converse."Then we whipped them after all," and his face lighted up with joy."Can't say that we did, Lieutenant," answered the sergeant; "but they
left mighty sudden for some reason."Calhoun looked around on his men with a troubled countenance."I see
only five of you," he said; "where are the rest?""Two are back nursing wounds," answered the sergeant."Sheldon is hit,
so hard hit I am afraid he is done for.As for Moon and Hunt, they have
gone off with the Yanks."The tears rolled down the cheeks of the young officer."Boys," he said,
chokingly, "I believe I have lost my grip.There was that last picket
affair that went against us, and now we are all broken up in a fair
combat.""Don't take on, Lieutenant," said the sergeant, soothingly."It was that
chance bullet that cut your bridle rein that did the business.If it
hadn't been for that we would have wiped them out, sure.As it is, we
are thankful they didn't take a notion to lug you off.""No, they didn't," replied the sergeant, and then he told Calhoun what
had happened."What kind of a looking man was the leader of the Yanks?""He was a boy, no older than yourself.He was mounted on a magnificent
bay horse with a star in the forehead."I see it all," sighed Calhoun."The leader of that party was my cousin,
Fred Shackelford.Boys, help me on my
horse.I am badly shaken up, but not seriously hurt.We will square
accounts with those fellows one of these days."And the little party, bearing their wounded, sadly wended their way back
to the Confederate camp.For the next few days the weather was so bad and the roads in such a
terrible condition that both armies were comparatively quiet.Nothing as
yet had been heard from the advance of General Thomas, and General
Schoepf began to be very uneasy.At last Fred offered to ride toward
Columbia, and see if he could not get some tidings of the missing
column.The offer was gladly accepted, and Fred set out.He met with no
adventure until about fifteen miles from Somerset, when he suddenly came
face to face with a young soldier, and he supposed a Federal, as he wore
a blue great coat.But a second look caused a cry of surprise to burst
from Fred's lips, and at the same time the supposed Federal soldier
snatched a revolver from the holster.The cousins were once more face to
face."Put up your revolver, Calhoun," cried Fred."Is that the way you greet
your cousin?"For a moment Calhoun gazed on Fred in silence, then raising his hand in
courtly salute, he suddenly turned his horse, and jumping him over a low
fence, disappeared in a copse of wood.Fred was on the point of raising his voice to call him back, when it
flashed upon him that Calhoun had been playing the spy, and that he dare
not stop, even for a moment."He was only stunned after all, when he was hurled from his horse,"
thought Fred."I am so glad; a heavy load has been lifted from my mind.It would have been extremely awkward for
me to have found out he was a spy, and then let him go."It was with a lighter heart that he pursued his journey, but he had gone
but a short distance when he met a courier from General Thomas with
dispatches for General Schoepf.He was informed that the advance of
General Thomas was but a short distance in the rear.A few moments more
and Fred was in the presence of his general.said Thomas, "I am glad to see you."All right, General, only General Schoepf has been sorely worried over
your non-appearance."The march has been an awful one, and has taken three
times as long as I expected.But we will be at Logan's Cross Roads
to-night, where I shall halt to concentrate my army.If the enemy does
not retreat, we may look for a lively time in about three days.""The lively time, General, may come before three days," answered Fred,
significantly."The Rebels may conclude," answered Fred, "to attack you before you can
bring up the rest of your force, or get aid from Somerset.Fishing Creek
is very high; I had to swim it.It will be almost impossible to get
infantry or artillery over.""I have thought of that," replied the general, smiling."I shall try and
be ready for them if they come."Fred was right in his surmise that Calhoun had been acting the part of a
spy.He had been playing a very dangerous game, and had been successful.Disguised as a country boy, he had boldly entered Columbia, and in a
great measure had fathomed the plans of General Thomas.It was a matter
of common report that as soon as the army could be concentrated, General
Zollicoffer would be attacked.Calhoun had made a careful estimate of
the strength of Thomas' army, and when met by Fred he was taking an
observation of his order of march, and how long it would take the rear
brigade to reinforce the advance brigade, if it should be attacked.The sudden meeting with Fred was a surprise to him.But when he heard
Fred's voice he knew his life was in no danger; yet he dare not tarry,
even for a moment, and so escaped as we have seen.No sooner was he out of sight of Fred than he checked his horse."That
was a lucky escape," he said to himself."If I had to meet any one, it
was fortunate I met Fred.I would so much like to have a talk with him, but it would have been
madness to have stopped, and then it would have placed him in a very
awkward predicament.Selim, old boy," continued he, patting his horse's
neck, "we have work yet before us; we must see where General Thomas
camps."It was early on the morning of January 18th that Calhoun rode into the
Confederate camp at Beech Grove.Without changing his mud-bespattered
garments, he at once sought the quarters of Major-General G. B.
Crittenden, who had been placed in chief command of the army."Ah, Lieutenant," exclaimed the general, "I am glad to see you.I have
been thinking of you, and blaming myself for permitting you to go on
your hazardous adventure.He who acts as a spy takes his life in his
hands.""It is an old saying that 'all is well that ends well,'" Calhoun
answered, smiling."You ought to have seen what a splendid country
bumpkin I made; and I have succeeded beyond my most sanguine
expectations.I have very important news for you, General.General
Thomas is now encamped at Logan's Cross Roads, only ten miles away.He
will wait there for his rear brigade, and also for reinforcements from
Somerset.He has only one brigade with him, numbering not much over
4,000 men."Calhoun then went on and gave General Crittenden the full details of the
strength of the Federal army, saying that he thought the rear brigade
of Thomas' army could not reach Logan's Cross Roads for at least two
days, and that owing to the height of water in Fishing Creek he believed
it impossible for Thomas to receive reinforcements from Somerset."If these forces all combine, General," continued Calhoun, "they will so
far outnumber us that it would be madness to risk a battle.To-morrow
Thomas will be isolated; his force is inferior to yours."You think that your information as to numbers and position is
absolutely correct, do you?""I do, General," answered Calhoun."If you attack General Thomas in the
morning I am confident you will attack with a superior force.""It is either that or a disastrous retreat," said the general, gravely."I will call a council of my officers at once."As soon as I can get off some of this mud I will be ready," answered
Calhoun.The council was called, and General Crittenden laid the facts before his
officers.Calhoun was asked a great many questions, to all of which he
gave full and sufficient answers.The council, without a dissenting
voice, voted to attack Thomas the next morning.It was nearly midnight when the Confederates marched out of their
entrenchments, General Zollicoffer's brigade having the advance.Calhoun acted as aid on the staff of General Crittenden.The distance,
ten miles, made a fearful night march, considering the roads.Calhoun
afterwards said that it was one of the worst marches he ever made.A cold drizzling rain fell that chilled the
soldiers to the very bone.Through the rain and the mud for hour after
hour the brave men of the Confederacy toiled on, animated by the hope
that they would soon meet and hurl back in inglorious defeat the men
whom they considered ruthless invaders of their soil.It took nearly
seven hours to march that ten miles, every step being taken through mud
and water, sometimes nearly knee deep.Just as the gray shadows in the east betokened the ushering in of the
short January day, the crack!of guns in front told that the
Federal pickets had been alarmed.The sharp reports of those guns as
they echoed back along the mud-stained ranks caused the weary soldier to
forget his weariness.The cold was no longer felt, the excitement of the
coming battle sent the blood tingling through the veins.It is time to turn now to General Thomas and his little army that lay
encamped at Logan's Cross Roads in the darkness and shadows of that
gloomy night.Couriers had been sent back to hurry up the rear brigade;
orders had been sent to General Schoepf to at once forward three
regiments, but General Thomas well knew if he was attacked in the
morning none of these reinforcements would reach him.The general sat in his tent, listening to Fred giving an account of what
had happened at Somerset during the three weeks he had been there.He
was especially interested in the account Fred gave of his picket fight."That, Shackelford," said the general, "was strategy worthy of a much
older head.Your little fight was also admirably managed.""I had rather it had been against any one than my cousin," answered
Fred."Such things cannot be avoided," answered Thomas, with a sigh.I am a Virginian, and must fight against those who are
near and dear to me."Fred did not answer; he was thinking of his father.The general sat as if buried in deep thought for a moment, and then
suddenly looking up, said:

"Shackelford, you know when we were going into camp this evening that
you said you feared an attack in the morning.""I am almost positive of it, General," was Fred's reply."Because the enemy is well posted and must know that you mean to attack
them when your forces are consolidated, and your army will be so strong
they cannot hope to stand before it.I am also of the opinion that they
are well informed of your isolated position here; that one of your
brigades is two days' march in the rear, also that owing to the high
stage of water in Fishing Creek it will be impossible for General
Schoepf to reinforce you for a day or two.I also believe that the enemy
has a fair estimate of your exact strength."During this speech of Fred's the general listened intently, and then
said: "You have a better idea of my actual position than I trust most of
my officers have, but you said some things which need explaining.On
what grounds do you base your belief that the enemy are so well
acquainted with my situation and strength?""No positive proof, General, but an intuition which I cannot explain.But this impression is also based on more solid ground than intuition.Yesterday, just before I met your advance, I met a man in our uniform.When he saw me he jumped his horse over a fence and disappeared in a
wood.To-day I caught a glimpse of
that same man in the woods yonder on our right."Thomas mused a moment, and then said: "If the Confederate general fully
knows our situation and strength, he is foolish if he does not attack
me.But if he does, I shall try and be ready for him."The general then once more carefully examined his maps of the country,
gave orders that a very strong picket should be posted, and that well in
advance of the infantry pickets cavalry videttes should be placed, and
that the utmost vigilance should be exercised.Then turning to Fred, he said: "If your expectations are realized in the
morning, you may act as one of my aids.And now, gentlemen," said he,
turning to his staff, "for some sleep; we must be astir early in the
morning."In the gray light of the early morning, from away out in front, there
came the faint report of rifles.Early as it was, General Thomas and staff had had their breakfast, and
every soldier was prepared.General Manson, in command of the advance regiments, came galloping back
to headquarters."General," he said, "we are attacked in force.""Go back," replied General Thomas, without betraying any more excitement
than if he were ordering his men out on review, "form your men in the
most advantageous position, and hold the enemy until I can bring up the
rest of the troops."In a trice aids were galloping in every direction.The fitful reports of guns in front had become a steady roll of
musketry.The loud mouth of the cannon joined in, and the heavy
reverberations rolled over field and through forest.In an incredibly
short time every regiment was in motion towards where the heavy smoke of
battle was already hanging over the field.Of all the thousands, the general commanding seemed the most
unconcerned.He leisurely mounted his horse and trotted toward the
conflict.His eye swept the field, and as the regiments came up they
were placed just where they were needed.His manner inspired every one
who saw him with confidence.To Fred the scene was inexpressibly grand.The
wild cheering of men, the steady roll of musketry, the deep bass of
cannon, thrilled him with an excitement never felt before.The singing
of the balls made strange music in his ears.Now and then a shell or
solid shot would crash through the forest and shatter the trees as with
a thunderbolt.Soon a thin line of men came staggering back, some
holding up an arm streaming with blood, others hobbling along using
their guns as crutches.A few, wild with fear, had thrown away their
guns, and were rushing back, lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but an insane desire to get out of that hell of fire.At first there was a lump in the throat, as if
the heart was trying to get away, a slight trembling of the limbs, a
momentary desire to get out of danger, and then he was as cool and
collected as if on parade.Through the storm of balls he rode,
delivering his orders with a smiling face, and a word of cheer.General
Thomas noticed the coolness of his aid, and congratulated him on his
soldierly qualities.On the left, in front of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, the battle was
being waged with obstinate fury.Colonel Fry, seeing Fred, rode up to
him, and said: "Tell General Thomas I must have reinforcements at once;
the enemy is flanking me.""Say to Colonel Fry," said Thomas, "that I will at once forward the aid
required.Until the reinforcements come, tell him to hold his position
at all hazards."Fry compressed his lips, glanced along his
line, saw the point of greatest danger, and quickly ordered two of his
left companies to the right, leading them in person, Fred going with
him.An officer enveloped in a large gray coat suddenly rode out of the wood,
and galloping up to them shouted: "For God's sake, stop firing!You are
firing on your own men."Just then two other officers rode up to the one in a gray cloak.Seeing
Colonel Fry and Fred, they at once fired on them.Colonel Fry was
slightly wounded, but Fred was untouched.As quick as thought both
returned the fire.The officer at whom Fred fired reeled in his saddle,
then straightened up and galloped to the rear.Colonel Fry fired at the
officer in the gray cloak.He threw up his arms, and then plunged
headlong to the ground.The bullet from Colonel Fry's pistol had pierced the heart of General
Zollicoffer.The battle now raged along the entire line with great fury.The lowering
clouds grew darker, and the pitiless rain, cold and icy, fell on the
upturned faces of the dead.The cruel storm beat upon the wounded, and
they shivered and moaned as their life's blood ebbed away.The smoke
settled down over the field and hid the combatants from view, but
through the gloom the flashes of the guns shone like fitful tongues of
flame.Then the Federal line began to press forward, and soon the whole
Confederate army was in full retreat.[Illustration: The Battle now raged along the entire line with great
fury.]It was at this time that Fred's attention was attracted to a young
Confederate officer, who was trying to rally his men.Bravely did he
strive to stay the panic, but suddenly Fred saw him falter, sway to and
fro, and then fall.Once more did the Confederates try to rally under
the leadership of a young mounted officer, but they were swept aside,
and the battle was over.Fred's first thought was for the young Confederate officer whom he saw
fall while trying to rally his men.There was something about him that
seemed familiar.Fred's heart stood still at the
thought.He was lying on his
side, his head resting on his left arm, his right hand still grasping
his sword, a smile on his face.As Fred looked on the placid face of the
dead, a groan burst from him, and the tears gushed from his eyes.With
his handkerchief he wiped away the grime of battle, and there, in all
his manly beauty, Bailie Peyton lay before him.Fred's thoughts flew
back to that day at Gallatin.No more would those eloquent lips hold
entranced a spellbound audience.No more would his fiery words stir the
hearts of his countrymen, even as the wind stirs the leaves of the
forest.Tenderly did Fred have him carried back and laid by the side of his
fallen chieftain.As soon as
possible the remains of both were forwarded through the lines to
Nashville.It was not the city that Fred saw in August.Then it was wild and
hilarious with joy, carried away with the pomp and glory of war.Zollicoffer was the idol of the people of Tennessee; Bailie Peyton of
its young men.That both should fall in the same battle plunged
Nashville in deepest mourning.When the bodies arrived, it was a city of tears.Flags floated at
half-mast; women walked the streets wringing their hands and weeping
bitter tears.She was to drink
still deeper of the bitter cup of war.Back over the ten miles that they had marched through the darkness and
rain, the Confederate army fled in the wildest confusion.Swift in
pursuit came the victorious army of Thomas.Before night his cannon were
shelling the entrenchments at Beech Grove.There was no rest for the
hungry, weary, despondent Confederates.In the darkness of the night
they stole across the river, and then fled, a demoralized mob, leaving
everything but themselves in the hands of the victors.The next morning an officer came to Fred and said one of the prisoners
would like to see him."One of the prisoners would like to see me," asked Fred, in surprise."I don't know," answered the officer."But he is a plucky chap; it's the
young lieutenant who headed the last rally of the Rebs.He fought until
he was entirely deserted by his men and surrounded by us; he then tried
to cut his way out, but his horse was shot and he captured.""It must be Calhoun," and he rushed to
where the prisoners were confined.And the boys were in each other's arms."Cal, you don't know how glad I am to see you," exclaimed Fred.answered Calhoun, with a dash of his old spirits."No," said Fred; "like St.Paul, I will say 'except these bonds.'But
Calhoun, I must have a good long talk with you in private.""Not much privacy here, Fred," said Calhoun, looking around at the crowd
that was staring at them.Fred went to General Thomas and told him that his cousin was among the
prisoners, and asked permission to take him to his quarters.The
permission was readily given, and the boys had the day and night to
themselves.How they did talk, and how much they had to tell each other!First Fred
had to tell Calhoun all about himself.When he had finished Calhoun grasped his hand and exclaimed: "Fred, I am
proud of you, if you are fighting with the Yanks.How I would like to
ride by your side!But of all your adventures, the one with poor Robert
Ferror touches me deepest.He must
have had a great deal of pure gold about him, notwithstanding his
cowardly crime.""He did," sighed Fred, "he did; and yet I can never think of the
assassination of Captain Bascom without a shudder.On the other hand, I
can never think of Ferror's death without tears.As I think of him now,
I am of the opinion that the indignities heaped upon him had, in a
measure, unbalanced his mind, and that the killing of Bascom was the act
of an insane person.But, Cal, I hate to talk about it; that night of
horrors always gives me the shivers."There is not much to tell," answered Calhoun."You know I left Danville
with your father for Bowling Green.Owing to the influence of my father,
I was commissioned a second lieutenant and given a place on the staff of
Governor Johnson.You know a provisional State government was organized
at Bowling Green, and G. M. Johnson appointed Governor.When General
Buckner tried to capture Louisville by surprise, and you objected by
throwing the train off the track, I was one of the victims of the
outrage.I recognized you, just as your father ordered the volley
fired."did he order that volley fired at
me?""Yes; but he did not know it was you when he gave the order.When I
called out it was you, he nearly fainted, and would have fallen if one
of his officers had not caught him.He wanted to resign then and there,
but General Buckner would not hear of it.Really, Fred, I think he would
have ordered that volley even if he had known you; but if you had been
killed, he would have killed himself afterward.""He loves me even if he has disowned me.""Well," continued Calhoun, "to make a long story short, I became
prodigiously jealous of you.You were covering yourself with glory while
I was sitting around doing nothing.As Zollicoffer appeared to be the only one of the Confederate generals
who was at all active, I asked and received permission to join him,
where I was given a roving commission as a scout.If I do say it, I made
it rather lively for you fellows.At length I hit upon a nice little
plan of capturing your pickets, and was quite successful until you found
it out and put an end to my fun.""Calhoun," exclaimed Fred, in surprise, "was it you with whom I had that
night fight?""It was, and you came near making an end of your hopeful cousin, I can
tell you.Out of seven men, I had two killed and four wounded.Only one
man and myself escaped unhurt, and I had three bullet holes through my
clothes.That put an end to my raids upon your pickets, and I confined
myself to scouting once more.Then came that unlucky fight with you in
the woods.Fred, I must congratulate you on the way you managed that.Your retreat showed me your exact strength, and I thought I could wipe
you off the face of the earth.Your sudden wheel and charge took us
completely by surprise, and disconcerted my men.That shot which cut my
bridle rein took me out of the fight, and perhaps it was just as well
for me that it did.When I came to and found out what had been done, I
at once knew you must have been in command of the squad, and if I could
I would have hugged you for your generosity.""Cal," replied Fred, his voice trembling with emotion, "you can hardly
realize my feelings when I saw you lying pale and senseless there before
me; it took all the fight out of me.""I know, I know," answered Calhoun, laying his hand caressingly on
Fred's shoulder."I was badly shaken up by that fall, but not seriously
hurt.Now, comes the most dangerous of my adventures.When I met you in
the road, I----"

"Stop!"broke in Fred, "not another word.Of course you were on one of
your scouting expeditions."A curious look came over Calhoun's face, and then he said, in a low
voice: "You are right, Fred; I was on one of my scouting expeditions,"
and he shuddered slightly."Fred," suddenly asked Calhoun, "is there any possible way for me to
keep from going to prison?""Sometimes prisoners give their parole," answered Fred."I will see what
can be done."The next morning General Thomas sent for Fred, and said that he was
about to send some dispatches to General Buell at Louisville."And,"
continued he, "owing to your splendid conduct and the value of the
services you have rendered, I have selected you as the messenger.Then,
in all probability, it will be very quiet in my front for some time,
and General Nelson may have more active work for you.You know," he
concluded with a smile, "I only have the loan of you."Fred heartily thanked the general for the honor bestowed, and then said:
"General, I have a great boon to ask.""You know my cousin is here a prisoner.He is more like a brother than a
cousin--the only brother I ever knew.The boon I ask is that you grant
him a parole."Calhoun was sent for, and soon stood in the presence of the general."An officer, I see," said the general, as he glanced Calhoun over."Yes, sir; Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Governor Johnson's staff,"
answered Calhoun, with dignity."What were you doing up here if you are one of Johnson's staff?""Lieutenant, your cousin has asked as a special favor that you be
granted a parole.He says that you reside in Danville, and as he is
going to Louisville, he would like to have you accompany him as far as
your home.""General," answered Calhoun, "you would place me under a thousand
obligations if you would grant me a parole; but only on one condition,
and that is that you effect my exchange as quickly as possible.""I see," said he, "that you and Shackelford are
alike; never satisfied unless you are in the thickest of the fray.The parole was made out, and Fred and Calhoun made preparations to start
for Danville.Never did two boys enjoy a ride more than they did.In spite of bad roads and bad weather, the exuberance of their spirits
knew no bounds.They were playmates again, without a word of difference
between them.As far as they were concerned, the clouds of war had
lifted, and they basked in the sunlight of peace."I say, Fred," remarked Calhoun, "this is something like it; seems like
old times.Why did this war have to come and separate us?""The war, Calhoun," he answered, "has laid a heavier hand
on me than on you, for it has made me an outcast from home.""Don't worry, Fred; it will come out all right," answered Calhoun,
cheerily.On the morning of the second day the boys met with an adventure for
which they were not looking.Even as early in the war as this, those
roving bands of guerrillas which afterward proved such a curse to the
border States began to appear.It was somewhat of a surprise to the boys
when four men suddenly rode out of the woods by the side of the road,
and roughly demanded that they give an account of themselves."By my authority," answered the leader, with a fearful oath."And your authority I refuse to acknowledge," was the hot answer."See here, young man, you had better keep a civil tongue in your head,"
and as the leader said this he significantly tapped the butt of his
revolver."I wish to know who you are, and where you are going, and that ----
quick.""That is easily answered," replied Calhoun."As you see by my uniform, I
am a Confederate officer.I am on parole, and am on my way to my home in
Danville, there to wait until I am regularly exchanged.""And I suppose your companion is also
in the Confederate service.""Not at all," replied Fred, quietly."I am in the service of the United
States.""I think both of you are
Lincolnites.We will have to search you, and I think in the end shoot
you both.""Here is my parole," said Calhoun, his face growing red with anger.The man took it, glanced it over, and then coolly tore it in two, and
flung it down."Any one can carry such a paper as that.We
want them horses, and we want you.Boys, it will be fun to try our
marksmanship on these youngsters, won't it?"and he turned to his
companions with a brutal laugh.But the guerrillas made a great mistake; they thought they were only
dealing with two boys, and were consequently careless and off their
guard.With a sharp, quick look at Calhoun which meant volumes, Fred quickly
drew his revolver.There was a flash, a report, and the leader of the
guerrillas dropped from his horse.With a startled oath, the others drew
their revolvers, but before they could raise them there were two reports
so close together as almost to sound as one, and two more of the gang
rolled from their horses.The remaining one threw up his hands and began
to beg for mercy.[Illustration: Fred drew his Revolver, and the Guerrilla dropped from
his horse.]"You miscreant you," exclaimed Calhoun, covering him with his revolver."I ought to send a ball through your cowardly carcass, to be even with
my cousin here; for he got two of you, while I only got one.""You have; then so much the worse for the wife and children.""I am not fit to die," he blubbered."That is plain to be seen," answered Calhoun."Now hand me your weapons--butts first, remember.""Now pick up that parole your leader tore and threw down, and hand it to
me."Calhoun sat eyeing him a moment, and then continued: "I ought to shoot
you without mercy, but I believe in giving a dog a chance for his life,
and so I will give you a chance.You mount your horse, and when I say
'Go,' you go.After I say 'Go' I shall count five, and then shoot.If I
miss you, which I don't think I shall, I shall continue shooting as long
as you are in range; so the faster you go, the better for you.The man looked appealingly at Calhoun, but seeing no mercy, mounted his
horse as quick as his trembling limbs would let him.His face was white
with fear, and his teeth fairly rattled they chattered so.Calhoun reined his horse around so he was by the fellow's side.The man gave a yell of terror, bent low over his horse's neck and was
off like a shot.Calhoun with a chuckle fired over him, and the fellow
seemed to fairly flatten out.Four times did Calhoun fire, and at each
report the flying horseman appeared to go the faster.As for Fred, he was convulsed with merriment, notwithstanding the
grewsome surroundings."Leave these carrion where they are," said Calhoun in response to a
question from Fred as to what disposition they should make of the dead."That live companion of theirs will be back when we are gone."They rode along in silence for a while, and then Calhoun suddenly said:
"Fred, how I wish I could always fight by your side.It's a pity we have
to fight on different sides.""Just what I was thinking of, Cal," answered Fred; "but we have the
satisfaction of knowing we have fought one battle together.""And won it, too," shouted Calhoun.They reached Danville in due time and without further adventure.To say
that Judge Pennington was surprised to see them riding up together would
be to express it mildly; he was astounded.Then he had his arms around
his boy, and was sobbing, "My son!"And Fred, too," said the judge, at last turning from welcoming his son."I am truly glad to see you, my boy.But how in the world did you two
happen to come together?"And so the whole story had to be told, and the judge listened and
wondered and mourned over the defeat of the Confederates at Mill
Springs."My boy," said the judge, with tears glistening in his eyes, "at least I
am glad to know that you did your duty.""If all the Confederates had
been like Calhoun, we might not have won the victory.""Unless all the Federals had been like you," responded Calhoun
gallantly.The judge would have both boys tell him the full particulars of their
adventures, and listened to their recital with all the pleasure of a
schoolboy.But when they were through, he shook his head sadly, and
said: "Boys, you can't keep that pace up.But I
am proud of you, proud of you both, if Fred is fighting for that
horrible Lincoln."It was a happy day Fred spent at his uncle's.If bitterness was felt towards him it was not shown.When it was noised about that both Calhoun and Fred had returned, they
were besieged with callers.The story of the battle of Mill Springs had
to be told again and again.Colonel Fry was one of the influential
citizens of the city, and especially were they eager to hear the
particulars of his killing General Zollicoffer.Fred concluded to ride his horse to Louisville, instead of riding to
Nicholasville or Lebanon and taking the cars from one of those places."I must have Prince wherever I go after this," he said.asked General Nelson, as Fred rode up to
his headquarters after a very prosaic journey of three days."It is no one else, General," laughed Fred, as he dismounted."Here I
am, here is my good horse, Prince, and here is a letter to you from
General Thomas."Nelson took the letter, read it, and looking up smiling, said: "I see
you still keep up your habit of doing something unusual.Thomas speaks
in the highest terms of your work.the first real victory we have
gained."Yes, General; I have voluminous dispatches for General Buell.I was so
eager to see you I stopped before delivering them.""Ah, my boy, I believe you do think something of bluff old Nelson after
all, even if he has a devil of a temper," and the general kindly patted
the boy on the head."You know, General," he said, brokenly,
"that you took me in, when my father cast me out.""For the good of the country, my boy, for the good of the country," said
the general brusquely."But, come, Fred, I will ride over to General
Buell's headquarters with you.I would like to see General Thomas' full
report of the battle."They found General Buell in the highest of spirits, and Fred was given a
warm welcome.He looked over General Thomas' report, and his whole face
beamed with satisfaction.He asked Fred a multitude of questions, and
was surprised at the knowledge of military affairs which he showed in
his answers."I think, General," said General Buell, turning to Nelson, after he had
dismissed Fred, "that you have not overestimated the abilities of your
protégé.In a private note General Thomas speaks in the highest terms of
him."Somehow I have taken wonderfully to
the boy."What it was General Buell was to do for Fred, that individual was in
ignorance.While in Louisville many of Fred's leisure moments were spent at the
hospitable home of the Vaughns.Mabel's betrothed was now at the front,
and it was astonishing how much note paper that young lady used in
writing to him."You don't write that often to your brother," said Fred, smiling.asked Mabel, looking up in surprise."Yes, your humble servant; didn't you adopt me as a brother?"she replied, "one doesn't have to write
so often to a brother.Lovers are like babies; they have to be petted.But to change the subject, where does my knight-errant expect to go for
his next adventure?""Things appear to be rather quiet just
now."But events were even then transpiring that were to take Fred to a
different theater of action.Commodore Foote and General U. S. Grant sat conversing in the
headquarters of the latter at Cairo, Illinois.The general was puffing a
cigar, and answered in monosyllables between puffs."You have heard nothing yet, have you, General," the commodore was
asking, "of that request we united in sending to General Halleck?"There was silence for some time, the general apparently in deep thought.The commodore broke the silence by asking:

"You went to see him personally once on this matter, did you not?""He ungraciously gave me permission to visit St.Louis in order to see
him, after I had begged for the privilege at least half a dozen times,"
Grant answered."And you laid the matter before him in all its bearings?"asked the commodore, starting in surprise."I mean," said he, "that he struck me metaphorically.I
don't believe he would have hurt me as badly, if he had really struck
me.I was never so cut in all my life.I came away feeling that I had
committed an unpardonable sin from a military standpoint.""Then he would not hear to the proposition at all?"I came away resolving never to ask
another favor of him.Yet so anxious am I to make this campaign that, as
you know, I swallowed my pride and united with you in making the request
that we be allowed to make the movement.""It is strange," replied the commodore, "that he should ignore both our
requests, not favoring us even with a reply.Yet it seems that he must
see that Fort Henry should be reduced at once.If we delay, both the
Cumberland and the Tennessee will be so strongly fortified that it will
be almost impossible to force a passage.Everything is to be gained by
moving at once."Even a civilian ought to see that," replied Grant, as he slowly blew a
cloud of smoke from his mouth, and watched it as it lazily curled
upward."The truth of it is," Grant continued slowly, as if weighing every word,
"too many of us are afraid that another general may win more honor than
we.Now, here are
Buell and myself; each with a separate command, yet both working for the
same object.I should either be subject to the command of Buell, or he
should be subject to my orders.We are now like two men trying to lift
the same burden, and instead of lifting together, one will lift and then
the other.Such a system can but prolong the war indefinitely.""General," said the commodore, earnestly, "I sincerely wish you had the
supreme command here in the West.I believe we would see different
results, and that very soon."Grant blushed like a schoolgirl, fidgeted in his seat, and then said:
"Commodore, you do me altogether too much honor.But this I will say, if
I had supreme command I should not sit still and see the Tennessee and
Cumberland rivers fortified without raising a hand to prevent it.Neither do I believe in letting month after month go by for the purpose
of drilling and organizing.The Government seems to forget that time
gives the enemy the same privilege.What is wanted is hard blows, and
these blows should be delivered as soon as possible.Sherman was right
when he asked for 200,000 men to march to the Gulf, yet he was sneered
at by the War Department, hounded by every paper in the land, called
insane, and now he is occupying a subordinate position.The war could be
ended in a year.No one now can tell how long it will last."Just then a telegram was placed in Grant's hands.He read it, and his
whole face lighted up with pleasure."You look pleased," said the commodore."The telegram must bring good
news."Without a word Grant placed the telegram in the hands of the commodore.It was an order from General Halleck to move up the Tennessee as soon as
possible and capture Fort Henry."At last," said the commodore, his face showing as much pleasure as did
Grant's."At last," responded Grant; and then, quickly, "Commodore, we may have
done an injustice to General Halleck.There may be good reasons we know
not of why this order should not have been made before.Commodore, be
ready to move with your fleet to-morrow.""General, I shall be ready; and now good-bye, for both of us have much
before us.But before I go, let me congratulate you.I believe that
success and great honor await you," and with these words the commodore
withdrew.The next day, with 15,000 men, General Grant was steaming up the
Tennessee.General Buell sat in his headquarters at Louisville.General Nelson,
accompanied by Fred, had dropped in to see his general, and at the same
time to give vent to some of his pent-up feelings.he fumed, "for us to sit here and let the
Rebels fortify Bowling Green and Dover and Columbus, and build forts to
blockade the Tennessee, and we not raise a finger to prevent it."Buell smiled at his irate general, and asked: "And what would you do,
Nelson?"I would give
them precious little time to build forts."Before General Buell could answer, an orderly entered with a telegram.He read it, and turning to Nelson, said:

"Well, General, you can cease your fuming.This telegram is from General
Halleck.He tells me he has ordered General Grant up the Tennessee to
reduce Fort Henry, and he wants me to co-operate as much as possible in
the movement."Nelson was on his feet in an instant."General," he exclaimed, "I have a favor, a great favor to ask of you."Buell smilingly answered: "I think I know what it is without your
asking."I do not see how I can spare so many men; you know we have Johnston at
Bowling Green to look after.""But General," answered Nelson, "the Tennessee and Cumberland must be
defended.In all probability the most of Johnston's army will be
transferred there.""In that case, General," answered Buell, "I will remember you.Your
division shall be the first one sent.""Thank you, General, thank you," replied Nelson."I only wish I knew I
was going.""As it is now," continued Buell, "I shall order General Crittenden to
send Cruft's brigade.That brigade is near the mouth of Green river.There is no force of the enemy, in any number, before them, and the
brigade can well be spared.I shall send no more men unless it is
absolutely necessary.I shall at once dispatch an officer to General
Crittenden with necessary orders.""General," now spoke up Fred, "like General Nelson, I have a request to
make, and by your kindness I hope to meet with better success."said Buell, "you wish to carry the orders.If Nelson has no
objection, I think I can grant that request.The general has told me
something of your history, Mr.General Thomas also speaks
in the highest terms of you.""You can go if you wish, Fred," answered Nelson."I only hope I shall
soon be with you."So it was settled, and before night Fred and his good horse Prince were
on their way down the Ohio.Fred not only carried dispatches to General
Crittenden, but he had personal letters both from General Buell and
General Nelson to General Cruft commending him to the latter officer.Disembarking at Owensboro, Fred made a swift ride to Calhoun, the
headquarters of General Crittenden.He delivered his dispatches to the
general, and at once sought the headquarters of General Cruft.The
general read Fred's letters, and then said: "You are very welcome, Mr.Shackelford; you may consider yourself as one of my staff until such
time as General Nelson may join us."Soon orders came to General Cruft to at once prepare to join Grant.It was nearly noon on February the 14th when the fleet on which General
Cruft's brigade had embarked arrived at Fort Donelson.The place had
already been invested two days, and some severe fighting had taken
place.The weather, from being warm and rainy, had suddenly turned cold
on the afternoon of the 13th, and Fred shivered as he emerged from the
comfortable cabin of the steamboat and stepped out on the cold, desolate
bank of the river.The ground was covered with ice and snow, and the
scene was dreary in the extreme.Now and then the heavy reverberation of a cannon came rolling down the
river, and echoed and re-echoed among the hills.A fleet of gunboats lay
anchored in the river, the mouths of their great guns looking out over
the dark sullen water as though watching for their prey.General Cruft's
brigade was assigned to the division of General Lew Wallace, which
occupied the center of the Federal army.Back in the rear little groups
of soldiers stood shivering around small fires, trying to warm their
benumbed limbs, or to cook their scanty rations.The condition of the soldiers was pitiable in the extreme.There were
no tents; but few had overcoats, and many on the hard, muddy march from
Fort Henry had even thrown away their blankets.In the front lines no
fires could be lighted, and there the soldiers stood, exposed to the
furious storm of sleet and snow, hungry, benumbed, hardly knowing
whether they were dead or alive.Such were the heroes who stood for
three days before Donelson.As Fred looked on all this suffering, he wondered at the fortitude with
which it was endured.There were few complaints from the soldiers; they
were even cheerful and eager to meet the foe.About three o'clock the gunboats came steaming up the river and engaged
the Confederate batteries.It was a most sublime spectacle, and held Fred spellbound.The very
heavens seemed splitting, and the earth shook and trembled from the
heavy concussions.Nearer and nearer the gunboats came to the batteries
until it seemed to Fred the great guns were vomiting fire and smoke into
each other's throats.During the fight Fred noticed a small, thickset man sitting on his horse
intently watching the fight.His countenance was perfectly impassive,
and one could not tell by watching him whether he sympathized with
friend or foe.The boilers of the Essex had been
blown up, the other boats were bruised and battered and torn by the
great shots which had struck them, and were helplessly drifting down
the stream.From the Federal side there
went up a great groan of disappointment, while from the Confederate
lines there arose the wild cheers of victory.The silent man on horseback turned and rode away.Not a sign, not a word
that he was disappointed.asked Fred of an officer standing by him."That, young man," was the answer, "is General Grant.He must be awfully
cut up, but he does not show it."Fred turned and looked after Grant as he rode slowly away."There,"
thought Fred, "is a man who is going to make his mark in this war.In
some of his actions he reminds me of General Thomas.On the frozen ground, without tents or fire,
the soldiers once more made their beds.The wind sighed and moaned
through the bare branches, as if weeping at the suffering it caused.Many, to keep from freezing, never lay down, but kept up a weary march,
so that the blood might circulate.A council of war was
held, and it was resolved that in the morning they would cut their way
through the lines of steel which Grant had thrown around them.All
preparations were made, every order given, and then they waited for the
light of morning--the last morning that hundreds would ever see.It was hardly light when Fred was awakened by the fitful sound of
musketry over on the right.In front of Wallace's division only the
report of a rifle of a picket was heard now and then.Hurriedly eating a
little breakfast, he mounted his horse and reported to General Cruft for
duty.The men were all standing at arms, but there was nothing for them
to do.But over on the right the rattle of musketry grew more intense,
the roll of heavy volleys began to be heard, and then the deep-voiced
cannon joined in the chorus.Louder and louder grew the din of the
conflict.The smoke of battle began to ascend above the treetops like
smoke from a burning coal-pit.The sound of battle came nearer, the roll
of musketry was incessant, the thunder of cannon never ceased.An officer wild with excitement came spurring his foaming horse up to
General Wallace."General McClernand wants help," he gasped."The whole Rebel army has
attacked his division.""I have orders from General Grant to hold this position at all hazards,"
replied Wallace.To Grant's headquarters the officer rides in frantic haste.The general
was away; he had started at five o'clock to see Commodore Foote, who had
been wounded in the battle of the night before, and was on board of one
of his gunboats, and the boats lay some five or six miles below.Would not some one of his staff give orders to send reinforcements to
McClernand.The officer groaned,
and rode back to McClernand with the heavy tidings.Minutes go by, the thunder of battle is terrific.The exultant cheering of the advancing foe is heard above the
roar of conflict.Another officer, with his horse bleeding from wounds, his hat gone, and
tears streaming down his face, rides to General Wallace."For God's
sake, help!"he gasps, "or everything is lost; we are flanked, we cannot
hold out longer."Then General Wallace said: "I will take the responsibility; help you
shall have."And with his face lighted up with joy the officer dashed
back to tell McClernand that help was coming.An order comes to General Cruft to at once march his brigade to the
scene of action.No sooner is the command given than the brigade is on
the way.Soon shot and shell are crashing overhead, and singing bullets
begin to cut the twigs of the bushes around.Now and then a soldier
falters and goes down.A smooth-faced, florid man rides up to General
Cruft."I am Colonel Oglesby," he says; "my brigade is being flanked on
the right.Let me lead you in position; my men are nearly out of
ammunition."And then as calmly as if on parade Colonel Dick Oglesby
leads Cruft's brigade to the relief of his men.Soon the brigade is in
the midst of the conflict.The excitement of battle is on him, and he feels no fear.Oglesby's brigade is out of ammunition.Sullenly his men fall back,
leaving over 800 of their number dead and wounded on the field, but his
left regiment refuses to go.The colonel, a large, dark man, with hair
as black as midnight, eyes like flaming stars, rages up and down the
line like a lion.Fred asks of a wounded soldier hobbling back."Colonel John A. Logan," is the answer.At last his men are out of ammunition, and Logan, bleeding from two
wounds, is obliged to lead his regiment back.Another regiment takes its
place, and after a dreadful conflict, is compelled to fall back, leaving
over 300 of their number dead and wounded.Cruft's brigade was now on the extreme right, cut off from the rest of
the army.The enemy pressed upon them; a withering volley sent them
reeling back.Fred spurred forward, and seizing
the colors of a Kentucky regiment, shouted: "Now, boys, for the honor of
old Kentucky."But on either flank
the enemy pressed, and the brigade, combating every foot, was forced
back.The enemy had gained the desired end; McClernand's division was out of
the way, the road to retreat was open.Because of the imbecility of Generals Floyd and Pillow.Broken, and with a third of its number dead and wounded, McClernand's
division is driven back on Lew Wallace.Officers, stunned with the
disaster, come wildly galloping through Wallace's lines, shouting, "All
is lost!Wallace changes front to meet the exultant, advancing foe.Firm as
adamant his lines stand.In the faces of the charging Confederates his
men pour their crushing volleys.The enemy waver, reel, then go
staggering, bleeding back.In conference with Commodore Foote on
board of a gunboat six miles down the river.He is too far away to hear
the roll of musketry, and the thunder of artillery he thinks but
cannonading between the two lines.It is past noon when the conference
is ended and he is rowed ashore.There stands a staff officer with
bloodless face and shaking limbs.In a few words the story of the
disaster is told.Without a word Grant listens, and then mounts his
horse.The iron shoes of his steed strike fire on the frozen ground as
he gallops back.He arrives just as the foe is repulsed by Wallace's
division."Why, boys," he cries, "they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."[Illustration: "Why, boys, they are trying to get away; we mustn't let
them."]The words act like magic as they are borne along the lines.Cartridge
boxes are replenished, and the soldiers, who a few moments before were
in retreat, are now eager to advance.The lines are re-formed and the
army sweeps forward.This time it is the Confederates who are pressed
back, and soon the open road is closed.The chance to escape is forever
gone; Fort Donelson is doomed.Darkness once more came, and with it another night of cold and
suffering.The early morning light showed a white flag floating from the
ramparts of the fort.Cold and hunger were
forgotten, as the soldiers in their joy embraced each other, and their
shouts of victory rose and fell like the swells of the ocean.The first
great victory of the war had been won.The storm of the elements, as well
as of battle, had passed away.On the
frozen ground lay the dead with white, pinched faces.Scores of the
wounded had perished from cold and exposure.Some who still breathed
were frozen to the ground in their own blood.The cold had been more
cruel than the bullets.Fred rode over the battlefield seeking the body of an officer in one of
the Kentucky regiments whom he had seen fall.The officer was a friend
of his father's.Where the last fierce struggle took place before the
brigade fell back, Fred found him.He was half-reclining against a tree,
and from its branches the snow had sifted down, as though trying to blot
out the crimson with a mantle of white.The officer had not died at
once, for the frozen hand held a photograph in its iron grasp--that of a
happy, sweet-faced mother holding a cooing babe.It was the photograph
of his wife and child.With a sob Fred turned away, sick--sick at heart.He was choking with
the horror that he saw.Fred's gallant act in leading the charge had been noticed by General
Cruft, and at the first opportunity he highly complimented his youthful
aid.But to Fred it now all seemed like a dream--something not real.Could it be that only yesterday he was in that hell of fire, eager only
to kill and maim!In the afternoon he went to see the prisoners mustered.As they marched
along with downcast eyes, Fred saw a well-known form among the officers
which sent every particle of blood from his face.Quickly recovering
himself, he sprang forward, exclaiming, "Uncle Charles!"Major Shackelford looked up in surprise, a frown came over his face, but
he held out his hand, and said, "Fred, you here?""Is--is father--a--prisoner--or--killed?"Fred's voice trembled, then
broke; he could not articulate another word."Your father is not here, thank God!""He is with
Johnston at Bowling Green."He now noticed for the first time a young lieutenant, his neat uniform
soiled and torn, and his eyes red with watching."Why, Cousin George, you here, too?"exclaimed Fred, holding out his
hand."I refuse," said he, "to take the hand of a traitor to his State and
kindred."The hot blood flew to Fred's face, and he was on the point of making an
angry retort, but controlling himself, he replied, "As you please," and
turned away."Uncle Charles," he said, "I know you will not be so foolish.I am
sorry--so sorry--to see you here."You surely fought like heroes," gently replied Fred."There is no
disgrace in brave men bowing to the inevitable.""And that fight was the worst of it," bitterly replied the major."Every
noble life lost was a useless sacrifice, sacrificed to the imbecility of
our generals.But, Fred, this surrender means more; it means the giving
up of Nashville.They will be wild with fear; they will flee penniless--flee I know not
where."Fred remained in deep thought for a moment, then looking up, said:
"Uncle, do you really fear for Aunt Jennie and the children?"Nashville will be wild--terror-stricken; there is no knowing what
will happen.""Uncle, if you wish, I will go to Nashville.Even if the city is taken,
there will be no danger.As
you say, the greatest danger is in flight.""Also write a statement for me," said Fred, "saying I am your nephew,
and that I am trying to reach your family in Nashville.A little later the letters were placed in Fred's hands, and bidding his
uncle a most affectionate farewell, he went to make preparations for his
journey.The next morning, provided with an order from General Grant
giving him permission to pass outside of the lines, he started.When he
was well beyond the pickets, he tore up his pass, thus destroying any
evidence that he was ever connected with the Federal army.He had not ridden many miles before he began to overtake straggling
Confederate soldiers who had escaped from Donelson.Along in the
afternoon he suddenly came upon three cavalrymen.The horse of one had
given out, and the three were debating what was best to do.Seeing Fred,
and noticing that he was well mounted, one of them said: "There comes a
boy, a civilian, on a fine hoss.Why not confiscate him for the good of
the cause?"Without warning, Fred found
himself covered by three revolvers."Come, young man," said one of the soldiers, threateningly, "off of
that hoss, and be quick about it, too.""It means the Confederate States of America have use for that hoss; so
climb down quick, and none of your lip.""But, gentlemen----"

"No buts about it," broke in the soldier fiercely."Do you mean to say
you refuse to contribute a hoss to the cause?You ought to be in the
ranks yourself instead of whining about a hoss.You must be a Lincolnite
or a coward.Get off, or I will let daylight through your carcass."There was no use parleying; so without saying a word Fred dismounted.The soldier in great glee, congratulating himself on his good fortune,
mounted.Prince laid back his ears, and a wicked gleam came into his
eyes, but as Fred said nothing, the horse made no objection."Say, boy," exclaimed the soldier, "you can have my hoss there; it's a
fair trade, you see," and with a laugh and a jeer they rode away.Fred let them go a short distance, when he suddenly gave a peculiar
short whistle.Prince gave a great bound, then wheeled as quick as
lightning.His rider was thrown with prodigious force, and lay senseless
in the road.At full speed the horse ran back and stopped by the side of
his owner, quivering with excitement.Fred vaulted into the saddle, and
with a yell of defiance dashed back in the direction he had come.Coming to a cross road, he followed it until he came to a road leading
in the direction he wished to go.Prince, old fellow, that was a trick those fellows weren't on to,"
said Fred, patting the glossy neck of his horse."You did it capitally,
my boy, capitally."Prince turned his head and whinnied as if he knew all about it.Towards evening Fred fell in with some of Forest's troopers who had
escaped from Donelson and were making their way to Nashville.The officer in command asked Fred who he was and where he was going, and
was frankly told."I know Major Shackelford well," replied the officer, "an honorable man
and a gallant soldier.I shall be happy to have you accompany us to
Nashville."Fred preferred to make more haste, but remembering his adventure,
resolved to run no more risk, and so gladly accepted the invitation.The news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had become known, and the
whole country was wild with terror.Consternation was depicted in every
countenance.For the first time the people of the South began to realize
that after all they might be defeated.When Fred entered Nashville the scene was indescribable.The whole city
was terror-stricken.Women walked the streets wringing their hands in
the agony of despair.Every avenue was blocked with vehicles of all
kinds, loaded with valuables and household goods.The inhabitants were
fleeing from what they considered destruction.Sobs and groans and
piteous wails were heard on every side.Could this be the same people he
had seen a few months before?Through the wild confusion, Fred rode
until he reached the door of his uncle's house.He found the family
preparing for hasty flight."Aunt Jennie, how are you?"Shackelford gave a shriek, and then exclaimed: "Fred Shackelford!"From Donelson and Uncle Charles," replied Fred.Shackelford turned as white as death, tottered, and would have
fallen if Fred had not caught her."Calm yourself, Aunt Jennie; both Uncle Charles and George are well."Shackelford, and tears came to the relief of
her pent-up feelings.they will die in some Northern prison, and I
shall never see them again."In all probability they will be exchanged in a
few weeks or released on parole.It will do you good to read it," and he handed her the letter her
husband had written.When she had read it, she became calmer, and said, "He wishes me to stay
here.""By all means, Aunt Jennie," replied Fred."Stop these preparations for
flight; be discreet, and you will be as safe in Nashville with the
Northern soldiers here as if they were a thousand miles away."Just then Kate came in, her vivacity all gone, and her eyes red with
weeping.she asked in surprise and with some hauteur.When I heard of it I vowed I would never
speak to you again.""But you see you have," replied Fred, smiling.she asked, ignoring Fred's
remark."Drive them back with broomsticks," replied Fred, mischievously.asked Kate, opening her eyes in astonishment."My pretty cousin, didn't you tell me when I was here that if the
Yankees ever dare come near Nashville the women would turn out and beat
them back with broomsticks?""I will never speak to you again; so
there!"But when Kate learned that Fred had just come from her father and
brother she was eager enough to talk, and Fred had to tell the story of
Donelson over and over again.As they were talking, the clatter of
horse's hoofs attracted the attention of the family, and Fred, glancing
out of the window, saw his father dismounting before the door.He arose trembling in every limb, and gasped:

"Aunt Jennie, my father!I cannot meet him; he has forbidden it," and he
passed into another room.Colonel Shackelford entered, and was warmly greeted by his
sister-in-law.He had but a moment to stay, as his regiment was on the
retreat, and the Federals were reported in close pursuit."I see," said he, "you have prepared for flight.I trust that you will
accompany my command until you reach a place of safety."Shackelford, "but have changed our minds.I have just received a letter from Charles, who is a prisoner, and he
has advised me to stay.""Charles a prisoner, and a letter from him!Colonel Shackelford asked in surprise.Shackelford hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Fred brought
it."The colonel started violently, and then asked in a broken voice, "Fred
here?"Shackelford had to tell all she knew."I will see him," said the colonel.Fred was told his father wished to see him; his heart gave a great
bound, as he rushed into the room with the cry of "Father!"on his lips,
and was about to spring into his arms when the stern command of "Stop!"rooted him, as it were, to the floor."Before you call me father," said the colonel, sternly, "I want to know
whether you have repented of your folly, or whether you are here as a
spy.If I thought the latter, as sure as there is a God in heaven I
would be tempted to give you up to the authorities to be hanged."If a dagger had pierced Fred's heart it would not have caused him keener
pain than the words of his father.He stood for a moment as if deprived
of the power of speech.Then the angry surges of an outraged nature came
to his relief, and his whole soul arose in protest to the indignity put
upon him."I have neither repented of my folly, as you call it," he replied
fiercely, "nor am I here as a spy.I came here on an errand of mercy at
the earnest request of Uncle Charles.Denounce me as a spy if you
choose; the act can be no more cruel than your words," and Fred turned
and left the room.Shackelford, "are you not too severe with the
boy?At extreme peril to himself he brought a letter from Charles, and
his coming has been a great comfort to me."Colonel Shackelford passed his hands before his eyes, and then groped
for a chair as if he had been smitten with blindness."Jennie," he replied in a low voice, trembling with emotion, "you do not
know the agony the course of that boy has caused me.But I am half-crazed over
the terrible disaster at Donelson.In a few days, at the most, the
Northern horde will be here in Nashville.But," and his face lighted up
with enthusiasm, "all is not lost, Jennie; we will soon be back.I know
something of the plans of General Johnston.The army will concentrate
somewhere along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad,
probably at Corinth, and then before Grant and Buell can combine we will
crush them in detail.They think Donelson has broken our spirit; they
will find out differently."Fred being only in the next room, heard these words, and they made a
deep impression on his mind.Colonel Shackelford soon took his leave, bidding his sister-in-law keep
up courage, as the Northern army would soon be hurled back.The panic in Nashville kept up until February 25th, when, to Fred's joy,
General Nelson's division came steaming up the river, and the city was
occupied by the Federal army.The stars and stripes once more floated
over the State capitol, and never again were they hauled down.The alarm in Nashville in a great measure subsided, and business once
more resumed its way.As for Fred, his delight at meeting General Nelson so soon was
unbounded.He had come to look upon him almost as a father, and the
fiery old fellow returned his affection.Fred told the general of his aunt, and received the promise that he
would see that she was not molested or annoyed in any manner, and this
promise was religiously kept.As long as he remained in Nashville Fred made his home at the house of
his aunt, and, notwithstanding his Yankee proclivities, became as great
a favorite with his cousin Kate as ever.When the time came for Buell to
advance, the family parted with Fred almost as affectionately as though
he had been one of them; and their sincere prayers followed him that he
might be preserved from the dangers of war.A few days after the surrender of Fort Donelson General Grant was
relieved of his command, and was even threatened with arrest.General
Halleck, in his headquarters at St.Louis, had worked himself into a fit
of what he considered most righteous anger.General Buell had ordered
one of Grant's divisions to Nashville, and Grant had taken a trip to
that city to find out the reason for the order.During his absence some
irregularities had occurred at Donelson, and Grant was most viciously
attacked by some anonymous scribbler, and then by the press.He was
accused of being absent from his command without leave, of drunkenness,
of maintaining no discipline, and of refusing to forward reports.The telegraph operator at
Fort Henry was a Confederate in disguise.He coolly pocketed Halleck's
dispatches to Grant.He held his position for some days, and then fled
south with his pocket full of dispatches.General Grant was relieved of
his command, and General C. F. Smith, a gray-haired veteran, who smoked
a cigar as he led his men in the charge at Donelson, was appointed in
his place.The feeling against Grant was so bitter at headquarters, that
General McClellan telegraphed to General Halleck to arrest him if he
thought best.The hero of Donelson deeply felt his disgrace, yet wrote to General
Smith:

"Allow me to congratulate you on your richly deserved promotion, and to
assure you that no one can feel more pleasure than myself."Even General Halleck was at length convinced of the injustice he had
done Grant, and restored him to his command on March 13th.In the mean time Grant's army, under Smith, had been gathering at
Pittsburg Landing, and Buell's army had been concentrated at Nashville.The two armies were to concentrate at Pittsburg Landing, and then move
on Corinth, where the Confederates were gathering in force.Not a thought seemed to have entered the minds of the Union generals
that the army at Pittsburg Landing might be attacked before Buell could
come up.Halleck, Grant, Buell, Smith, Sherman--all seemed to rest in
fancied security.If the possibility of an attack was ever spoken of, it
was passed by as idle talk.General Buell commenced his forward movement from Nashville on March
15th.General A. D. McCook's division had the advance, General Nelson's
division came next.The bridge over Duck river near Columbia was found
burned.Buell set to work leisurely to rebuild it.Just before the army left Nashville, General
Nelson placed in his hands a parchment."This," said Nelson, "is what General Buell and myself were talking
about in Louisville as a small reward for your service.Take it, my boy,
for you richly deserve it."It was a commission as captain, and detailed him as an independent
scout, subject to the orders of General William Nelson."Why, General," stammered Fred, "I didn't want this.You know, you told
me it was better for me not to enlist.""I know," responded Nelson, "but as you are with the army so much, it is
better for you to wear a uniform and have a rank that will command
respect."So Fred became "captain" in earnest.During his conversations with Nelson, Fred told him what he had heard
his father say to his aunt about Grant and Buell being crushed in
detail, and the general became thoroughly imbued with the idea that the
army at Pittsburg Landing was in grave danger.He chafed like a caged tiger at the delay in crossing Duck
river.At length he sought Buell, who laughed at his fears, and said
that he would not move until the bridge was completed."Why, Nelson, what's the matter with you any way?""Here we have been puttering
with this bridge for nearly a week, and all this time the force at
Pittsburg Landing is in danger of being attacked and annihilated."Buell leaned back in his chair, and looking quizzically at Nelson, said:

"You seem to know more about it, General, than either Halleck or Grant.Halleck telegraphed me that there is no danger of the force at Pittsburg
Landing being attacked.""I don't care what Halleck telegraphs," roared Nelson, now thoroughly
aroused."I tell you there is; I feel it, I know it."asked Buell, showing considerable interest.A small force encamped only
twenty miles from Corinth, where Johnston is concentrating his army.Johnston is a fool if he doesn't attack, and no one yet has ever accused
him of being one.General, give my division the advance; let me ford
Duck river."Buell was really fond of Nelson, despite his rough, overbearing ways,
and after some hesitation gave him the required permission.The life of
General Grant might not read as it does now, if that permission had been
withheld.On the morning of March 29th Nelson's division forded Duck river, and
started on its forced march for Savannah, on the Tennessee river.On
this march Nelson showed no mercy to stragglers, and many were the
curses heaped upon his head.One day Fred found a boy, no older than himself, lashed behind a cannon.The lad belonged to an Indiana regiment that in some manner had incurred
the displeasure of the general, and he was particularly severe on
members of this regiment if found straggling.The boy in question had
been found away from his command, and had been tied by his wrists to a
cannon.Behind this gun he had to march through the mud, every jolt
sending sharp pain through his wrists and arms, and if he should fall
life itself would be imperiled.It was a heartless, and in this case,
cruel punishment.Fred noticed the boy, and rode up to him and asked him
his name, and he gave it as Hugh Raymond.He was a fine-looking fellow,
and seemed to feel deeply his humiliation.He was covered with mud, and
the tears that he could not hold back had left their dirty trail down
his cheeks.Fred went to Nelson, begged for the boy's release, and got
it.It was but few requests that Nelson would not grant Fred.When Nelson started on his march to Savannah he expected to reach that
place on April 7th.But once on the march his eagerness increased, and
he resolved to reach Savannah, if possible, by the 4th, or at least the
5th of the month.On the morning of the third day's march Fred met with an adventure that
haunted him for years afterward.He never thought of it without a
shudder, and over and over again he lived it in his dreams, awaking with
a cry of agony that sounded unearthly to those who heard it.General Nelson and staff had put up at the commodious house of a planter
named Lane.They were most hospitably entertained, although Mr.Lane
made no secret of the fact that he was an ardent sympathizer with the
South.In the morning, as Fred was about to mount his horse to resume the
march, he discovered that he had left his field-glass in the room he had
occupied during the night.On returning for it, he heard voices in the
next room, one of which sounded so familiar that he stopped a moment to
listen, and to his amazement recognized the voice of his cousin Calhoun.One thing was certain; he
had been exchanged and was once more in the army.Lane
were engaged in earnest conversation, and Fred soon learned that his
cousin had been concealed in the house during the night."I have," replied Calhoun, "thanks to your kindness.I heard Nelson say
he would rush his division through, and that he wanted to be in Savannah
by the 5th.Johnston must,
shall strike Grant before that time.I must be in Corinth within the
next twenty-four hours, if I kill a dozen horses in getting there.Is
my horse where I left him, at the stable in the woods?"Lane; "and well cared for and groomed.But
breakfast is ready; you must eat a hearty meal before you start."Fred realized that the fate of an army was at stake.Something must be
done, and that something must be done quickly.Slipping out of the
house, he took a look around.Back of the house about a half a mile
distant was a thick piece of wood.A lane led through the fields to this
wood.No doubt it was there that Calhoun's horse was concealed.Fred quickly made up his mind what to do.Mounting his horse, he rode
rapidly away until out of sight of the house; then, making Prince jump
the fence, he rode through the field until he reached the wood, and then
back nearly to the lane he had noticed.Tying his horse, he crept close
to the path, and concealed himself.He soon saw
Calhoun coming up the path with quick, springing steps.To Fred's great
joy he was alone.He let him pass, and then stealthily as an Indian
followed him.Calhoun soon reached the rude stable, and went in."Now, my hearty," said he, as he patted his horse, "we have a long hard
ride before us.But we carry news, my boy--news that may mean
independence to the Sunny South."Strong arms were suddenly thrown around him, and despite his desperate
resistance and struggles, he soon found himself lying on his face, his
hands held behind his back and securely tied.His ankles were then
firmly bound together.When all this was done he was raised to his feet
and a voice said:

"Sorry, Cal, but I had to do it," and to Calhoun's amazement his cousin
stood before him, panting from his exertion.For a moment Calhoun was speechless with astonishment; then his rage
knew no limit, and bound as he was, he tried to get at his cousin."I reckon," said Fred, quietly, "that I must make you more secure," and
taking a stout strap he lashed him securely to a post."Is this the way you keep your oath?"hissed Calhoun, and he spat at
Fred in his contempt."Loose me, you sneaking villain, loose me at once,
or I will raise an alarm, and Mr.Lane and his men will be here, and
they will make short work of you."Just then the notes of a bugle, sweet and clear, came floating through
the air."You had better raise no alarm;
McCook's division is passing, and I have but to say a word and you
swing."Calhoun ground his teeth in impotent rage.At last he asked:

"Fred, what do you want?Have you not sworn to
guard my life as sacredly as your own?"Fred stood looking at his cousin a moment, as if in deep thought; then
an expression of keenest pain came over his face, and he said in a
strained, unnatural voice:

"Calhoun, believe me, I would I were dead instead of standing before you
as I do now.""I should think that you would, if you have a vestige of honor left,"
answered Calhoun, with a sneer."An oath, which an honorable man would
hold more sacred than life itself seems to be lightly regarded by you.""I shall come to that directly," replied Fred, in the same unnatural
tone.To him his voice sounded afar off, as if some one else were
talking."Now, Calhoun, listen; you have a secret, a secret on which the fate of
an army depends."Calhoun, you have been
playing the spy again.do you hear the tramp of McCook's columns.If I did my duty I would cry, 'Here is a spy,' and what then?"Calhoun's face grew ashen; then his natural bravery came to his rescue."I defy you," he exclaimed, his eyes flaming with wrath."Hang me if you
will, and then in the sight of God behold yourself a murderer worse than
Cain.""Calhoun, once more I say, listen.The information that you have you
shall not take to Johnston.What I do now
would hang me instead of you, if Buell knew.But I trust you with more
than life; I trust you with my honor.Give me your sacred word that you
will keep away from Corinth until after Buell and Grant have joined
forces; promise as sacredly that you will not directly or indirectly
divulge in any manner to any person the knowledge you have gained, and I
will release you."Calhoun looked Fred in the face, hesitated, and then slowly answered:
"You seem to think I have more honor and will keep an oath better than
yourself."Calhoun," he cried, "you do not, you cannot mean
it.Promise, for the love of heaven,
promise!""I will not promise, I will die first," replied Calhoun, doggedly.A
faint hope was arising in his mind that Fred was only trying to frighten
him; that he had only to remain firm, and that, at the worst, Fred would
only try to keep him a prisoner.Calhoun's words were to Fred as a sentence of death.He sank on his
knees, and lifted his hands imploringly."Calhoun," he moaned, "see me, see me here at your feet.It is I, not
you, who is to be pitied.For the love we bear each other"--at the word
"love" Calhoun's lips curled in contempt--"for the sake of those near
and dear to us, for the honor of our names, promise, oh, promise me!"See, I spit on you, I despise you, defy
you.""Then you must die," replied Fred, slowly rising to his feet."Fred, you will not give me up to be
hanged?""No, Calhoun, your dishonor would be my dishonor.I cannot keep my oath,
and have you hanged as a spy.""I shall shoot you with my own hand.""You do not, cannot mean
that?""It is the only way I can keep my oath and still prevent you from
carrying the news that would mean destruction to Grant's army."How can you keep your oath by
murdering me?""Calhoun, I swore to consider your honor as sacred as my own, to value
your life as highly as my own, to share with you whatever fate might
come.After I put a bullet through your heart, I
shall put one through my own brain._We both must die._"

Calhoun's face seemed frozen with horror.He gasped and tried to speak,
but no words came."Calhoun," continued Fred, in a tone that sounded as a voice from one
dead, "would that you had promised, for it can do no good not to
promise.Now, say your prayers, for in a
moment we both will be standing before our Maker."Fred bowed his head in silent prayer; but Calhoun, with his
horror-stricken face, never took his eyes from off his cousin."Good-bye, Calhoun," said Fred, as he raised his revolver."For God's sake, don't shoot!The words seemed to explode
from Calhoun's lips.[Illustration: "For God's Sake, don't shoot!For a moment Fred stood as motionless as a statue, with the revolver
raised; then the weapon dropped from his nerveless hand, and with a low
moan he plunged forward on his face.So long did he lie in a swoon that Calhoun thought he was dead, and
called to him in the most endearing tones.At last there was a slight
quivering of the limbs, then he began to moan; finally he sat up and
looked around as one dazed.Seeing Calhoun, he started, passed his hand
across his brow as if to collect his thoughts, and said, as if in
surprise: "Why, Calhoun----" Then it all came back to him in its terror
and awfulness, and he fell back sick and faint.Rallying, he struggled
to his feet, tottered to Calhoun, and cut the bonds that bound him."It will not do for us to be found here
together."The two boys clasped hands for a moment, then each turned and went his
separate way.When Fred joined Nelson an hour later the general looked at him sharply,
and asked: "What's the matter, Fred?You look ten years
older than you did yesterday.""I am not really sick, but I am not feeling well, General," replied
Fred; "and I believe, with your permission, I will take an ambulance for
the rest of the day.""Do, Fred, do," kindly replied Nelson, and for the rest of the day Fred
rode in an ambulance, where he could be alone with his thoughts.That evening he asked General Nelson when he expected the division would
reach Savannah."By the 5th, if possible, on the 6th anyway," answered the general."Make it the 5th, General; don't let anything stop you; hurry!Nelson looked after him and muttered: "I wonder what's the matter with
the boy; he hasn't appeared himself to-day; but it may be he will be all
right in the morning.I shall take his advice and hurry, anyway."The next day Nelson urged on his men with a fury that caused the air to
be blue with oaths.And it was well that he did, or Shiloh would have
never been reached in time to aid the gallant soldiers of Grant.Buell saw no need of hurrying.He thought it would be a fine thing to
concentrate his whole army at Waynesborough and march into Savannah with
flying colors, showing Grant what a grand army he had.He telegraphed
General Halleck for permission to do so, and the request was readily
granted.In some manner it became known to the Confederate spies that
Buell's army was to halt at Waynesborough, and the glad tidings were
quickly borne to General Johnston, and when that general marched forth
to battle he had no expectation that he would have to meet any of
Buell's men.General Buell hurried forward to stop Nelson at Waynesborough, according
to his plan; but to his chagrin he found that Nelson, in his headlong
haste, was already beyond Waynesborough, and so the plan of stopping him
had to be given up.When General Nelson's advance was a little beyond Waynesborough, a party
engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Savannah to
Nashville was met.A telegram was handed their general, which read:


     TO THE OFFICER COMMANDING BUELL'S ADVANCE:

     There is no need of haste; come on by easy stages.U. S. GRANT,
     Major-General Commanding.Nelson read the telegram, and turning to Fred said:

"This is small comfort for all my hurry.I wonder if I have made a fool
of myself, after all.Buell will have the joke on me, sure.""Better be that way than have you needed and not there," answered Fred."If we are needed and are not there, Grant can only blame himself," was
Nelson's reply.At noon on April 5th Ammen's brigade, the advance of Nelson's division,
marched into Savannah.Colonel Ammen reported his arrival, and said:

"My men are not tired; we can march on to Pittsburg Landing if
necessary."The answer was: "Rest, and make your men comfortable.There will be no
battle at Pittsburg Landing.Boats will be sent for you in a day or
two."There was to be a rude awakening on the morrow."The sun of Austerlitz" was neither brighter nor more glorious than the
sun which arose over the field of Shiloh Sunday morning, April 6, 1862.Around the little log chapel, wont to echo to the voice of prayer and
song of praise, along the hillsides and in the woods, lay encamped the
Federal army.The soldiers had lain down the night before without a
thought of what this bright, sunny Sabbath would bring forth.A sense of
security pervaded the whole army.From commander down to private, there
was scarcely a thought of an attack."I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack," wrote Grant to Halleck
on April 5th.On the evening of the same day Sherman wrote to Grant: "I do not
apprehend anything like an attack upon our position."Yet when these words were written the Confederate army was in battle
array not much over three miles distant.But there was one general in the Federal army who was uneasy, he hardly
knew why.He was little known at the time, he never held a
distinguished command afterward; yet it was by his vigilance that the
Federal army was saved from surprise, perhaps from capture.A vague idea that something was wrong haunted him.The
ominous silence in front oppressed him, as something to be feared.An unusual number of squirrels and
rabbits were noticed dodging through the line, and they were all headed
in one direction--toward Pittsburg Landing.To guard more surely against surprise Prentiss posted his pickets a mile
and a half in front of his lines, an unusual distance.At three o'clock
Sunday morning he sent three companies of the Twenty-fifth Missouri out
on a reconnoitering expedition.These three companies followed a road
that obliqued to the right, and a little after daylight met the enemy's
advance in front of Sherman's division.Thus the battle of Shiloh
opened.When the first shots were fired, Preston Johnston, son of the
Confederate commander, looked at his watch, and it was just fourteen
minutes past five o'clock.This little advance band must have made a brave fight, for Major
Hardcastle, in command of the Confederate outposts, reports that he
fought a thousand men an hour.It was after six o'clock when the general
advance of the whole Confederate army commenced, and the pickets along
the line of Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions were driven in.Preston
Johnston states that it was seven o'clock when the first cannon shot was
fired.It was eight o'clock before the engagement became general along
the whole line, and at that time portions of Prentiss' division had been
fighting for nearly three hours.General Grant was at breakfast in Savannah, nine miles away, when he was
startled by the booming of cannon in the direction of Shiloh.Hastily
writing an order to General Nelson to procure a guide and march his
division up the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, Grant left
his breakfast half-eaten, and boarding his dispatch boat was soon
steaming up the river.His fear was that the isolated division of
General Lewis Wallace, which lay at Crump's Landing, had been attacked.Finding this not to be the case when he reached Crump's, he bade Wallace
hold his division in readiness and to await orders, and steamed on.Turning to Rawlins, his
chief-of-staff, Grant said:

"Rawlins, I am afraid this is a general attack.Prentiss' and Sherman's divisions are in front, and both are composed of
raw troops; but if we can hold them until Wallace and Nelson come we are
all right.""It is a pity you did not order Wallace up when you were there,"
answered Rawlins."Yes," answered Grant, "but I couldn't make up my mind it was a general
attack."It sounds very much like it," replied Rawlins, grimly.When Grant reached the landing the battle was raging furiously, and all
doubts as to its being a general attack were removed from his mind.Already the vanguard of what was afterward an army of panic-stricken men
had commenced gathering under the river bank.A staff officer was sent back immediately to order General Wallace to
come at once.Grant then set to work quickly to do what he could to stem
the tide, which was already turning against him.Two or three regiments
which had just landed he ordered to points where they were the most
needed.He then rode the entire length of the line, encouraging his
generals, telling them to stand firm until Wallace and Nelson came, and
all would be well.Some of his regiments
had broken at the first fire, and fled panic-stricken to the Landing.Sherman was straining every nerve to hold his men firm.Oblivious of
danger, he rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved, encouraging,
pleading, threatening, as the case might be.Grant cautioned him to be
careful, and not expose himself unnecessarily, but Sherman answered: "If
I can stem the tide by sacrificing my life, I will willingly do it."Then turning to Grant, he said, with feeling: "General, I did not
expect this; forgive me.""I am your senior general," answered Sherman."You depended on me for
reports; I quieted your fears.I reported there was no danger of an
attack.I couldn't believe it this morning until my orderly was shot by
my side, and I saw the long lines of the enemy sweeping forward."There is nothing to forgive," he said, gently."The mistake is mine as well as yours.If I had, I could have had Buell here.As it is, Wallace and Nelson will
soon be here, and we will whip them; never fear."By ten o'clock Prentiss had been pushed back clear through and beyond
his camp, and had taken position along a sunken road.General W. H. L.
Wallace's division came up and joined him on the right.This part of the
field was afterward known as the "Hornet's Nest."Here Grant visited them, and seeing the strength of the position, told
them to hold it to the last man."We will," responded both Wallace and Prentiss.For hours the Confederate lines beat
against them like the waves of the ocean, only to be flung back torn and
bleeding.Both flanks of the Federal army
were bent back like a bow.Every moment the number of panic-stricken
soldiers under the bank grew larger.Noon came, but no Lew Wallace, no Nelson.Turning to an aid, Grant said:
"Go for Wallace; bid him hurry, hurry."Everywhere, except in the center, the Confederates were pressing the
Union lines back.But the desperate resistance offered surprised
Johnston; he had expected an easier victory.Many of his best regiments
had been cut to pieces.Thousands of his men had also fled to the rear.The afternoon was passing; the fighting must be pressed.A desperate effort was made to turn the Federal left flank, and thus
gain the Landing.Like iron Hurlbut's men stood, and time after time
hurled back the charging columns.At last the Confederates refused to
charge again.Then General Johnston placed himself at their head and
said: "I will lead you, my children."With wild cheers his men pressed forward;
nothing could withstand the fury of the charge.The Federal left was
crushed, hurled back to the Landing in a torn, disorganized mass.For a time the Confederate
army stood as if appalled at its great loss.The thunder of battle died
away, only to break out here and there in fitful bursts.But the
respite was brief, and then came the final desperate onslaught.With features as impassive as stone, Grant saw his army crumbling to
pieces.Officer after officer had been sent to see what had become of
General Lew Wallace; he should have been on the field hours before.With
anxious eyes Grant looked across the river to see if he could catch the
first fluttering banner of Nelson's division.An officer rides up, one of the messengers he had sent for Wallace.The officer
reports: "Wallace took the wrong road.I found him five miles further
from the Landing than when he started.Then he countermarched, instead
of hurrying forward left in front.Then he
is marching so slow, so slow.For an instant a spasm of pain passed over Grant's face."He
countermarched; coming slow," he said, as if to himself, "Great God,
what does he mean?"Turning to Colonel Webster, he said: "Plant the siege guns around the
Landing.See that you have every available piece of artillery in
position."And it was only this frowning line of artillery that stood between
Grant's army and utter rout."Have you any way of retreat mapped out?"Buell had come up from Savannah on a boat, and was now on the field,
viewing with consternation and alarm the tremendous evidences of
demoralization and defeat.Turning to him as quick as a flash, Grant replied: "Retreat!I
have not yet despaired of victory."Both the right and left wings of Grant's army were now crushed back from
the center.Around the flanks of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss'
divisions the exultant Confederates poured.Well had Wallace and
Prentiss obeyed the orders of Grant to hold their position.From ten
o'clock in the forenoon until nearly five o'clock in the afternoon their
lines had hurled back every attack of the enemy.The Hornet's Nest stung
every time it was touched.But now the divisions were hemmed in on every
side.The brave Wallace formed his men to cut their way out, and as he
was cheering them on he fell mortally wounded.No better soldier than
Wallace fell on that bloody field.As for the two divisions, they were
doomed.General Grant sits on his horse, watching the preparations for the last
stand.An officer, despair written in every lineament of his face, rides
up to him."General," he says, "Sherman reports that he has taken his last
position.He has but the remnant of one brigade with him and what
stragglers he has gathered."Go back," quietly said Grant, "and tell Sherman to hold if possible;
night is most here."McClernand's division had been standing bravely all day, and had
furnished fewer stragglers than any other division in the army, but now
an orderly with a pale face and his left arm resting in a bloody sling,
came spurring his reeking horse up to Grant, and exclaimed:

"General McClernand bade me report, that after his division had most
gallantly repulsed the last charge of the enemy, for some unaccountable
reason, the left regiments broke, and are fleeing panic-stricken to the
Landing.""Go tell McClernand," said Grant, "that he has done well, but he must
hold out just a little longer.General Hurlbut, his face black with the smoke of battle, rode up."General," he said, in a broken voice, "my division is gone, the whole
left is gone; the way to the Landing is open to the enemy.""General," replied Grant, without a quiver, "rally what broken regiments
and stragglers you can behind the guns, close up as much as possible on
McClernand, and hold your position to the last man."Now there came roaring past a confused mass of white-faced officers and
soldiers commingled, a human torrent stricken with deadly fear."Prentiss and Wallace have
surrendered.""Oh, for Lew Wallace, for Nelson, or
for night," he groaned.From across the river there came to his ears the sound of cheering.Grant looked, and there among the trees he saw the banners of Nelson's
regiments waving.Hope came into his eyes; his face lighted up.he cried to his aids, "go to Sherman, to McClernand, to
Hurlbut.But if Grant had known it the danger had already passed; for Beauregard
had given orders for his army to cease fighting.Night was coming on,
the capture of W. H. L. Wallace's and Prentiss' divisions had
disarranged his lines, and thinking that he was sure of his prey in the
morning, he had given orders to withdraw.One brigade of the Confederate army did not receive this order, and when
Nelson's advance crossed the river this brigade was charging the line of
cannon on the left.These cannon were entirely unprotected by infantry,
and Grant himself placed Nelson's men in line as they arrived.The Confederate brigade was advancing with triumphant shouts, when they
were met with a withering volley and sent reeling back.Then, to his
surprise, the commander found that of all of the Confederate army his
brigade was the only one continuing the fight, and he hastily fell back.Alone and practically unaided the brave soldiers of the Army of the
Tennessee had fought the battle of Sunday and saved themselves from
capture.The battle of Monday was mainly the fight of the Army of the Ohio.Without its aid Grant could never have been able to turn defeat into
victory, and send the Confederate hosts in headlong flight back to
Corinth.There would have been no advance Monday morning if Buell had
not been on the field.The whole energy of Grant would have been devoted
to the saving of what remained of his army.The terrible conflict of the day had left its impress on the Army of the
Tennessee.There was but a remnant in line capable of battle when night
came.The generals of divisions were so disheartened that the coming of Buell
failed to restore their spirits.Even the lion-hearted Sherman wavered
and was downcast.Grant found him sitting in the darkness beside a tree,
his head buried in his hands, and his heart full of fears.Three horses had been shot under him, and he
had received two wounds.When Grant told him there was to be an advance
in the morning, he sadly shook his head and said: "No use, General, no
use; the fight is all out of the men.I do not possibly see how we can
assume the offensive."If we assume the offensive in the morning a glorious victory awaits us.Lew Wallace is here; Buell will have at least 20,000 fresh troops on the
field.The Confederates, like ourselves, are exhausted and demoralized.If we become the aggressors, success is sure."Sherman became convinced; his fears were gone, his hopes revived.Why was it that the fiery and impetuous Nelson was so late in getting on
the field?He was only nine miles away early in the morning, and had
received orders from Grant to move his division opposite Pittsburg
Landing.If there had been any roads there would have been no excuse for
his delay.But a heavily timbered, swampy bottom lay between him and his
destination.The river had been very high, overflowing the whole bottom,
and when the water had receded it left a waste of mud, from which all
vestige of a road had disappeared.To plunge into that waste of mud and
wilderness without a guide would have been madness.A guide, though
Grant said one could easily be found, could not be secured.So Nelson
sent a staff officer to see if he could find a practicable route.This
officer did not return until noon.All of this time the division lay
listening to the booming of cannon and eager to be led to the fray.As
for Nelson, he fretted and fumed, stormed and swore at the delay."The expected has come," he growled, "and here I am doing no more good
than if I were a hundred miles away.Might have been on the field, too,
if Grant had not kept saying, 'No use hurrying!'I knew they were a set
of fools to think that Johnston would sit down at Corinth and suck his
thumbs."At length a guide was found who said he could pilot the division
through the bottom, but that the route was passable only for horsemen
and infantry; the artillery would have to be left behind.The division
started at one o'clock, the men keeping step to the music of the thunder
of cannon."This beats Donelson," remarked Fred, as the roar of artillery never
ceased."My boy," replied Nelson, "the greatest battle ever fought on this
continent is now being waged.God grant that we may get there in time.It was rumored at Savannah that the Confederates were sweeping
everything before them.""Your division will surely give a good account of itself," said Fred,
looking back, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm."See how eager the men
are, and how well they keep closed up, notwithstanding the mud.Half of
them are mourning because they think the battle will be over before they
get there.""The question is, shall we be in
time."Soon the roll of musketry began to be heard; then the cheers of the
combatants.A quiver of excitement ran along the lines, and every
soldier grasped his musket with a firmer hold.As they approached the
river cannon balls began to crash through the treetops above them; then
was heard the peculiar whir of the minie ball when it is nearly
spent--so close was the fighting to the river.To Fred's surprise, he saw numerous skulkers dodging through the timber
on the same side of the river as himself.In some manner they had
managed to get across the river; not only this, but the boats which came
to ferry Nelson's troops over were more or less crowded with these
skulkers, who would have died rather than be driven off.In the river
were seen men on logs making their way across, and some of these men
wore shoulder straps.So incensed were Nelson's soldiers at the sight of such cowardice that
they begged for permission to shoot them.As they landed, Fred stood aghast at the sight before him.Cowering
beneath the high bank were thousands upon thousands of trembling
wretches.It was a dense mass of shivering, weeping, wailing, swearing,
praying humanity, each one lost to shame, lost to honor, lost to
everything but that dreadful fear which chained him soul and body.As Nelson's advance brigade forced its way through the panic-stricken
throng, they were greeted with, "You are all going to your death!"Don't touch my men; you
contaminate them; don't speak to them, you cowards, miscreants, you
should be swept from the face of the earth."And in the fury of his wrath, Nelson begged for the privilege of turning
cannon on them.With firm, unwavering steps, and well closed up, the division pressed
their way up the bank, and there were soldiers in the ranks who looked
with contempt on the shivering wretches below the hill, who themselves,
the next day, fled in terror from the awful destruction going on around
them.So little do we know ourselves and what we will do when the
supreme moment comes.Afterward the great majority of the soldiers who cowered under the bank
at Shiloh covered themselves with glory, and hundreds of them laid down
their lives for their country.From the Landing
came the groans and shrieks of the wounded, tortured under the knives of
the surgeons.The night was as dark and cloudy as the day had been
bright and clear.About eleven o'clock a torrent of rain fell, drenching
the living, and cooling the fevered brows of the wounded.Fred sat
against a tree, holding the bridle of his horse in his hand.If by
chance he fell asleep, he would be awakened by the great cannon of the
gunboats, which threw shells far inland every fifteen minutes.At the first dawn of day Nelson's division advanced, and the battle
began.Fred acted as aid to Nelson, and as the general watched him as he
rode amid the storm of bullets unmoved he would say to those around him:
"Just see that boy; there is the making of a hero."About eleven o'clock one of Nelson's brigades made a most gallant
charge.Wheeling to the right, the brigade swept the Confederate line
for more than half a mile.Before them the enemy fled, a panic-stricken
mob.A battery was run over as though the guns were blocks of wood,
instead of iron-throated monsters vomiting forth fire and death.In the
thickest of the fight, Fred noticed Robert Marsden, the betrothed of
Mabel Vaughn, cheering on his men.thought Fred, "he is worthy of Mabel.May his life be spared to
make her happy."On, on swept the brigade; a second battery was reached, and over one of
the guns he saw Marsden fighting like a tiger.Then the smoke of battle
hid him from view.On the left Fred saw a mere boy spring from out an Indiana regiment,
shoot down a Confederate color-bearer, snatch the colors from his dying
grasp, wave them defiantly in the face of the enemy, and then coolly
walk back to his place in the ranks.General Nelson saw the act, and turning to Fred, said: "I want you to
hunt that boy up, and bring him to me after the battle."But the brigade paid dearly for its daring charge.A strong line, lying
down, let the frightened fugitives pass over them; then they arose and
poured a deadly volley into the very faces of the charging column.Cannon in front and on the flank tore great gaps through the line.The
brigade halted, wavered, and then fled wildly back, leaving a third of
its number dead and wounded.By three o'clock the battle was over; the Confederates were in full
retreat, and the bloody field of Shiloh won.As the firing died away, Fred sat on his horse and shudderingly surveyed
the field.The muddy ground was trampled as by the feet of giants.The
forest was shattered as by ten thousand thunderbolts, while whole
thickets had been leveled, as though a huge jagged scythe had swept over
them.By tree and log, in every thicket, on every hillside, dotting every
field, lay the dead and wounded.Many of the dead were crushed out of
all semblance of humanity, trampled beneath the hoof of the warhorse or
ground beneath the ponderous wheels of the artillery.Over 20,000 men
lay dead and wounded, Confederate and Federal commingled.The fondest hopes of the Confederates had
been blasted; instead of marching triumphantly forward to Nashville, as
they hoped, they retreated sullenly back to Corinth.But the battle brought the war to the hearts of the people as it had
never been brought before.From the stricken homes of the North and the
South there arose a great wail of agony--a weeping for those who would
not return.On Monday morning, just as the first scattering shots of Nelson's
skirmishers were heard, Calhoun Pennington presented himself before the
Hon.G. M. Johnson, Provisional Governor of Kentucky, on whose staff he
was.When the Confederates retreated from Bowling Green Governor Johnson
accompanied the Kentucky brigade south, and although not a soldier he
had bravely fought throughout the entire battle of the day before.The Governor and General Beauregard were engaged in earnest conversation
when Calhoun came up, and both uttered an exclamation of surprise at his
forlorn appearance.He was pale and haggard, his eyes were sunken and
his garments were dripping with water, for he had just swum the
Tennessee river.cried Johnson, and he caught
Calhoun's hand and wrung it until he winced with pain."It is what is left of me," answered Calhoun, with a faint smile."You don't know," continued Johnson, "how glad I am to see you.I had
given you up for lost, and bitterly blamed myself for allowing you to
go on your dangerous undertaking."First," answered Calhoun, "I must speak to General Beauregard," and,
saluting, he said: "General, I bring you heavy news."I feared it, I feared it, when the
Federals opened the battle this morning.I was just telling the Governor
as you came up that Grant would never have assumed the offensive if he
had not been reinforced."said Calhoun, "if I had only been a couple of days earlier; if you
had only attacked a couple of days sooner!""That was the calculation," answered Beauregard, "but the dreadful roads
retarded us.Then we did not expect Buell for two or three days yet.Our
scouts brought us information that he was to halt at least a couple of
days at Waynesborough.""So he was," answered Calhoun, bitterly; "and he would have done so if
it had not been for that renegade Kentuckian, General Nelson.He it was
who rushed through, and made it possible for Buell to be on the field
to-day.""Do you know how many men Buell has?""Three strong divisions; I should say full 20,000.""I thank you,
Lieutenant, for your information, although it is the knell of defeat.Yesterday we fought for victory; to-day I shall have to fight to save my
army."So saying he mounted his horse and galloped rapidly to the scene
of action."This is bad news that you bring, Lieutenant," said the Governor, after
Beauregard had gone."But tell me about yourself; you must have been in
trouble."At first I was very successful, and
found out that Nelson expected to be in Savannah by April 5th.I was
just starting back with this important information, information which
meant victory for our cause, when I was suddenly set upon and captured
before I had time to raise a hand.I was accused of being a spy, but
there was no proof against me, the only person who could have convicted
me being a cousin, who refused to betray me; but he managed to hold me
until my knowledge could do no good.""It looks as though the hand of God were against us," solemnly responded
Johnson."If you had not been captured, we would surely have attacked a
day or two earlier, and a glorious victory would have awaited us.But
now----" the Governor paused, choked back something like a sob, and then
continued: "There is no use of vain regrets.See, the battle is on, and
I must once more take my place in the ranks and do my duty.""Must fight in the ranks as a private soldier, as I did yesterday,"
replied the Governor calmly."I shall go with you," replied Calhoun.So side by side the Governor and his aid fought as private soldiers, and
did yeoman service.Just before the battle closed, in repelling the last
furious charge of the Federals, Governor Johnson gave a sharp cry,
staggered, and would have fallen if he had not been caught in the arms
of Calhoun.Loving hands carried him back, but the brave spirit had fled
forever.Thus died the most distinguished private soldier that fell on
the field of Shiloh.One of the first acts of Fred after the battle was over was to ride in
search of Robert Marsden.He found him lying in a heap of slain at the
place where the battery had been charged.A bullet had pierced the
center of the miniature flag, and it was wet with his heart's blood.Reverently Fred removed the flag, closed the sightless eyes, and gave
orders that the body, as soon as possible, be sent to Louisville.As he was returning from this sad duty, he thought of the errand given
him by General Nelson to hunt up the boy whom they saw capture the
colors.Riding up to the regiment, he made inquiry, and to his surprise
and delight found that the hero was Hugh Raymond.asked Fred, when the boy presented
himself."Yes, sir," replied Hugh, respectfully."You are the young officer who
got me released when General Nelson tied me to the cannon.I have never
ceased to feel grateful towards you.""Well, Hugh, General Nelson wants to see you again.""Don't want to tie me up again, does
he?"He saw you capture that flag and he is awful mad; so come
along.""General," said Fred, when he had found Nelson, "here is the brave boy
who captured the colors.""That was a gallant act, my boy," kindly remarked Nelson, "and you
deserve the thanks of your general.""It was nothing, General," replied Hugh."It just made me mad to have
them shake their dirty rag in my face, and I resolved to have it."He noticed Hugh more closely, and
then suddenly asked: "Have I not seen you somewhere before, my boy?""Yes, General," replied Hugh, trembling."On the march here, when you tied me by the wrists to a cannon for
straggling."Nelson was slightly taken back by the answer; then an amused look came
into his face, and he said, in a bantering tone: "Liked it, didn't you?""I was just
mad enough at you to kill you.""There is the boy for me," said Nelson, turning to his staff."He not
only captures flags, but he tells his general to his face what he thinks
of him."Then addressing Hugh, he continued: "I want a good orderly, and
I will detail you for the position."So Hugh Raymond became an orderly to General Nelson, and learned to love
him as much as he once hated him.Now occurred one of those strange psychological impressions which
science has never yet explained.A feeling came to Fred that he must
ride over the battlefield.It was as if some unseen hand was pulling
him, some power exerted that he could not resist.He mounted his horse
and rode away, the course he took leading him to the place where
Trabue's Kentucky brigade made its last desperate stand.Suddenly the prostrate figure of a Confederate officer, apparently dead,
attracted Fred's attention.As he looked a great fear clutched at his
heart, causing it to stand still.Springing from his horse, he bent over
the death-like form; then with a cry of anguish sank on his knees beside
it.He had looked into the face of his father.[Illustration: Springing from his Horse, he bent over the death-like
form.]Bending down, he placed his ear over his father's heart; a faint
fluttering could be heard.A ball had shattered Colonel
Shackelford's leg, and he was bleeding to death.For Fred to cut away the clothing from around the wound, and then to
take a handkerchief and tightly twist it around the limb above the wound
was the work of a moment.Tenderly was
Colonel Shackelford carried back, his weeping son walking by his side.The surgeon carefully examined the wounded limb, and then brusquely
said: "It will have to come off.""It's that, or his life," shortly answered the surgeon."Do it then," hoarsely replied Fred, as he turned away unable to bear
the cruel sight.When Colonel Shackelford came to himself, he was lying in a state-room
in a steamboat, and was rapidly gliding down the Tennessee.Fred was
sitting by his side, watching every movement, for his father had been
hovering between life and death.Colonel Shackelford faintly asked."Dear father," whispered Fred, "you have been very sick.Don't talk,"
and he gave him a soothing potion.The colonel took it without a word, and sank into a quiet slumber.The
surgeon came in, and looking at him, said: "It is all right, captain; he
has passed the worst, and careful nursing will bring him around."When the surgeon was gone Fred fell on his knees and poured out his soul
in gratitude that his father was to live.When Colonel Shackelford became strong enough to hear the story, Fred
told him all; how he found him on the battlefield nearly dead from the
loss of blood; how he bound up his wound and saved his life."And now, father," he said, "I am taking you home--home where we can be
happy once more."The wounded man closed his eyes and did not speak.Fred sank on his
knees beside him."Father," he moaned, "father, can you not forgive?Can you not take me
to your heart and love me once more?"The father trembled; then stretching forth his feeble arm, he gently
placed his hand on the head of his boy and murmured, "My son!In the old Kentucky home
Fred nursed his father back to health and strength.But another sad duty remained for Fred to perform.As soon as he felt
that he could safely leave his father, he went to Louisville and placed
in Mabel Vaughn's hands the little flag, torn by the cruel bullet and
crimsoned with the heart's blood of her lover.The color fled from her
face, she tottered, and Fred thought she was going to faint, but she
recovered herself quickly, and leading him to a seat said gently: "Now
tell me all about it."Fred told her of the dreadful charge; how Marsden, in the very front,
among the bravest of the brave, had found a soldier's death; and when he
had finished the girl raised her streaming eyes to heaven and thanked
God that he had given her such a lover.Then standing before Fred, her beautiful face rendered still more
beautiful by her sorrow, she said:

"Robert is gone, but I still have a work to do.Hereafter I shall do
what I can to alleviate the sufferings of those who uphold the country's
flag.In memory of this," and she pressed the little blood-stained flag
to her lips, "I devote my life to this sacred object."And binding up her broken heart, she went forth on her mission of love.She cooled the fevered brow, she bound up the broken limb, she whispered
words of consolation into the ear of the dying, and wiped the death damp
from the marble brow.Her very presence was a benediction, and those
whose minds wandered would whisper as she passed that they had seen an
angel.Calhoun Pennington bitterly mourned the death of his chief.He afterward
joined his fortune with John H. Morgan, and became one of that famous
raider's most daring and trusted officers.For some weeks Fred remained at home, happy in the company and love of
his father.But their peace was rudely disturbed by the raids of Morgan,
and then by the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederate armies.After the untimely death of Nelson, Fred became attached to the staff of
General George H. Thomas, and greatly distinguished himself in the
numerous campaigns participated in by that famous general.But he never
performed more valiant service than when he was known as "General
Nelson's Scout."I am, therefore, sure that
everything that is necessary will be found if carefully looked for.I will not, for this reason, enter into detail in respect of the manner
the Company took possession of this territory, or of the advantages
that may be found here both for the inhabitants and for the Company;
nor what compulsory services are demanded from the subjects in
Jaffnapatam, and the number of castes into which they are divided
and under which they are registered; nor will I specify here the
licenses for navigation and trade which have been given to them,
nor the changes which have taken place in the course of time with
regard to these and many other matters not stated here.Because, if I were to relate all these matters from the very beginning,
I would have to write several volumes instead of a few sheets of
paper.And this I do not intend to do, as I wish to be as brief
as possible.Moreover, sufficient information may be found in the documents
preserved at the Secretariate, which it would be well if Your Honours
would make yourselves familiar with.We must be always prepared to take
upon ourselves higher and more difficult posts whenever called upon,
and in so preparing ourselves we avoid confusion, and the Company
would never be in want of capable servants.I have no doubt you will all see the truth of what I say, yet, in
order the more clearly to convey the force of my suggestion, I will
specify here some of the documents which I consider it particularly
useful to obtain a general insight of.With regard to Jaffnapatam, I know of no better documents than
the Instructions compiled by Admiral Ryclof van Goens, Mr.Anthony
Paviljoen, and the Hon.Laurens Pyl, at present Councillor of India
at Batavia, left for this Commandement respectively on September
30, 1658, December 12, 1659, July 26, 1661, December 19, 1665, and
October 7, 1679, the latter [4] having been inserted in the General
Instructions left by His Excellency Ryclof van Goens, junior, on his
departure on October 3 of the same year, to take up the Governorship
of Ceylon.The directions in these Papers must be followed so far
as change of time and circumstances will permit.I could not avoid
mentioning these before entering into further details.It was the more necessary because so many observances, customs,
institutions, and singular methods of action are to be met with in
Jaffnapatam which are not found anywhere else or among any other
subjects of the Company, and also because they cannot be discovered
or understood without careful investigation and only in process of
time.Thus, although the most important matters have been successively
treated of in the service of the Company, yet all the necessary
information cannot be brought together here, and such a detailed
description would be beyond the purpose of ordinary instructions.I
will therefore only touch upon such matters as will be unavoidable
under the present circumstances.The mode of government during my absence will be the first point
to be decided upon; because formerly the Dessave, as second in the
Commandement, used to be appointed to preside, as may be seen in
the yearly Memoirs of Commandeur Floris Blom, left by him when he
had to travel beyond the Commandement; with the only restriction
that the Dessave was not to pass any orders for the warehouses,
the Treasury, workshops, &c., which were left to the Administrator,
although the Dessave was more often present within the Castle.Later
on, in the year 1694, on the death of the same Commandeur Blom of
blessed memory, the government of the whole of this Commandement was
entrusted to the Political Council by order of the Hon.Thomas van
Rhee, Councillor of India and Governor of Ceylon, and the Council of
Colombo.The government was then divided, and the authority limited,
and rules were laid down, which may be seen from the letters from
Colombo bearing date July 20 and August 23, 1694; but experience
has proved that this mode of government was not successful in the
best interests of the Company; because the subordinate officers and
the subject classes often did not know to whom they had to apply;
so that they were sent "from Pontius to Pilatus," as it is sometimes
said; which often caused unnecessary waste of time and delay in the
Service.I noticed this to have been the case when I was away from
this Commandement from the last of March till about the middle of
August this year, on the occasion of my being ordered to Colombo,
and the authority distributed according to the instructions contained
in the letter from Colombo of March 22.But I noticed later on that
the letters from Colombo were addressed to Mr.Rykloff de Bitter as
Dessave and Secunde of the Commandement and the other members of the
Political Council here; which was done again on October 16, 1696,
when it was anticipated that I had already left for Mallabaar by the
frigate "De Tamboer."In the letter from Colombo of April 18 the members of the Council
were also recommended to show the said Mr.de Bitter all the respect
due to his position as Dessave and Secunde in the Commandement;
so that it seems His Excellency the Governor and the Council wished
to re-introduce the former mode of government during the absence of
the Commandeur, seeing that the Company's affairs cannot be properly
conducted by such divided authority.This at least is my opinion,
and I intend to point out that in the absence of the Commandeur the
government here ought to be carried on according to the former lines,
and consequently the entire administration entrusted to the Dessave,
with the assistance of the members of the Political Council; and
that he must call the meetings both of the Council and of the Court
of Justice, and preside at both; and that he must further sign the
orders for the Treasury, the workshop, the arsenal, and even for
the warehouses, and in reference to any other of the effects of the
Company.This would be in compliance with the Instructions contained
in the letter from Colombo of December 5, 1696, where it is said that
no orders are to be passed here but by the person in authority.I
therefore think that, in the interests of peace and order in this
Commandement, the Dessave R. de Bitter should be in authority at such
times, especially as I have to be so far away.Besides, he lives just
in front of the town, and close by the Castle; so that he is always at
hand for those who require his assistance or instruction.But as the
Dessave lives outside the fortress, the giving of the watchword, the
closing and opening of the gate, and the supervision over the military
and their drill, could not very well be delegated to him.This must
therefore be left to the Captain as special chief of the Military;
unless the Dessave should occasionally remain within the Fort
overnight, in which case he will preform those duties.[(1)] [5]

With a view to prevent the impression being created that I had formally
given over this Commandement and entirely transferred the authority,
I will leave without making a written transfer of any of the Company's
effects.I merely entrust these to Your Honours' care and management;
but, on the other hand, it must be understood that I do not want to be
held responsible for any mistakes you might make during my absence.I
therefore, and in order to show that I do not relinquish my authority
in the Commandement, but only absent myself during the mission to
Mallabaar or until further orders from the Honourable the Government
of India are received, Your Honours are recommended to send to me
by Manaar and Tutucorin proper advices, and to communicate to me the
principal transactions that take place with regard to the Company's
service, in order that I may not be obliged on my return to ask what
had transpired or to look up these things in the books.It will be well
here to remind Your Honours of the order contained in the Resolution
passed by the Council of India on December 6, 1694, with regard to
all Administrators, viz., that they will be held responsible for all
cash or articles belonging to the Company which are found missing,
and that, if unable to justify themselves, they would have to replace
these within two months, or submit to be punished for their offence.[2]

Economy is the first matter which I have to recommend to Your Honours,
because this is not only constantly urged both from the Fatherland and
from Batavia, but also because it is beyond doubt that what is saved
in this manner will be pure profit.It must be understood, however,
that in using the word economy I mean care in the administration of the
Company's effects, and not a wrong economy.There are officers who take
this word in its narrowest sense, and, failing to have the necessary
repairs done in proper time in their endeavour to spend as little as
possible, create the necessity in the course of time of a complete
restoration, while the existing objects might have stood good for a
long time with a small timely expenditure.I must therefore recommend
Your Honours to read certain letters from the Hon.van Mydregt,
[6] bearing date July 4, 1690, and addressed to the establishment at
Jaffnapatam during his circuit on the coast of Madura.[3]

The Wanni is the largest division in this kingdom, and would also
be the most profitable to the Company if matters went on as they
ought to.It is from there that we have to obtain the elephants
which are sold here at considerable profit, as the proceeds of the
sale of elephants which are sent here for sale from Galle, Matura,
and other places in Ceylon cannot be credited to this Commandement,
as the profits are not retained here, but have been so far forwarded
to these places.With a view to secure the profits on the elephants
which are to be obtained from the Wanni, the Company has divided this
large forest and extensive territory into several Provinces, which
have been farmed out to Majoraals, known as Wannias, on the condition
that they should deliver yearly 42 1/2 alias.[7] This practice was
followed from the time that the Company first established itself here
up to the present day, but the results have proved that these Wannias
continually fail to deliver the tribute elephants, and it appears in
the Instructions of the late Mr.Paviljoen that their arrears in his
time were already 74 1/2 alias, when the Company had possessed this
territory only 7 or 8 years.In the returns for 1680 it will be seen
that these arrears had then increased to 313 alias.The whole of this
debt was remitted to them, but in 1694 again the arrears went up to
18 1/2 alias, and last year they had come up to 70 animals, namely:


    Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Konsjeynaar Ilengenarene
    Mudaliyar, for the Provinces of Lanengamo, Paleamblancolam,
    and Poedicoe 48 1/2 alias; Don Diogo Poevenellemapane Wannia,
    for the Provinces of Karkattemoele and Meelpattoe 18 alias; Peria
    Meynaar Oediaar, for the Province of Moeliawalle 3 1/2 alias;
    total 70 alias.It will therefore be necessary for Your Honours to endeavour to secure
as many elephants from these Wannias as possible, both in payment
of their arrears and of their present dues.This must be done, with
all kindness, and in compliance with the successive orders received
from His Excellency van Rhee, [8] Governor of Ceylon, and the Council
of Colombo, in order that this profitable trade may be maintained,
because there has been no lack of purchasers since the year 1689,
as the merchants from Golconda come over every year, and there is
a possibility that the Bengal Moors will also come over to purchase
elephants now that this passage has been opened.The price to be paid
to the Wannias for animals delivered above their tribute has been
stated in the letter of the Hon.van Mydregt of blessed memory,
sent here on April 3, 1690, from Tutucorin, while the Honourable the
Government of India, in their esteemed letter of December 12, 1691,
agreed to pay from 10 to 20 Rds.more for each animal, according
to their value.I fear, however, that it will take a long time
yet before it will be necessary to make such payment.The Wannia
Philip Nellamapane may be allowed to sell every year one elephant
on his own account to the Moors, in compliance with the orders
of the said Governor and Council at the meeting of May 11, 1696,
although Your Honours will find a positive refusal to the request
made by him and submitted to His Excellency van Mydregt by Commandeur
Floris Blom on October 20.The refusal was made in His Excellency's
answer of November 20.There are two other Wannias to whom the same
privilege has been granted, viz., Ambele Wannia and Chedoega Wannia,
the former holding the Province of Carnawel pattu, and the latter
that of Tinnemerrewaddoe.They obtained this permission because
their tribute is of little importance compared with that of the
other Wannias mentioned above, and because they had paid up their
arrears at the closing of the books last August.It seems, however,
that they also are not much inclined to deliver any elephants beyond
their tribute.Most likely they prefer the tithes which they draw
for ruling these Provinces to the payment they would receive from
the Company for the delivery of elephants.I will not state here my opinion as to the manner in which people ought
to be ruled or as to their behaviour, nor in what way the Company is
to expect the largest number of elephants and the greatest profits
from the Wanni; because I would then not only have to write too many
sheets of paper in doing so, but the subject would be of little
use to enlarge upon and only tend to confuse Your Honours in your
actions.I could merely advise you to follow the old instructions
of being kind and considerate.Meanwhile, however, Your Honours
are well aware of my principal views with regard to the Wannias,
as expressed in our conjoined letter to Batavia of August 12, 1695,
which letter might serve for your guidance; while you might also
read the letters exchanged between Colombo and Jaffnapatam during
the years 1674 to 1679, as also the resolutions passed with regard
to the Wannias during the same period.From the perusal of these
documents you will perceive whether or not my opinion of these people
is unfounded.Should you require more information with regard to the
Wannias and the Majoraals, you will find it in the Journal kept by
Commandeur Laurens Pyl, at present Councillor of India, on his visit
to that large forest in 1675 during the months of August to December,
and in another Journal written by me in July, 1692, when I accompanied
the late Commandeur Floris Blom also on a visit to the Wanni.These Wannias, by birth subjects of the Company and by descent no
more than ordinary caste Bellales, have in the course of time become
very conceited, and imagine that the title of Wannia is one invested
with awe and so important that, although they have received it from
the Company, they do not need to respect the Company or those placed
in authority here; and they seem to be in doubt whether they ought to
show their due obedience by appearing before its officers.It was on
this account that His Excellency van Mydregt gave special orders in
his reply of November 29, 1690, that one of the Wannias should always
stay at the Castle, each taking his turn for three months.Why this
order has not been carried out I do not know.Moreover, it appears
that Don Philip and his son, the young Don Gaspar, Master of the Hunt
in Ponneryn, together with his brother-in-law Don Gaspar Ilengenarene
Mudaliyar, has gone to Colombo instead of presenting himself here at
the Castle, as I had summoned them to do, as may be seen in the ola
of January 14, 1696, and in the resolutions of Council of the 16th
of the same month.I do not know how they obtained audience, but
they were received with even greater honour than they ever received
from the Governors or Commandeurs here.This was the first time they
ever went to Colombo.Still less am I able to say what transpired
between them and the Government of Colombo, because when I was there
I was not admitted to the meetings of the Political Council, and was
only an eye-witness of the outward show.I do not also know for what
reason the said Wannia Majoraals were kept here since their return,
and why they were not sent back to their forest for the capture of
elephants, unless it was because they acted as adjutants or auxiliaries
to the Opperkoopluyden [9] Jan van Keulen and Pieter Petitfilsz, as
I heard that during my absence they acted as Commissioners in this
Commandement.Perhaps these matters are better known to Your Honours
than to myself, because you were present here at the time.Yet I do not
know whether you realize that this action has made these people more
conceited than ever, and that they mention it here exultingly.This
is proved also by the fact that their arrears have greatly increased
since this trip to Colombo, and I have been privately informed that
the Master of the Hunt, Don Gaspar Nitcheachaderayen, has, on his own
authority and as if he were a sovereign, caused one of the Lascoreens
and one of the hunters of his father-in-law, the old Don Gaspar, to
be put to death; which has caused great enmity between these two and
Don Philip Nellamapane.It is also said that the old Don Gaspar is
desirous of revenging himself for this action, so that two people who
were such great friends and made such a stir here by going to Colombo
have not only become bitter enemies, but by this murder have also
given cause for consequences of a serious nature.It will therefore
be Your Honours' duty not only to hold an inquiry with regard to
this matter when an opportunity offers, but also to watch the future
conduct of these people.In the beginning of 1696 some Waddassen
[10] also entered the lands of the Wannia Don Diogo Poevenellemapane
and committed acts of hostility, whereby the brother of Cottapulle
Oediaar, cousin of the said Don Diogo, had been killed, because the
latter wrote an ola to the Administrator Biermans while I was away at
Colombo and the Dessave was commissioned to the pearl fishery.As he
complained publicly to both of us in the month of October of the same
year, saying that this happened for no other reason than because he
would not act in collusion with Don Philip Nellamapane or join with
the seditious company on their trip to Colombo, knowing that he could
find here competent rulers.Chedoegawale Mapane of Tinnemerrewaddoe
spoke to the same effect.Amblewanne, whom Your Honours wanted to
take his turn of staying here at the Castle, has been prevented from
doing so by the severe illness of one of his friends.I am obliged
to mention all these particulars here in order that Your Honours may
be able to keep an eye on the Wannias and their conduct.I wished to
do more in this matter, and would have made an effort to discover
and punish the murderers, but I was not in a position to do this
because it seems that the Government of Jaffnapatam has no longer
any influence in Colombo.This is apparent from the fact that while
these Wannias were not only heard, but also treated with great honour,
unknown to their ruler, I was even personally insulted by being kept
out of the Political Council.I considered it inadvisable on my part
to bring any charges against them at that time, and I think it would
be for Your Honours to do thus.[4]

Mantotte, Moezely, and Pirringaly are just as important to the
Company with regard to the capture of elephants as the Wanni; but
these Provinces are not under the subaltern rule of any native chief,
but are ruled directly by the Company through officers paid by the
Company.In Mantotte and Moezely there is an Adigar, paid by the
Company, whose work it is to supervise the elephant hunt and the
cultivation of the arable fields.For the latter the Company exacts
tithes, as from the Wannia Majoraals in the Wanni.The inhabitants
of Pirringaly, who were for some time ruled by Wannias, appealed in
1692 to the Commandeur Blom to be relieved of that servitude, and
this was granted to them on condition that they yearly delivered to
the Wannias 2 alias for this freedom.Since then they have been ruled
by their own Moete Carres or Masters of the Hunt, which arrangement
has proved to be very satisfactory, as may be seen from the Trade
Accounts, which show that these people, as well as the hunters of
Mantotte, Moezelypattoe, and Setticoulang have delivered a large
number of elephants at Manaar, and would have delivered more were it
not that a great many animals had died on the way.Further particulars
on this subject may be found by Your Honours in a certain report of
September 13, 1690, submitted by Commandeur Blom to His Excellency
van Mydregt of blessed memory, in the margin of which His Excellency
wrote instructions bearing date October 7 of the same year, where
you will find the most important particulars as to the troubles on
the borders of the Wanni.Your Honours may also read a short Memoir
by the late Commandeur Anthony Paviljoen, dated July 28, 1662, and
addressed to the Adigar of Mantotte.This office is held at present
by Dimingo Rodrigues, who was transferred from the same office in
Ponneryn by order of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo, as contained in their letter of October 13, 1696.He was sent
to Mantotte to take the place of the native Alepander Ananaal, who in
the same letter was dismissed from his office, although, as this was
done without my knowledge, I am not in a position to state the reason
therefor.Some other native officers were likewise dismissed from
their offices in this Commandement without communication with me, as
you may see from my letter to Colombo of October 15, 1696.The hunters
in the Provinces of Mantotte, Pirringaly, and Moezely, who, as stated
above, have shown great diligence in the capture of elephants and
still continue to do so, must be protected from any ill-treatment on
the part of the Adigar or any of the officers at Manaar or elsewhere,
in order that they may not be discouraged and lose their interest in
the work, which would be prejudicial to the Company.The price paid by
the Company for each elephant is stated in a document forwarded by His
Excellency van Mydregt to Jaffnapatam bearing date April 3, 1690.[5]

Ponneryn is the third Province from where elephants should be obtained
if all be well, because formerly when this Province was ruled by
an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave appointed by the Company, like the
Provinces Ilipoecarwe, Polweramcattoe, and Mantotte, no less than 25
alias on an average were obtained from there yearly, for which purpose
two kraals had been made.In 1690 this practice was changed, because
His Excellency van Mydregt, by decree of March 2 of the same year,
granted the revenue of Ponneryn to the young Don Gaspar, and those
of the other two Provinces to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that
the former should, as Master of the Hunt, see that all the elephants
which were found there were captured and sent down on account of the
Company; for which purpose 145 hunters and their Manigares were placed
under his command.The project for which this arrangement was made,
however, proved to be illusory, for no more than 74 elephants were
delivered by the Master of the Hunt in 7 years' time, while according
to the previous account 175 animals ought to have been delivered.This
means a loss to the Company of 101 elephants during the same period,
besides the tithes of the harvest for these three Provinces, while,
moreover, we had to continually hear complaints from the inhabitants of
maltreatment on the part of the said Wannias, as happened again lately
when the Dessave De Bitter visited Ponneryn.They are not satisfied
with the revenues mentioned above, but consider themselves rulers
over the inhabitants, which was never meant by His Excellency van
Mydregt, and they were always prevented from asserting themselves as
such, as may be seen from a report by Commandeur Blom on Jaffnapatam,
submitted to His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo on
August 28, 1692.About a year after the issue of the deeds of gift of
the tithes, His Excellency proposed to change this practice again,
and in a document of March 29, 1693, he repeated this proposal,
saying that he had already given orders for a general elephant hunt
on account of the Company in the said Provinces, in which both the
hunters and the inhabitants were to take part.Why this order was not
carried out I cannot say; but I know that already, within six months
after the issue of the deeds of gift, he noticed that both these Don
Gaspars had been favoured too much.This may be seen from a letter
from His Excellency dated July 4, 1690, to Jaffnapatam.For these
various reasons I have recommended that the form of government in
the Wanni should be changed, as would appear in our conjoined letter
to Batavia of August 12, 1695.Many more reasons might be brought
forward, but it would be trouble in vain.I therefore recommend
Your Honours to strictly follow the orders of His Excellency the
Governor and the Council of Colombo as contained in their letters
of October 13 and November 21, 1696, in favour of the said Wannias,
because Messrs.van Kuilen and Petitfilz, who were commissioned to
investigate this matter, declared that the inhabitants on the borders
of the Wanni are quite content and well satisfied.There is no use
therefore in our saying anything, although my experience and that of
the Dessave have proved quite the contrary.I cannot help for this
reason making a speculative calculation of the amount which the Company
has lost since the conquest of this territory by the non-payment of
tributes and arrears in the Wanni and Ponneryn.If each animal be
calculated on an average to be sold at Rds.350, or 1,050 Florins,
as may be considered to be the case, the amount would be:--


                                                                 Fl.For 1680 discharged from the delivery of 313 alias:
    estimated price                                         328,650
    For 1694 discharged from the delivery of 18 1/2 alias    19,425
    For present arrears                                      73,500
    For arrears over 7 years in Ponneryn                    106,050

               Total                                        527,625


This then is the loss the Company has suffered through the Wannias,
besides the many annoyances and indirect losses through the inhabitants
and the subjects in Jaffnapatam, which might be pointed out, but
which I will not do here for the reasons stated above.[6]

The trade here is not very important and does not amount to much,
except that in elephants, which was renewed chiefly by His Excellency
van Mydregt since 1689; because the merchants from Golconda and
Tansjouwer [11] had neglected this trade for some years, having driven
up the prices by bidding against each other at the public auctions.The
endeavour to interest them again in this trade has been successful;
the more so because the price for tuskers and elephants without tusks,
as also for that of infirm animals has been limited and regulated
in the letter of April 3, 1690, often previously referred to.The
principal people in Golconda address their payment orders to Philip
Sangere Pulle or the Brahmin Timmersa, whom they have chosen as their
agents, while the Company employs them as brokers in this trade.This
is found to save much trouble in the distribution and selling of the
animals and in feeding and transporting them when sold, because these
brokers procure the provisions and vessels, giving an account to the
merchants.This course was followed from the time the Company took
possession of this territory up to 1696, but Sangere Pulle died in
1695, and the Brahmin Timmersa has been discharged from his office,
because His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo gave
instructions, in their letter of August 23 last, that the trade in
elephants with the Moors at Golconda should be carried on in future
without any agents or brokers.This office was accordingly taken
off the trade accounts in compliance with the said order, after the
accounts with the merchants and between them and the agents had been
settled.This has brought about a great change, as may be seen from
the resolutions of December 17 of the same year, where it is stated
that these people intended to give up the trade for the reasons just
mentioned, as is known to Your Honours; but it is to be hoped that this
new Ordinance which was issued without communication with, or advice
from, the Commandeur of Jaffnapatam, may not have the serious effects
which are feared.Your Honours are also aware with how much bickering,
cavilling, dispute, and vexation, the trade in elephants was kept
up last year, so that about 161 animals were sold on behalf of the
Company for the sum of Rds.It is to be hoped that the sale
will increase; but I must seriously advise Your Honours to strictly
adhere to the above-mentioned rule, although it was made without my
advice or opinion being asked; unless their Excellencies at Batavia
should not agree with the view of His Excellency the Governor and
the Council of Colombo and send other orders.Besides the trade in elephants the Company deals here only in pepper,
about 40,000 or 50,000 lb.of which is sold yearly; some copper,
spiaulter, [12] a little pewter, a small quantity of powdered sugar,
about 300 or 350 ammunams of Ceylon areca-nut, which are sold to the
inhabitants, and a few other articles of little importance which
are sold to the Company's Dutch servants, amounting altogether to
no more than Rds.7,000 or 9,000 a year.Several endeavours have
been made to extend the trade, and an effort was made to introduce
here the linen manufacture from Tutucorin and Coromandel, but so far
without success, as may be seen from the minutes of the meeting of
the Council of Ceylon of January 22, 1695, where I brought forward
several questions with regard to this matter.It was proposed there
to allow private persons in Jaffnapatam to carry on a trade in cloth
on the payment of 20 per cent.duty, which proposal was approved
by Their Excellencies at Batavia by their letter of December 12 of
the same year, but this subject will be treated of under the head of
Leases.Considering further means of extending the Company's trade, it
struck me that Jaffnapatam was not only better situated than Calpetty
for the areca-nut trade with Coromandel, but also that the roads
through the Wanni to the Sinhalese areca-nut forests are very good,
so that the nuts could be transported from there in Boyados.[13] In
our letter of October 26, 1694, to Colombo, I proposed that this should
be done, which proposal was referred by His Excellency the Governor
and the Council of Colombo to Their Excellencies at Batavia.In
their letter of December 12, 1695, our Supreme Government expressed
themselves in favour of this proposal, but in a later letter of July
3, 1696, this was cancelled, although it is beyond doubt that this
way of transport of the areca-nut would be more advantageous to the
Company.This may be seen from the fact that the Portuguese, when they
were here, followed the same practise, and with good success as I was
told.I will now leave the subject of areca-nut and revert to that of
elephants.Many of these animals have been left here after the last
sale in 1696, because the purchasers were afraid of meeting with a
north wind on their voyage.Many vessels will be required to transport
not only these animals but also those that will be sold during the
next southern season.There being no agent now, the purchasers will
have to look out for themselves.And it will be necessary for Your
Honours to give them all possible assistance in order that they may
not be entirely discouraged and give up this trade.Your Honours
must also inquire whether any suitable vessels are to be procured
here which could be sent to Colombo or Galle in March or April, for
the transport from there of the Company's elephants fit for sale: in
compliance with the proposals contained in the correspondence between
Colombo and Jaffnapatam of April 13 and July 11, 1695, and especially
with the orders from Their Excellencies at Batavia in their letter of
July 3, 1696, wherein this course was highly approved.The fare for
these private vessels is far less than the expenditure the Company is
put to when its own vessels are used to transport the elephants from
Galle round about Ceylon to Cougature.If the latter course has to be
followed, care must be taken that the animals are carefully landed at
Manaar, in order that they may be fit to be transported further by land
to the place of their destination.It will also be necessary to have
some more of these animals trained for the hunt; because at present
the Company owns only about 6 tame ones, while there should be always
about a dozen; not only in order to fetch the elephants from Manaar
and to tame the wild animals, but also to assist the Wannias in case
they should capture a large number of elephants, when these animals
would be useful in the shipping of those sold to the purchasers.This
is not a regular practice, but is followed sometimes at their request
when any animals are to be shipped which are not sufficiently tamed
to be led into the vessels by themselves.Nothing more need be said
with regard to the elephants, except that there are about 6 animals in
the stables besides the 6 for the hunt mentioned above.It is to be
hoped that this number will soon be considerably increased, and the
prices must be regulated according to the instructions contained in
the letter from Colombo of January 16, 1696, and in compliance with
the decision arrived at on certain questions brought forward by the
late Commandeur Blom in the Council of Ceylon on February 17, 1692,
and agreed upon on February 19 following; while also, and especially,
the instructions from Their Excellencies at Batavia contained in their
letter of January 4, 1695, must be observed, where they order that
no animals are to be sold or sent except for cash payment, so that
there may be no difficulty in recovering the amount.(7)

The trade with the Moors from Bengal at Jaffnapatam and Galle has
been opened by order of the Honourable the Supreme Government of India
in terms of their letter of August 20, 1694.It is expected that the
trade with the Moors will greatly benefit this country, because the
inhabitants here are continually in want of grain and victuals, which
are imported by the Moors.Some years ago, when food was very scarce in
Coromandel, the English at Madraspatnam stopped the Moorish vessels on
their way hither, and bought up all their rice, which was a great loss
to Jaffnapatam.If the Moors could be induced to come here in future
with their rice, butter, sugar, cadjang, [14] &c., which are always
very much in demand, it must be seen that they are fairly dealt with,
and not discouraged from coming to this country.Perhaps they also
would buy some elephants if it happened that the Company had too many,
or if too few purchasers should arrive here from Golconda.But if the
demand for these animals at Golconda continues as it has done for the
last few years, we would not need the aid of the Bengal Moors in this
matter, although in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies at
Batavia they may be accommodated with a few elephants if they urgently
request them.It is the intention besides to sell to them the Ceylon
areca-nut; as we cannot as yet transport it through the Wanni, His
Excellency the Governor and the Council at Colombo must see that the
areca-nut from Calpetty or Trincomalee is sent here, in compliance
with the instructions of Their Excellencies at Batavia as contained
in their letter of July 3, 1696.Your Honours must therefore send in
the orders in due time if the Moors continue to come here, because
we cannot sell to them the Chiankos, [15] it being the intention of
Their Honours at Batavia, according to their letters of January 4 and
February 12, 1695, that this sea-product should be chiefly transported
to Bengal on behalf of the Company.On the other hand the diving for
Chiankos at Manaar is of so little importance that it is hardly worth
while mentioning here, and they are also very small, so that it is
not likely that the Moors would be willing to pay 12 pagodas a Cour,
as was ordered in a letter from Colombo to Jaffnapatam of March 23,
1695.With regard to the further restrictions put upon the trade with
the Moors, Your Honours must observe the instructions contained in
the letter of January 4, 1695.(8)

The inhabitants of this territory, who are really a perverse
race, are far too numerous to be maintained by the produce of this
Commandement.This had been expected at the beginning of the Company's
rule, when the late Commandeur, Anthony Paviljoen, stated in his
Instructions that there were about 120,000 subjects.How much worse
must this be now, when, as shown by the last Census, there were of the
people known alone, 169,299 subjects here and in Manaar.I think there
would be far more if all those who hide themselves in order to escape
from taxes and servitude be included.All these inhabitants are divided
into 40 different castes, which are described in the Thombo, so that
I will not name them here, as this would involve too much prolixity,
especially if I should state what kind of services, impositions,
&c., each one is liable to.All this I imagine to be well known to
Your Honours; because the late Mr.Blom had given a detailed and
accurate account of these matters in his report of August 20, 1692,
and I could only re-write what has been already described by others;
I therefore refer to the said manuscript, where, besides this subject,
much information may be found with regard to other matters concerning
Jaffnapatam.In the same document is also found a comparison between
the revenue of the Commandement, with the taxes and duty it has to
render to the Company, in the payment of which it has been greatly met
by the Honourable the Supreme Government of India as will be shown
below.In order to prevent any misapprehension during my absence,
I will state here the amount of the income of the Company during the
last year, viz., from September 1, 1695, to the end of August, 1696,
inclusive, viz.:--


                                                Rds.Rent from lands, trees, and gardens      16,348.3.4 3/4
    Tithes                                    8,632.7.3 3/4
    Poll tax                                  5,998.1.0
    Officie                                     865.2.0
    Adigary                                   1,178.3.0 1/2

             Total                           33,020.10.2
    Revenue of Manaar                           879.10.2
                                             ===============
                                             33,900.9.0     [16]


From this amount of Rds.33,020.10.2 the following expenditure must
be deducted, viz.:--


                                                    Rds.Payment of 216 Majoraals at Rds.2 each         432.0.0
    Payment of 218 Cayaals at Rd.1 each            218.0.0
    Payment of 8 tax collectors                     320.3.7 3/4
    Payment of 8 Sarraafs [17] or Accountants        32.3.0 1/2
    For elephants delivered in lieu of poll tax and
    land rent by the tamekares to the value of      373.4.0 1/2
                                                  ==============
                     Total                        1,375.8.1 1/4 [18]


So that Jaffnapatam had from this a clear revenue of Rds.31,645.2.3/9
last year, which is the second in importance of the sources of revenue
which the Company derives from this Commandement, besides the profit on
the sale of elephants.So far the land rents have only been calculated
in the Mallabaar books.We had therefore to depend entirely on the
native officers who were employed in this work and had to translate
the accounts; but the Hon.the Extraordinary Councillor of India,
Mr.Laurens Pyl, when he was Commandeur of Jaffnapatam, very wisely
introduced the practice of having all the fields, trees, houses, and
gardens of the inhabitants indicated on maps, and of estimating the
impositions of the tithes, and thus compiling a Dutch instead of the
Mallabaar Thombo.Because, when a description was made in Mallabaar,
in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia in 1675
and 1677, the yearly revenue of the Company increased by no less than
Rds.12,204 and 17/40 fanams.But as the natives were not supposed
to have done the work satisfactorily, it was again undertaken by a
committee of Dutch surveyors, who, however, wrote a great deal but
did not start the work in the right way, and it was never properly
completed.The new description of lands had however become so urgently necessary
that His Excellency the Commissioner-General left orders that this work
should be started afresh, ignoring what had been done already.During
the government of Commandeur Blom this work was commenced again, some
soldiers who were qualified surveyors being employed in it, as well
as such Cannecappuls [19] as were required by the Thombo-keeper to
do the writing, while one of the surveyors prepared the maps of the
fields which had been surveyed.This was done with a view to obtain
a plan of each particular field and thus recover the proper rents,
and also to fix the boundaries between the different properties.Maps
are also being prepared of each Aldea or village and each Province,
of which our authorities in the Fatherland desire to receive a
copy as stated in their letter to Batavia of August 27, 1694, which
copies must be prepared.On my arrival here from Batavia in 1694, the
Thombo-keeper, Pieter Bolscho, pointed out to me that this description
of land was again unsatisfactory, and that it would not serve its
purpose, as stated by me in the Annual Compendiums of November 30,
1694 and 1695.It was therefore necessary to have this work done for
the third time, and to measure again all the lands which had been
surveyed already.This time a scheme was drawn up with the help of the
said Mr.Bolscho, and the work has succeeded so well that the Province
of Walligamme, which alone extends over about half of this territory,
has been completely surveyed, and will from the last of August yield an
increase of revenue of Rds.1,509.5.23 or Fl.4,527.3.4 yearly.I have
already written and sent out the bills, as a warning to the people
to prepare for the payment, and the tax collectors are responsible
for the recovery of the amount; so that the small expenditure of this
new description will be recouped, and the inhabitants have no cause
of complaint, because they are only asked to pay their due to the
lord of the land as they ought to have done long ago.There is also
to be recovered an amount of Rds.500.2.5 for some small pieces of
land which were sold on behalf of the Company in 1695 in the village
of Copay, which no one appears to have demanded, because I was in
Colombo and the Dessave in Negapatam at the time.This must be done
now, especially as the expenditure of the new description of lands
has, by order of Their Honours contained in the general resolutions
of October 4, 1694, been written off the general revenue, to which
must therefore be now transferred the amount gained thereby, as also
the sum of Rds.288.7 which has been received by the survey of some
lands in Sjeroepittie, Wallalay, and Nierwely, which were occupied and
cultivated by the inhabitants, but for which they did not pay any rent
while we had the old Thombo, and which we left to them for payment as
they had cultivated them.This was in compliance with the instructions
contained in the reply to our letter to Colombo of August 22, 1695,
received December 15 following.If any one among you should not quite
understand this new description of lands, he may find it useful to
read certain instructions left by Governor Laurens Pyl with regard
to this subject on February 1, 1679, for the Committee appointed
to do this work, which instructions must be still observed so far
as they are applicable to the present circumstances.Your Honours
will most likely be aware also of the extensive Memoir compiled on
my orders by the said Mr.Bolscho, and submitted to the Council on
December 15, 1696, and of the reply thereto, as also of the report by
Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692, on the same subject, to which documents
I here refer.The surveyors are at present at work in the Province of
Waddemoraatsche, where they have with them two Mudaliyars, in order to
settle small differences which might arise among the inhabitants when
their lands are being surveyed.The Mudaliyars act as arbitrators in
the presence of the Majoraals of the villages, but important matters
must be brought before the Dessave, to be disposed of by him or by
the Court of Justice or the Civil Court according to the importance
of the case.The Dessave must see that the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Pieter
Bolscho, receives all the assistance he requires, and also that the
natives who have to serve him in this work are kept in obedience, in
order that he may not be discouraged and lose the zeal he has shown
so far in the service of the Company in this difficult work.Once
this work is completed it will not be required to be done again,
and we will be able then to prepare separate lists not only of each
Province, but also of each village; so that at any time the credits
or the debits of each tax collector may be seen.[9]

The tithes are a tax levied on the harvest, and are paid in money.Last
year it amounted to the sum of Rds.8,632.7.3 3/4, as shown in the
above account, and treated of at length in the report of August 20,
1692.I need not therefore dilate on this subject, and only wish to
state that I do not agree with the concluding portion of that report,
where it is stated that this tax is too heavy, and might be reduced to
half the amount as requested by the inhabitants, for which many reasons
are given pro and con.I think that it can be proved sufficiently that
the inhabitants are able to easily pay this imposition of the tithes;
not only because they have never complained against it since the year
1690 during the stay of His Excellency van Mydregt, when they knew
His Excellency had the power to grant their request without waiting
for further instructions.On that occasion the people of Jaffnapatam
tried every means of obtaining their wish, but it may be proved that
since that time they have become more prosperous--a subject which
may be dealt with perhaps later on.That the payment of the said
tithes cannot be very difficult for them is proved by the fact that
if half of the amount, viz., Rds.4,316, be divided over the total
number of inhabitants, the rate for each individual amounts to but
very little.It is stated as a fact that the rich people possess
the largest number of fields, but this shows that they do not need
a reduction of the tithes.[10]

Besides these tithes, one-tenth is also paid for the forests, mud
lands, &c., which have been granted for cultivation by the successive
Dessaves to different persons with the promise of exemption from any
impositions for a period of 3, 4, 6, or more years; on the expiry
of this period taxes must be paid.As I think that the Majoraals
do not look after these matters sufficiently well, and do not give
notice in time, the Dessave will have to investigate the matter and
see that the tenth of the harvest is brought to the Company's stores,
especially because the natives do not hesitate to steal or keep back
their dues if they are not kept constantly in fear of punishment.The poll tax, shown above to amount to the sum of Rds.5,998.1,
is of quite a different nature, because the rich and the poor pay
exactly the same rate.His Excellency van Mydregt on February 28,
1690, caused a decree to be issued, by which all the inhabitants
were exempted from the increase of poll tax which they had had to
pay since the year 1675, and which amounted on an average to from
Rds.But this exemption was only for the period of ten
years, and would have expired therefore in 1699, if the Honourable
the Supreme Government of India had not in a spirit of benevolence
decided by their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695, to make the
reduction a permanent one.This was made known to the inhabitants
of this Island on November 8 following.They showed themselves very
grateful for this generosity; but this must be considered sufficient
for the present, and they have not much reason now to insist upon a
decrease of the tithes also.The time for a renovation of the Head
Thombo, which has to be done every three years, has again arrived,
and the Ondercoopman and Thombo-keeper, Mr.Pieter Bolscho, and the
Ondercoopman, Mr.Roos, were sent on circuit on November 19, 1696, in
order to carry out this work.The names of the old and infirm people
and those who have died must be taken off the list, and the names of
the youths who have passed from the schools must be entered, in order
that those who owe Oely service may be known.It would also be useful
if the Dessave were occasionally present at this revision when his
other duties do not interfere with it, because an acquaintance with
this work is very desirable in a land regent.This new Head Thombo
must be completed by the end of next August, in order that the poll
tax and the fines for failure of performing Oely services, called
Chicos money, may be included in the Trade Accounts for each year,
as arranged by me.[11]

The Officie Gelden have also been described at length in the often
cited report by Mr.It is stated there
how these were first levied, as also how they were raised by the
Portuguese, and how they were paid during the rule of the Company.Some
of the castes had besides requested to be exempted from the payment of
these dues, and it is shown how this had been refused.Last year the
aggregate of this tax did not amount to more than Rds.It is
also spoken of in the Memoir of the Thombo-keeper, Piet Christiaansz
Bolscho, which was presented to the Council on October 20, 1696,
and the approval of which was conveyed by the letter from Colombo to
Jaffnapatam of November 16 following.The instructions contained in
this Memoir with regard to the Officie Gelden must still be observed,
the chief point being that they must be demanded for each individual
and not in the aggregate for the caste as a whole, as it has been done
thus far, so that the Majoraals and tax collectors had an opportunity
of appropriating a great part of the amount, which could never be
exactly calculated.That they could do this easily may be understood
when it is considered that most of the castes have increased in number,
while the Company has received no more than the lump sum due by each
caste.Knowing the covetousness and avarice of the tax collectors
and Majoraals, it could hardly be expected that they would excuse
any one from the payment; they must, on the contrary, have demanded
the money from each person and appropriated the surplus collected
by the increase in the number of people in each caste.Your Honours
must therefore take note of the matter, and the newly compiled lists
must show at a glance how much each aldea or parish owes; and as the
payment of this tax will be fairly distributed, no one will be wronged,
and the Company will receive its dues.[12]

The Adigary amounted last year to Rds.It is paid,
like the Officie Gelden, by every person without distinction, but
the only castes which pay it are the Bellales, the Chandes, and the
Tannatare.It dates from the time of the heathen kings, who used to
rule the country through Adigars, who were appointed over the different
Provinces, and the same method was followed by the Portuguese.These
Adigars were not paid by the king, but the inhabitants had to furnish
them with victuals.This was changed in the course of time by their
having to contribute to the payment of the Adigar, which did not
exceed one fanam for each person.Although the Company, which at
first followed the same practice, later on abolished this office,
except in the districts of Mantotte and Ponneryn, yet this imposition
of the Adigary remained in force on the same castes and is still
paid by them.No one however complains of it, but on the contrary,
they consider themselves to be the three oldest castes, and look
upon it as a mark of distinction and honour conferred on them above
the other castes, thinking that only they are worthy to contribute
to the maintenance of the king's Adigars.It is looked upon in the
same light by some other castes who consider themselves equal to
these three, such as the Maddapallys, Agambadys, Paradeesys, &c. I
think, therefore, that the Company could put this point of honour
to advantage and levy this tax from many other wealthy castes, who
would gladly out of jealousy allow the Adigary to be levied on them;
but this is mentioned here only en passant as a suggestion for the
consideration of wiser heads.[13]

The Oely service has, like the Officie Gelden, been described in
detail by the late Mr.Blom in his report of August 20, 1692, so
that I need not expand on this subject here.It may be seen from the
document just mentioned what castes up to this time have been obliged
to perform this service and how many men have to attend daily, as
also how they are classified.The same rules are still observed, but,
as I noticed during my residence, these people are very lazy in the
performance of their servitudes, although they are only required to
attend three days in every three months, or twelve days in a whole
year.I think this may be considered as a sign of their increased
prosperity; because they seem to find the means for paying their
fines for non-attendance without any trouble.This fine is only 2
Dutch stivers for each day, or 1 rix-dollar for the twelve days in
a year for each person, and the account for the year 1695 shows that
on the 24,021 men Rds.2,001.9 were paid in fines, and for the year
1696 for eight months (January to August) a sum of Rds.1,053.9 for
12,640 men; so that the Company during the period of 20 months had to
lose the daily labour of 36,661 men.It is therefore to be expected
that the works have been considerably delayed at the Castle, in the
loading and unloading of the vessels, at the wharf, at the gunpowder
mill, at the brick-kiln at Point Pedro, in the burning of lime and
the felling of wood on the borders of the Wanni, the digging and
breaking of coral stones on the islands, the burning of coals for
the smith's shop, &c. I therefore think that the said Sicos [20]
money ought to be doubled, so that they would have to pay 1 fanam
instead of 2 stivers for each day's absence; because I do not think
this must be considered as a tax levied on the inhabitants, but as
a fine and punishment imposed for negligence and as a means to make
them perform the necessary labour in order to prevent delay.But,
as these my Instructions are to be revised by His Excellency the
Governor at Colombo, Your Honours will no doubt receive orders from
him, I not being authorized to issue them.The reason why the last
account of the Sicos runs only over eight months instead of as usual
over a year is that I specially ordered this to be done because the
account used to run from the beginning to the end of each year,
while the Trade Accounts were closed on the last day of August,
which formerly closed on the last day of February, which was always a
source of confusion.In order to correct this I ordered the account of
the Sicos to be made up for the last eight months only.Meantime Your
Honours must not fail to see that these amounts are collected on behalf
of the Company, because out of it only Rds.180 has been received for
Patchelepalle for 1695; so that out of the above-mentioned amount
for the last 20 months the sum of Rds.2,975.1 is still due to the
Company.Besides the usual Caltementos received by the Collectors as
a compensation for the loss they suffer on account of those persons
who died or disappeared since the last revision of the Thombo, Your
Honour must also keep in mind that a small amount is to be paid yet
towards the Sicos for 1693.993.7,
and the greater part was received during my time.I do not know why
this was not collected before; perhaps it was due to the departure
of the late Mr.Blom to the pearl fishery in 1699, and his death
soon thereafter.[21] Because, when I arrived in December of the
same year from Batavia, I found matters in Jaffnapatam very much in
the same condition in which they were on my return from Colombo last
August, namely, many necessary things had been neglected and there was
great confusion.I will not enter into details over the matter here,
as I am not writing with direct reference to them.We will return
now to the subject of the Oely service, with regard to which I have
merely to add that it must be seen that the old and infirm people,
who are exempted from this servitude in the new Thombo, do not fail to
deliver such mats and pannegay [22] kernels for coals for the smith's
shop, as they are bound to according to the customs of the country;
because, although this is only a small matter, yet these things come
in very handy for the storehouses, vessels, pearl fishery, &c., while
otherwise money would have to be spent on these mats, an expenditure
which could be thus avoided.(14)

The tax collectors and Majoraals are native officers appointed by
the Company to demand and collect the poll tax, land rent, tithes,
and the Officie and Adigary rates which I have treated of above.They
also see that the natives perform such servitudes as they owe to
the lord of the land, and collect the Sicos money to which I have
referred, levied for neglect in attending for Oely service.The
expenditure in the appointment of these native officers is very
small, as may be seen from the foregoing account, considering that
these Collectors and Majoraals have to attend once in three months,
or four times a year, at the Castle to hand over one-fourth of the
full amount of the taxes for the year; so that the revenue is usually
received at the closing of the accounts.As this practice has proved
to be successful, the same course must be followed in future.I would
wish at the same time to point out here that the facility with which
these taxes are collected in Jaffnapatam is another evidence of the
improved condition of the inhabitants.In the year 1690 a change
was made in the appointment of the Collectors and Majoraals.Up to
that time all these and many of the Cannecappuls, Arachchies, &c.,
belonged to one caste, viz., that of the Bellales, being the farmers
or peasants.The principal of these belong to the family of Don Philip
Sangerepulle, from Cannengray, a native of evil repute; so much so,
that His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Laurens Pyl,
who was at the time Governor of Ceylon, issued an order on June 16,
1687, by which Commandeur Cornelis van der Duyn and his Council were
instructed to have the said Don Philip and several of his followers
and accomplices put in chains and sent to Colombo.He succeeded,
however, in concealing himself and eventually fled to Nagapatam, where
he managed to influence the merchant Babba Porboe to such an extent
that through his aid he obtained during the years 1689 and 1690 all
the advantages he desired for his caste and for his followers.This
went so far as to the appointment of even schoolboys as Majoraals
and Cayaals from the time they left school.His late Excellency van
Mydregt, who had great confidence in the said Babba, was somewhat
misled by him, but was informed of the fact by certain private letters
from the late Commandeur Blom during His Excellency's residence at
Tutucorin.Blom on July 4, 1690,
to at once make such changes as would be necessary, under the pretext
that some of the Majoraals were not provided yet with proper acts of
appointment issued by His Excellency.This may also be seen in the
answer to some points brought before His Excellency by Mr.Finding,
however, on my arrival from Batavia, that these appointments were
still reserved for the Bellales, through the influence of a certain
Moddely Tamby, who had formerly been a betel carrier to Sangerepulle,
later on a private servant of Babba Porboe, and last of all Cannecappul
to the Commandeur, and another Cannecappul, also of the Bellale caste
and a first cousin of the said Sangerepulle, of the name of Don Joan
Mandala Nayaga Mudaliyar, I brought this difficulty before my Governor
His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor of India, Thomas van
Rhee, on my visit to Colombo in the beginning of 1698.He verbally
authorized me to make the necessary changes, that so many thousands
of people should no longer suffer by the oppression of the Bellales,
who are very proud and despise all other castes, and who had become
so powerful that they were able not only to worry and harass the poor
people, but also to prevent them from submitting their complaints to
the authorities.Already in the years 1673 and 1675 orders had been
given that the Collectors should be transferred every three years;
because by their holding office for many years in the same Province
they obtained a certain amount of influence and authority over the
inhabitants, which would have enabled them to take advantage of them;
and it has always been a rule here not to restrict the appointment
to these offices to the Bellales, but to employ the Maddapallys
and other castes as well, to serve as a counter-acting influence;
because by this means the inhabitants were kept in peace, and through
the jealousy of the various castes the ruler was always in a position
to know what was going on in the country.All these reasons induced
His Excellency Thomas van Rhee to give me leave to bring about the
necessary changes, which have now been introduced.I appointed the
Collector of Waddemoraatje as my Cannecappul in the place of Moddely
Tamby, whose place I filled with the new Collector of the Maddapally
caste, while also a new Collector was appointed for Timmoraatsche
in the place of Don Joan Mandala Nayaga, whom the late Mr.Blom had
discharged from his office as Cannecappul of the Gate; because no two
Bellales are allowed to hold office in one place.He agreed with me on
this point, as may be seen from his report of August 20, 1692.I have
further transferred two Collectors in the large Province of Wallegamo,
so as to gradually bring about the desired change in the interest of
the Company and that of the other castes; but I heard that this small
change created so much disturbance and canvassing that I had to leave
the matter alone.The Bellales, seeing that they would be shut out from
these profitable offices and that they would lose the influence they
possessed so far, and being the largest in number and the wealthiest of
the people, moved heaven and earth to put a stop to the carrying into
effect of this plan so prejudicial to their interests.With this view
they also joined the Wannias Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar
Ilengenarene Mudaliyar in their conspiracies.The latter two, also
Bellales, well aware that they owed many elephants to the Company,
as stated at the beginning of this Memoir, and knowing that their
turn would also come, organized the riots in which the said Moddely
Tamby was the principal instrument.He was a man who first appeared
as a rebel, on the plea that, having been prosecuted by the Fiscaal
for many offences, he had been injured by a long imprisonment and
that this induced him to take revenge, these same two Wannias having
been then the first accusers who came to me complaining against this
man in the latter part of 1694.Perhaps later on they considered the
great assistance they received from him during the time of Babba
Porboe in obtaining the various privileges and favours.They also
probably understood that it was my intention to diminish the influence
of the Bellale caste, and were thus induced to take this course to
promote the welfare of their caste.I think that it was also out of
their conspiracies that the riots arose from which this Commandement
suffered during my absence in the months of May, June, and July.I
cannot account for them in any other way, as I have stated previously
when treating of the Wanni.I am obliged to repeat this here, in
order that Your Honours may be on your guard and watch the movements,
alliances, and associations of these Bellales and the Majoraals of the
Wanni; because although I may have persisted in bringing about the
desired changes, I preferred to leave the matter alone, seeing how
much annoyance this first attempt caused me, and how the obsequious
subjects of this Commandement are not only given audience in Colombo,
but are also upheld against their local ruler, whose explanation is
not only not asked for, but who is even prevented from defending the
interests of the Company at the place he had a right to do.I will,
however, drop this subject, although a great deal more might be said,
because I consider it will be useless to do so.I only advise Your
Honours not to make the slightest alteration in the appointment of the
native officers during my residence at Mallabaar, but to leave them
for the present in the state in which they wish so much to remain,
as this is a matter within the province of the Commandeur.Lascoreens
and Arachchies with their Canganes may, however, be discharged or
appointed according to their merits by the Dessave, in accordance
with the instructions of the late Admiral Rycloff van Goens, dated
February 26, 1661.In the case, however, of any of the Majoraals,
[23] Cayaals, [24] Pattangatyns, [25] Cannecappuls, or Collectors
resigning their offices or of being dismissed on account of misconduct,
the Dessave will be also authorized to provisionally appoint others
in their place without issuing the actens [26] until my return or
until the appointment of another Commandeur in my place, if such be
the intention of Their Excellencies at Batavia.Because no provision
has been made for such cases, which interrupt the regular course of
the administration.(15)

It must be also seen that the lower castes observe the rules with
regard to their costumes, &c., because I hear that here also corruption
has crept in, and that they do not wear their dress in the proper way,
do not cut their hair, and do not wear any golden rings in their ears,
so that they cannot be distinguished from the caste-people or Gonoradas
as they are called, who consider this an insult to them.A plackaat
on this subject was issued by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Governor
of Ceylon, on August 18, 1686.There will be little difficulty in
enforcing those rules if the Regent in this Commandement is allowed to
assume the authority which is his right, and which he must have if he
is to maintain the discipline required to carry on the operations of
the Company, for the people of Jaffnapatam are conceited, arrogant,
and stubborn.They bring false complaints against their rulers to the
higher powers if they find but the least encouragement, while on the
other hand they are slavish and cringe under the rod of their rulers so
long as they see that their authority is not disputed, but is upheld
by the Government.As they were so strictly held down to their duties
during the time of the heathen and of the Portuguese, not knowing any
other but their own immediate ruler, they often do not understand
the position of a subordinate ruler in the service of the Company,
and are not able to act with discretion when they find a way from
an inferior to a superior.It is not in accordance with the natural
government to which their ancestors had been accustomed.It must not,
however, be supposed that I ignore the fact that the mild government of
the Company always leaves a way of appeal for those of its subjects,
whoever they may be, when they consider themselves unjustly treated;
but I think that on the other hand the Company should likewise allow
their chiefs to punish the delinquents before they are permitted to
appeal to the higher powers.This I have found is not always observed
as regards Jaffnapatam, although it seems to me necessary that it
should be if our officers are not in the course of time to become a
laughing stock to the people.It is a well-known fact that the more
influential natives always try to oppress the poorer classes, and it
will be impossible to prevent their doing this if they are allowed
to become stronger than they already are.The Lascoreens, who are supposed to be soldiers, appear however to be
more useful in times of peace for the running of errands, the carrying
of letters, the communication of orders to and fro in the country,
and to summon the inhabitants, than they are in times of war for
the carrying of arms, for they have not the slightest idea of drill
or discipline, and are entirely wanting in courage.Yet we have to
employ them in these services, and it will be chiefly the duty of
the Dessave to see that those whose names are entered as Lascoreens
in the Hoofd Thombo are kept under discipline by their officers, and
also that their number is complete, so that they may be easily found
when suddenly wanted.It must also be observed that no men are entered
as Lascoreens who are bound to perform other services.The argument
brought forward by His late Excellency Commissioner van Mydregt in
his Instructions for Jaffnapatam of November 29, 1690, that it is
most difficult to reduce such people afterwards to their more humble
service is undoubtedly true and has been proved by experience.Those
whose names are at present entered in the Thombo as Lascoreens amount
to 834 men, both archers and pikemen, viz.:--


                Arachchies                    31
                Canganas                       4
                Lascoreens                   799
                                             ===
                                   Total     834


Of these, only 200 are paid, and sometimes less than that
number, according to circumstances, as may be seen in the monthly
accounts.They are commanded by two Mudaliyars, one over the archers
and one over the pikemen.The Lascoreens are paid only 7 1/5 fanams
per mensem, without rice, and they are required to be ready day
and night to carry orders.Their pay is certainly not too high,
especially in such times of dearth as we have had during the last
three or four years, but I hope that this may be prevented in future
to some extent when the Moors from Bengal come here more frequently
and the rice from Trincomalee and Cotjaar is received in the required
quantities.Otherwise I think that the request of the Lascoreens,
if they strongly urge it, should be complied with, namely, that they
may be paid Rd.1 per month should the dearth continue longer.But
this can only be done with the special permission of His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo, although the Commandeur
and the Council here have been authorized to grant this higher pay
by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, Councillor of India, on his visit to
Jaffnapatam on June 14, 1687, when this and other requests of the
natives were submitted to him.But, considering that besides the
180 or 200 Lascoreens there are also employed other native soldiers
in Mannar, Aripo, Calpentyn, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, who are
also drawn from the above-mentioned 834 men, and that they have to
be transferred every half year, it is desirable that the same rules
should apply to them all, especially because a number of them are
also employed in this Commandement in the felling of wood, some at
Point Pedro under the Vidaan of the Elephants, some at Kayts in the
dyeing industry, some under the Civil Council, others again under
the Collectors of taxes in the various Provinces, at the Passes,
under the clergy, the Fiscaal, and other of the Company's servants;
since in that way they will be best kept under discipline.This would
also prevent fraud, because each person would receive his pay direct
from the Company, while at present the two Mudaliyars mentioned above
have a chance of favouring those whom they prefer.For this and other
reasons Your Honours must see that the Lascoreens are transferred at
least once a year, if not twice.[16]

Slaves from the opposite coast are brought here in large numbers,
because the accounts state that from December 1, 1694, to the end of
November, 1696, no less than 3,589 slaves were brought across, on each
of whom was paid to the Company as duty for admittance the amount of 11
fanams, making a total of 39,424 fanams or 9,856 guilders.The people
of Jaffnapatam import these slaves only for their own advantage, as
they find the sale of these creatures more profitable than the trade
in rice or nely, these grain being at present very dear in Coromandel,
which again is a reason why these slaves are very cheap there, being
procurable almost for a handful of rice.As Jaffnapatam does not yield
a sufficient quantity of rice for its large population, I tried to
induce the inhabitants to import as much nely as possible, but to no
purpose.Therefore, considering that it is likely the scarcity of the
necessaries of life will increase rather than decrease, because the
Moorish vessels loaded with rice remained at Madraspatam, I thought
it best to open the passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa for the
inhabitants of Jaffnapatam.I did so because I was informed that grain
is very plentiful there and may be had at a low price, and also because
I found that this privilege had been granted to them already by the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India by Resolution of November,
1681.This permission was renewed in a letter of December 12, 1695,
but as this was cancelled in a letter from Colombo to Jaffnapatam
of January 6, 1696, this Commandement continued to suffer from the
scarcity of provisions.However, the price of rice was never higher
than Rd.1 a parra, and even came down to 6 fanams for a cut parra,
of which there are 75 in a last of 3,000 lb.The question arises,
however, whether the Company might not be greatly inconvenienced
by the importation of these slaves, because it seems to me that the
scarcity of victuals would be thus increased, and I do not consider it
advisable for other reasons also.It is true that the Company receives
a considerable amount as duty, but on the other hand these slaves
have to be fed, and thus the price of victuals will, of necessity,
advance.The people of Jaffnapatam are besides by nature lazy and
indolent, and will gradually get more accustomed to send their
slaves for the performance of their duties instead of attending to
them themselves, while moreover these slaves are in various ways
enticed outside the Province and captured by the Wannias, who in
times of peace employ them for sowing and mowing, and in times of war
strengthen their ranks with them.They also sometimes send them to
officers of the Kandyan Court in order to obtain their favour.Many
of the slaves imported suffer from chicken pox, which may cause an
epidemic among the natives, resulting in great mortality.The amount
derived from the duty on importation of slaves would therefore not
be a sufficient compensation.In my opinion this large importation
of slaves is also another evidence of the greater prosperity of the
inhabitants of this Commandement, as the purchase and maintenance of
slaves require means.[17]

Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting in
Jaffnapatam, and, as the matter is one which concerns the maintenance
of life, great attention must be paid to it if we are to continue to
exact from the inhabitants the dues they are paying now.It will be
found on calculation from the notes of the Tarrego [27] taken for
some years that the inhabitants consume on an average no less than
2,000 lasts of rice a year in addition to the quantity produced in the
Provinces, The Islands, the Wanni, Ponneryn, and Mantotte, so that it
is clear how necessary it is that the inhabitants are not only enabled
but also encouraged to import grain from outside.Besides that obtained
from the Bengal Moors, they may now also obtain rice from Tanjauwen,
Oriza, Tondy, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, as the latter passage has
been re-opened by order of the Honourable the Supreme Government of
India at Batavia in terms of their letter of July 3, 1696, which I
published in a mandate in Dutch and Mallabaar on October 1, 1696.From
this I expect good results in future for this Commandement.I also
hope that this will be a means of preventing the undesirable monopoly
of victuals, with regard to which subject I refer Your Honours to the
letter from Colombo of November 16, 1696, and the reply from here
of December 12 following, and I again seriously recommend to Your
Honours' attention this subject of monopoly, without any regard to
persons, as the greatest offences are undoubtedly those which affect
the general welfare.(18)

The native trade is confined to articles of little importance, which,
however, yield them a considerable profit, as many of the articles
found here are not found elsewhere.Thus, for instance, the palmyra
tree is not only very useful to them, as its fruit serves them as
food instead of rice, but they also obtain from it sugar, poenat, [28]
pannangay, [29] calengen, [30] mats, carsingos, [31] and caddigans [32]
or olas, and besides, the palmyra timber comes very handy whenever they
fell the trees.For all these sundries the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam
obtain good prices in Coromandel and Tondy, where also they sell
coconuts, kayer, [33] oil obtained from coconuts, and margosy, and
many other things which are not found in the places mentioned above,
or in Trincomalee and Batticaloa.These articles are rising in price
from year to year, so that they fetch two and three per cent.more
than formerly, and on this account the number of vessels along the
seacoast between Point Pedro and Kayts has increased to threefold
their number.With a view to prevent the monopoly of grain as much as
possible Your Honours are recommended to follow the same method I did,
viz., to order all vessels which come into Point Pedro, Tellemanaar,
or Wallewitte to go on to Kayts, as the owners often try to land in
these places under some pretext or other.They must be made to sell
their nely at the bangsaal or the public market, which is under the
supervision of this Castle; because if they unload their nely elsewhere
they do not bring it to the market, and the people not finding any
there have to obtain it from them at any price, which I consider to
be making a monopoly of it.Another product which yields a profit to
the inhabitants is tobacco.This grows here very abundantly, and the
greater part of it is sold by the owners without the least risk to the
merchants of Mallabaar, while the rest is sold here among their own
people or to the Company's servants.A part also is sent to Negapatam,
because the passage to Mallabaar is too dangerous for them on account
of the Bargareese pirates, who infest the neighbourhood.They also
make a good profit out of the provisions which the Company's servants
have to buy from them, such as fowls, butter, milk, sheep, piesang,
[34] soursop, betel, oil, &c., on which articles these officers have
to spend a good deal of their salaries, and even the native officers
have to devote a great deal of their pay to the purchase of these.The
inhabitants are also able to obtain a good deal as wages for labour if
they are not too lazy to work, so that, taking all in all, Your Honours
will find that the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam are more prosperous now
than they have been for some time, although it has been urged in some
quarters that they are oppressed and fleeced and are therefore in a
miserable condition.These people do not know or pretend not to know
that those reports have been circulated by some of the wealthiest
Bellales, because endeavours were made to maintain and uphold the
poorer castes against them.Their circumstances being so much better,
the people of Jaffnapatam ought not to hope for a decrease of the
tithes, as spoken of before.Nor did they ask for this during my
time, nor even referred to it, because at the general paresse [35]
of August 2, 1685, they made a unanimous declaration that they had
no request to make and no reason for complaint, and that they were
perfectly satisfied with the rule of the Company.This may be seen
in the Compendium of the last of November of the same year.In my
questions of January 22 of the same year several requests of theirs
had already been submitted, which had been all disposed of to their
satisfaction, as, for instance, that with regard to the free trade
in Batticaloa and Trincomalee already mentioned above, while the
other matters will be treated of later on.Blom would seem to recommend the decrease of the tithes in his
report of August 20, 1692, but he did not know at the time that so many
privileges would be granted to them.Although the granting of these is
of little importance to the Company, it is a fact on the other hand
that the prosperity of the inhabitants will also be an advantage to
the Company, because it enables them to pay their imposts and taxes
regularly, as witness the last few years.[19]

The coconut trees are the third source of prosperity granted to the
inhabitants, besides the free trade in Batticaloa and Trincomalee
and the reduced poll tax; because, in compliance with the orders from
Batavia of December 12, 1695, these trees would no longer be subject
to taxes in the new Land Thombo, the owners being obliged to feed not
only the Company's elephants, but also those which have been already
purchased by the merchants, with coconut leaves.Although this no
doubt is more profitable to them, as they are paid for the leaves
by the merchants, yet it is true that the trees yield less fruit
when their nourishment is spent on the leaves.But although Their
Excellencies at Batavia kindly relieved the people of their burden
in this respect, the duty was imposed again in another way when His
Excellency the Governor and the Council decided, in their letter of
October 13, that Jaffnapatam would have to deliver yearly no less
than 24 casks of coconut oil besides that which is required for use
in this Commandement and at Manaar.This, including what is required
at the pearl fishery, amounts according to my calculation to no less
than 12 casks.For this reason it will be necessary to prohibit the
export of coconuts.This order, like the one with regard to the reform
in the sale of elephants, was sent to us without previous consultation
with the Commandeur or the Council of Jaffnapatam; yet in the interest
of the Company I could not abstain from expressing my opinion on the
subject in my reply of November 1, 1696; but as the order was repeated
in a subsequent letter from Colombo as also in one of the 21st of
the same month, although with some slight alteration, I am obliged to
recommend that Your Honours should endeavour to put this order into
execution as far as possible, and not issue licenses to any one.I
do so although I expect not only that the farmer of the Alfandigo
(for the export of all articles permitted to be exported) will
complain on this account, and will pay less rent in future, but also,
and especially that the inhabitants will object to this regulation,
because they receive at least twice as much for the plain coconuts
as for the oil which they will have to deliver to the Company.This
will be so in spite of some concessions which have been made already
in the payment for the oil, upon their petition of June 14, 1687,
submitted to His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then Governor of Ceylon,
in which they stated that it was a great disadvantage to them to be
obliged to give the olas of their trees as food for the elephants,
and that they were now also prevented from selling their fruits,
but had to press oil out of these for the Company.[20]

The iron and steel tools imported by the Company did not yield much
profit, because there was no demand for them.The wealthy people
considered them too expensive, and the poor could not afford to
purchase them for the ploughing and cultivation of their fields and
gardens.They have therefore been stowed away in the storehouses.As
may be seen from the questions submitted by me to the Council of
Colombo on January 22, 1695, I proposed that the inhabitants should
be permitted to obtain these tools direct from Coromandel, which was
kindly granted by the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by
letter of December 12 of the same year.This may be considered the
fourth point in which they have been indulged; another is the license
given to them in the same letter from Batavia (confirmed in a letter
of July 3, 1696) that they may convey the products of their lands and
other small merchandise by vessel to Coromandel, north of Negapatam,
without being obliged to stop and pay Customs duty in the former place,
as they had to do since 1687.They must not therefore be restricted in
this, as I introduced this new rule as soon as the license arrived.[21]

The palmyra timber required by the Company for Colombo and Jaffnapatam
used to be exacted from the inhabitants at a very low price which
had been fixed for them.They had not only to deliver this, but also
that which some of the Company's servants demanded for their private
use at the same low rate, under pretence that it was required for the
Company; so that the owners not only lost their trees and what they
might obtain from them for their maintenance, but were also obliged
to transport this timber and the laths, after they had been split,
from their gardens for two or three miles to the harbours from which
they were to be shipped, either to the seacoast or to the banks of
the river.Besides this they had still to pay the tax fixed for those
trees in the Thombo.Moreover, it happened that in the year 1677
there was such a large demand for these planks and laths, not only
in Colombo but also in Negapatam, that no less than 50,687 different
staves and 26,040 laths were sent to the latter town on account of
the Company.Their Excellencies at Batavia, considering that such
a practice was too tyrannical and not in keeping with the mild,
reasonable, and just government which the Company wishes to carry on,
have lessened the burden of the inhabitants in this respect, and have
desired that in future no such demand should be made from them, but
that they should be allowed to sell this timber in the market.Further
particulars with regard to this matter may be found by Your Honours
in the letter from Their Excellencies to Ceylon of May 13, 1692, and
in the letter from His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo of April 29, 1695, which may serve for your guidance.This
may be considered as the fifth favour bestowed on the inhabitants,
but it does not extend to the palmyra planks and laths required by
the Company for the ordinary works in this Commandement or for the
Castle.These are to be paid for at the rate stated in the Trade
Account as paid formerly, because this is a duty they have been
subject to from olden times, and it is unadvisable to depart from
such customs without good reason, the nature of these people being
such that they would not consider it a favour and be grateful for it,
but if they were relieved of this they would continue to complain
of other matters.On the other hand they will, without complaint,
pay such duties as have been long customary, because they consider
themselves born to these.I therefore think it will be best to observe
the old customs.With regard to the purchase of planks and laths on
account of the Company, I found on my arrival from Batavia in this
Commandement that this had been done with the greatest carelessness,
the accounts being in a terrible disorder.I therefore proposed in
my letter of December 9, 1694, to Colombo that such purchases should
be made by the Dessave, as he, by virtue of his office, has the best
opportunity.This was approved of in the letter of the 22nd of the
same month, and since then a certain amount of cash, about Rds.100
or 200, has been handed to him for this purpose, and he accounts for
this money in the Trade Accounts and states how many planks and laths
have been delivered to the Company.In this way it may be always seen
how the account stands, and this practice must be continued.It must
also be seen that as many planks and laths are stored up at the outer
harbours for Coromandel and Trincomalee and at the inner harbours for
Colombo and our own use as will be possible without interfering with
the liberty granted to the inhabitants; because the demand both in
Negapatam and in Colombo is still very great, as may be seen in the
letter of February 10, 1695, to which I have referred.[22]

The felling of timber is a work that must receive particular attention,
as this is required for the repair of the Company's vessels, at
least such parts of them as stand above the water level.For repairs
under water no timber has so far been obtained in the Wanni that is
serviceable, as the timber there is liable to be attacked by a kind of
worm under water.Timber can be transported to the Castle only once
a year during the rainy season, when the rivers swell so much that
the timber which has been felled during the dry season can be brought
down to the Passes and from there to the Fort.Sometimes also timber
is felled near the seashore, when it is brought down along the coast
to Kayts or Hammenhiel by pressed Carrias or fishermen.Occasionally
some timber is also felled near the seacoast between Manaar and
Jaffnapatam, which is suitable for door posts, window frames, and
stocks for muskets and guns, while here also is found the timber for
gun-carriages, which comes in very useful, as the Fort must be well
provided with ammunition.Laurens Pyl for
this Commandement, bearing date November 7, 1679, [36] it is stated
in detail how the felling of timber is conducted and what class of
people are employed in this work.This subject is also dealt with
in the report by the late Mr.Blom of August 20, 1692, so that I
merely refer to these documents, and recommend that another and an
experienced person ought to be trained for the supervision of this work
in addition to the sergeant Harmen Claasz, who has done this work for
the last 25 years, and has gained much experience during his residence
in the forests of the Wanni, and knows exactly when the timber ought
to be felled, when it can be transported, and what kinds of trees are
the most suitable.Because it must be remembered that like all human
beings he also is only mortal.I therefore some time ago appointed the
soldier Laurens Hendriksz as his assistant.He is still employed in
the same capacity.As these forests are very malarious, there are but
few Dutchmen who could live there, and this is the more reason why Your
Honours should always see that an able person is trained to the work,
so as to avoid inconvenience some time or other.It is impossible to
employ a native in this work, because the Wannias would not have the
same regard for a native as for a European, and one of their caprices
to which they are so often subject might interfere with the work.[23]

Charcoal, made from the kernel of the palmyra fruit, is used here
for the smith's forge.In the Memoir referred to Your Honours will
also find stated by whom this is furnished to the Company.As I
noticed that the work in the smith's forge had to be discontinued
sometimes for want of charcoal, especially during the months of
August, September, and October, which causes great inconvenience to
the Government, I proposed to His Excellency the Governor and Council
that a quantity of smiths' coals from Holland should be provided.It must be used in times of scarcity, and the
people who are bound to collect and burn the kernel must be kept
to their duty, and compelled to deliver up the full extent of their
tax.The coals from Holland must be looked upon as a reserve supply,
to be used only when no pannangay kernels are to be had, as happens
sometimes when the inhabitants plant these seeds in order to obtain
from them a kind of root, called calengen, which they use as food.[24]

Bark-lunt is another article which the Company receives from the
inhabitants here without any expense.All inhabitants who go yearly
to the Wanni to sow and mow, consisting of about 6,000 or 7,000
and sometimes even 10,000 persons, and who pay 10 of these lunts to
the Wannias, have on their return at the Passes to pay a piece of
lunt each, 4 fathoms long, and for each cow or bull they have with
them and have employed in the Wanni for ploughing or have allowed
to graze there they also have to pay the same.This amounts to a
considerable quantity yearly, nearly 60,000 lunts.It is a matter
of little importance, but a great convenience, because not only the
garrison in this Commandement is thus furnished, but a large quantity
may also be sent to other places when required, as is done usually to
Negapatam and Trincomalee, for which a charge of 1 stiver a piece is
made, which amount is entered here with the general income and charged
to the said stations.Care must be taken that this duty is paid at
the Redoubts, but on the other hand also that not too much is charged
to these people, because I have heard complaints that sometimes more
than 4 fathoms of the lunt is demanded.This is unfair, because the
surplus is appropriated by persons who have no right to it.[25]

Coral stone, used for building purposes and for the burning of lime,
is found here in abundance.This also the Company obtains without any
expenditure, because it is dug up and broken by ordinary Oeliares.It
is also found at Point Pedro, where it is burnt into lime or otherwise
sent to the Castle in tonys or pontoons, where it is then either burnt
into lime, used for foundations or for the filling up of the body of
walls, which are then covered on the outside with cut coral stone,
as this makes them strong and durable.For some years the cut stone
has also been sent to Negapatam for the fortifications.This must be
continued until we receive notice that it is no longer necessary,
which I think will be soon, because I noticed that lately not so
much stone was asked for.From 1687 up to the present about 52,950
cut stones have been sent to this place.[26]

It may be understood from the above that lime is easily obtained here,
and without great expenditure.That which is required for the Company
here is delivered free of charge.For the lime sent to Negapatam 7
fanams are paid in place of 5 light stivers.[37] This is paid to the
lime burners at Canganture, who received an advance on this account,
of which a small balance is left.Meanwhile the Dessave de Bitter
informed us on his return from Coromandel that no more lime was
required there, but in order that the Company may not lose by the
advance made, a quantity of 8,000 or 9,000 parras of lime is lying
ready at Canganture, which must be fetched by the Company's vessels
in March or April and brought to Kayts.This, I think, will make up
the amount, and if not, they must reimburse the difference.It will
be seen from this that we have tried to comply with the wishes of
His late Excellency van Mydregt, who wrote from Negapatam on July 10,
1687, that the new fortifications there were to be supplied with lime
and all other building materials which are to be found here.The lime
sent there since that date has amounted to 4,751 31/75 lasts.[27]

The dye-root is a product found in this territory which yields the
Company a considerable profit.The best kinds are found in Carrediva,
but the largest quantity in Manaar.The other kinds, found in the
Wanni and The Islands, are so inferior that they cannot be used for
dyeing unless they are mixed with the kinds obtained from Manaar
and Carrediva, and are found in small quantities only.The inferior
kinds are used in this way so that they may not be lost, because it
is to be feared that there will be a greater scarcity of root than
of cloth.I will not enter into detail here as to how, by whom,
where, and when these roots are dug out, or how they are employed
in the dyeing of cloth, or again how much is received yearly; as
all these matters have been mentioned at length on other occasions,
making it unnecessary to do so here.I therefore refer Your Honours
to an account by the late Commandeur Blom, dated April 25, 1693,
with regard to the cultivation and digging of this root, and another
by the same Commandeur of November 12 of the same year with regard to
the dyeing of red cloth and the use of dye-root, while Your Honours
might also look up the document sent to Colombo on December 29, 1694,
by Your Honours and myself, and another of September 16, 1695, where
an estimate is made of the quantity of cloth that could be dyed here
yearly with the root found in this Commandement.An answer will also
be found there to the question raised by the Honourable the Supreme
Government of India in their letter to Ceylon of December 12, 1695,
as to whether the dye-roots found in Java costing Rds.5 the picol
[38] of 125 lb.and sent here might be employed with profit in the
service of the Company, and whether these roots from Java could not
with advantage be planted here.The reply from Colombo of January
6, 1696, in answer to our letter of September 16, 1695, must also
be considered, in order that Your Honours may bear in mind all the
arguments that have been urged on this subject.Experiments have been
made with the Java roots to see whether they could be turned to any
account, and with a view to compare them with the Jaffna roots.It
seems to me that good results may be obtained from the Brancoedoe
roots, according to the experiments made by myself and afterwards by a
Committee in compliance with the orders of Their Excellencies, but as
we cannot be quite sure yet another quantity of Java roots for further
experiments has been sent, as stated in the letter from Batavia of July
3, 1696.Your Honours must pay great attention to these experiments,
so that the result may be definitely known.This was prevented so
far by the rainy season.Besides the above-mentioned documents,
Your Honours will also find useful information on the subject in two
reports submitted by a Committee bearing date July 29 and December
10, 1695.Experiments must also be made to find out whether the
Wancoedoe roots used either alone or mixed with the Jaffna roots will
yield a good red dye of fast colour, this being the wish of Their
Excellencies.Meantime the red cloth ordered in 1694, being 142 webs,
and the 60 webs ordered lately, must be sent as soon as the required
linen arrives from Coromandel.This cloth must be carefully dyed, and
after being examined and approved by the members of Council must be
properly packed by the Pennisten of the Comptoiren who are employed
in this work, on both which points complaints have been received,
and which must be guarded against in future.During my residence
96 webs of cloth have been sent out of the 142 that were ordered,
so that 46 are yet to be sent, besides the 60 of the new order.No
more cloth and dye-roots must be issued to the dyers at a time than
they can use in one dyeing, because otherwise the cloth lies about in
their poor dwellings and gets damaged, while the roots are stolen or
used for private purposes, which is a loss to the Company, of which
many instances might be quoted.There is no doubt the Administrateur
Abraham Mighielsz Biermans, who has been entrusted with the supervision
of this work for many years, will endeavour to further the interests
of the Company in this respect as much as possible and keep these lazy
people to their work.For the present there is a sufficient quantity
of material in stock, as there were in the storehouses on the last
of November, 1696, 60,106 lb.of different kinds of dye-root, with
which a large quantity of cloth may be dyed, while a yearly supply is
delivered at the Fort from Manaar, Carrediva, &c. In Carrediva and "the
Seven Places" as they are called, much less is delivered than formerly,
because at present roots are dug up after the fields have been sown,
while formerly this used to be done before the lands were cultivated,
to the disadvantage of the owners.This practice was abandoned during
the time of Commandeur Blom, as it was considered unfair; because the
fields are already heavily taxed, and on this account the delivery
is 20 to 25 bharen [39] less than before.[28]

The farming out of the various duties in this Commandement may
be considered as the third source of revenue to the Company in
Jaffnapatam, and next to that of the sale of elephants and the revenue
derived from the poll tax, land rents, tithes, Adigary, and Officie
Gelden mentioned before.The farming out of the said duties on the last
of February, 1696, brought to the Company the sum of Rds.27,518 for
the period of one and a half year.The leases were extended on this
occasion with a view to bring them to a close with the close of the
Trade Accounts, which, in compliance with the latest instructions from
Batavia, must be balanced on August 31.The previous year, from March
1 to February 28, 1695-1696, the lease of the said duties amounted
to Rds.15,641, which for 18 months would have been Rds.23,461 1/2,
so that the Company received this year Rds.4,056 1/2 more than last
time; but I believe that the new duty on the import of foreign cloth
has largely contributed to this difference.This was proposed by me
on January 22, 1695, and approved by the Hon.the Supreme Government
of India in their letter of December 12 of the same year.7,100, including the stamping of native cloth with
a seal at 25 per cent., while for the foreign cloth no more than 20
per cent.As Their Excellencies considered this difference
unfair, it has pleased them, at the earnest request of the natives,
or rather at the request of the Majoraals on behalf of the natives, in
a later letter of July 3, 1696, to consent to the native cloth being
taxed at 20 per cent.only, which must be considered in connection
with the new lease.Meantime the order from Batavia contained in
the Resolutions of the Council of India of October 4, 1694, must be
observed, where all farmers are required to pay the monthly terms
of their lease at the beginning of each month in advance.This rule
has been followed here, and it is expressly stipulated in the rent
conditions.Whether the farming out of the duty on native and foreign
cloth will amount to as much or more I cannot say; because I fear
that the present farmer has not made much profit by it, in consequence
of the export having decreased on account of the closing of the free
passage to Trincomalee and Batticaloa.The sale of these cloths depends
largely on the import of nely from the said places, and this having
been prevented the sale necessarily decreased and consequently the
farmer made less profit.The passage having been re-opened, however,
it may be expected that the sale will increase again.With a view
to ascertain the exact value of this lease, I sent orders to all
the Passes on February 27, 1696, that a monthly list should be kept
of how many stamped cloths are passed through and by whom, so that
Your Honours will be able to see next August how much cloth has been
exported by examining these lists, while you may also make an estimate
of the quantity of cloth sold here without crossing the Passes, as
the farmer obtains his duty on these.Your Honours may further read
what was reported on this subject from here to Colombo on December 16,
1696, and the reply from Colombo of January 6 of this year.[29]

The Trade Accounts are closed now on August 31, as ordered by the
Supreme Government of India in their letter of May 3, 1695.Last
year's account shows that in this Commandement the Company made a
clear profit of Fl.It might have been greater if more
elephants could have been obtained from the Wanni and Ponneryn, or if
we were allowed the profits on the elephants from Galle and Colombo
sold here on behalf of the Company, which are not accompanied by an
invoice, but only by a simple acknowledgment.Another reason that it
was not higher is that we had to purchase the very expensive grain
from Coromandel.Your Honours must also see that besides observing
this rule of closing the accounts in August, they are submitted to
the Council for examination, in order that it may be seen whether the
discharges are lawful and whether other matters are in agreement with
the instructions, and also whether some items could not be reduced
in future, in compliance with the order passed by Resolution in the
Council of India on September 6, 1694.These and all other orders
sent here during the last two years must be strictly observed, such
as the sending to Batavia of the old muskets, the river navigation
of ships and sloops, the reduction of native weights and measures to
Dutch pounds, the carrying over of the old credits and debits into
the new accounts, the making and use of casks of a given measure,
and the accounting for the new casks of meat, bacon, butter, and
all such orders, which cannot be all mentioned here, but which Your
Honours must look up now and again so as not to forget any and thus
be involved in difficulties.[(30)]

The debts due to the Company at the closing of the accounts must be
entered in a separate memorandum, and submitted with the accounts.In
this memorandum the amount of the debt must be stated, with the name
of the debtor, and whether there is a prospect of the amount being
recovered or not.As shown by Their Excellencies, these outstandings
amounted at the closing of the accounts at the end of February, 1694,
to the sum of Fl.This was reduced on my last departure
to Colombo to Fl.31,948.9.15, as may be seen in the memorandum by the
Administrateur of January 31, 1696.I will now proceed to show that on
my present departure no more is due than the amount of Fl.16,137.8,
in which, however, the rent of the farmers is not included, as it is
only provisional and will be paid up each month, viz.:--


                                                    Fl.The Province of Timmoraten                 376.2.8 [40]
        The Province of Pathelepally               579.10.0
        Panduamoety and Nagachitty               2,448.13.0
        Company's weavers                          167.15.0
        Manuel van Anecotta, Master Dyer         9,823.6.0
        The Caste of the Tannecares              1,650.0.0
        The dyers at Point Pedro and Nalloer       566.14.0
        Don Philip Nellamapane                     375.0.0
        Ambelawanner Wannia                        150.0.0
                                                ===========
                                      Total     16,137.0.8


With regard to the debt of the weavers, amounting to Fl.2,616.8,
I deem it necessary here to mention that the arrears in Timmoratsche
and Patchelepally, spoken of in the memorandum by the Administrateur
of January 31, 1696, compiled by Mr.Bierman on my orders of November
30, 1695, after the closing of the accounts at the end of August,
of which those of Tandia Moety and Naga Chitty and that of the
Company's weavers which refer to the same persons, may, in my opinion,
be considered as irrecoverable.It would therefore be best if Their
Excellencies at Batavia would exempt them from the payment.This debt
dates from the time when it was the intention to induce some weavers
from the opposite coast to come here for the weaving of cloth for the
Company.This caste, called Sinias, [41] received the said amount in
cash, thread, and cotton in advance, and thus were involved in this
large debt, which having been reduced to the amount stated above, has
remained for some years exactly the same, in spite of all endeavours
made to collect it, and notwithstanding that the Paybook-keeper was
appointed to see that the materials were not stolen and the money not
wasted.It has been, however, all in vain, because these people were
so poor that they could not help stealing if they were to live, and it
seems impossible to recover the amount, which was due at first from
200 men, out of whom only 15 or 16 are left now.When they do happen
occasionally to deliver a few gingams, these are so inferior that
the soldiers who receive them at the price of good materials complain
a great deal.I think it unfair that the military should be made to
pay in this way, as the gingams are charged by the Sinias at Fl.6
or 6.10 a piece, while the soldiers have to accept the same at Fl.The same is the case with the Moeris and other cloths which
are delivered by the Sinias, or rather which are obtained from them
with much difficulty; and I have no doubt Your Honours will receive
instructions from Batavia with regard to this matter.Meanwhile they
must be dealt with in the ordinary way; but in case they are exempted
from the payment of their debt I think they ought to be sent out of
the country, not only because they are not liable to taxes or services
to the Company, but also because of the idolatry and devil-worship
which they have to a certain extent been allowed to practise, and
which acts as a poison to the other inhabitants, among whom we have
so long tried to introduce the Dutch Reformed religion.The debt of the dyers at Annecatte, entered under the name of Manoel of
Annecatte, dyer, which amounted at the end of August to Fl.9,823.6,
has been since reduced by Fl.707.10, and is still being reduced
daily, as there is sufficient work at present to keep them all busy,
of which mention has been made under the heading of Dye-roots.This
debt amounted at the end of February, 1694, to Fl.11,920.13.6, so
that since that time one-third has been recovered.This is done by
retaining half the pay for dyeing; for when they deliver red cloth
they only receive half of their pay, and there is thus a prospect
of the whole of this debt being recovered.Care must be taken that
no one gives them any money on interest, which has been prohibited,
because it was found that selfish people, aware of the poverty of
these dyers, sometimes gave them money, not only on interest but at
a usurious rate, so that they lost also half of the pay they received
from the Company on account of those debts, and were kept in continual
poverty, which made them either despondent or too lazy to work.For
this reason an order was issued during the time of the late Commandeur
Blom that such usurers would lose all they had lent to these dyers,
as the Company would not interfere on behalf of the creditors as long
as the debt to the Company was still due.On this account also their
lands have been mortgaged to the Company, and Mr.Blom proposed in
his questions of December 22, 1693, that these should be sold.But
this will not be necessary now, and it would not be advantageous to
the Company if the weavers were thus ruined, while on the other hand
this debt may on the whole be recovered.(31)

The Tannekares are people who made a contract with the Company during
the time of Mr.Blom by a deed bearing date June 7, 1691, in terms
of which they were to deliver two elephants without teeth in lieu
of their poll tax amounting to Fl.269.4.17/60 and for their Oely
service.It was found, however, last August that they were in arrears
for 11 animals, which, calculated at Rds.150 each, brings
their debts to Fl.As all contracts of this
kind for the delivery of elephants are prejudicial to the Company,
I proposed on January 22, 1695, that this contract should be annulled,
stating our reasons for doing so.This proposal was submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia in our letter of August 12 of the same year,
and was approved by them by their letter of December 12, 1695, so that
these people are again in the same position as the other inhabitants,
and will be taxed by the Thombo-keeper for poll tax, land rent, and
Oely service from September 1, 1696.These they must be made to pay,
and they also must be made to pay up the arrears, which they are quite
capable of doing, which matter must be recommended to the attention
of the tax collector in Waddamoraatsche.The debt due by the dyers of Nalloer and Point Pedro, which arose
from their receiving half their pay in advance at their request,
as they were not able to pay their poll tax and land rent (which
amounted to Fl.566.14), has been paid up since.The debt of Don Philip Nellamapane, which amounts to Fl.375, arose
from the amount being lent to him for the purchase of nely in the
latter part of 1694, because there was a complaint that the Wannias,
through a failure of the crop, did not have a sufficient quantity
of grain for the maintenance of the hunters.This money was handed
to Don Gaspar Ilengenarene Mudaliyar, brother-in-law of Don Philip,
and at the request of the latter; so that really, not he, but Don
Gaspar, owes the money.He must be urged to pay up this amount,
which it would be less difficult to do if they were not so much in
arrears with their tribute, because in that case the first animals
they delivered could be taken in payment.There is no doubt, however,
that this debt will be paid if they are urged.The same is the case with the sum of Fl.150 which Ambelewanne Wannia
owes, but as he has to deliver only a few elephants this small amount
can be settled the first time he delivers any elephants above his
tribute.(32)

The Pay Accounts must, like the Trade Accounts, be closed on the
last day of August every year, in compliance with the orders of the
Honourable the Supreme Government of India contained in their letter
of August 13, 1695.They must also be audited and examined, according
to the Resolution passed in the Council of India on September 6,
1694, so that it may be seen whether all the items entered in the
Trade Accounts for payments appear also in the Pay Accounts, while
care must be taken that those who are in arrears at the close of the
books on account of advance received do not receive such payments too
liberally, against which Your Honours will have to guard, so that no
difficulties may arise and the displeasure of Their Excellencies may
not be incurred.Care must also be taken that the various instructions
for the Paybook-keeper are observed, such as those passed by Resolution
of Their Excellencies on August 27 and June 29, 1694, with regard to
the appraising, selling, and entering in the accounts of estates left
by the Company's servants, the rules for the Curators ad lites, those
with regard to the seizure of salaries by private debtors passed by
Resolution of August 5, 1696, in the Council of India, and the rules
passed by Resolution of March 20, with regard to such sums belonging
to the Company's servants as may be found outstanding on interest
after their death, namely, that these must four or six weeks after
be transferred from the Trade Accounts into the Pay Accounts to the
credit of the deceased.(33)

The matter of the Secretariate not being conducted as it ought to
be, cannot be dealt with in full here.It was said in the letters
of November 17 and December 12, 1696, that the new Secretary,
Mr.Bout (who was sent here without any previous intimation to the
Commandeur), would see that all documents were properly registered,
bound, and preserved, but these are the least important duties
of a good Secretary.I cannot omit to recommend here especially
that a journal should be kept, in which all details are entered,
because there are many occurrences with regard to the inhabitants,
the country, the trade, elephants, &c., which it will be impossible to
find when necessary unless they appear in the letters sent to Colombo,
which, however, do not always deal very circumstancially with these
matters.It will be best therefore to keep an accurate journal,
which I found has been neglected for the last three years, surely
much against the intention of the Company.The Secretary must also
see that the Scholarchial resolutions and the notes made on them by
the Political Council are copied and preserved at the Secretariate,
another duty which has not been done for some years.I know on the
other hand that a great deal of the time of the Secretary is taken up
with the keeping of the Treasury Accounts, while there is no Chief
Clerk here to assist him with the Treasury Accounts, or to assist
the Commandeur.Blom, and he proposed
in his letters of February 12 and March 29, 1693, to Colombo that
the Treasury Accounts should be kept by the Paybook-keeper, which,
in my humble opinion, would be the best course, as none of the four
Onderkooplieden [42] here could be better employed for this work
than the Paybook-keeper.It must be remembered, however, that Their
Excellencies do not wish the Regulation of December 29, 1692, to be
altered or transgressed, so that these must be still observed.I would
propose a means by which the duties of the Cashier, and consequently of
the Secretary, could be much decreased, considering that the Cashier
can get no other knowledge of the condition of the general revenue
than from the Thombo-keeper who makes up the accounts, namely, that
the Thombo-keeper should act as General Accountant, as well of the
rent for leases as of the poll tax, land rent, tithes, &c., in which
case the native collectors could give their accounts to him.This,
I expect, would simplify matters, and enable the Secretary to be of
more assistance to the Commandeur.In case such arrangement should be
made, the General Accountant could keep the accounts of the revenue
specified above, which could afterwards be transferred to the accounts
of the Treasury; but Your Honours must wait for the authority to do
so, as I do not wish to take this responsibility.I must recommend
to Your Honours here to see that in future no petitions with regard
to fines are written for the inhabitants except by the Secretaries
of the Political Council or the Court of Justice, as those officers
in India act as Notaries.This has to be done because the petitions
from these rebellious people of Jaffnapatam are so numerous that the
late Mr.Blom had to forbid some of them writing such communications,
because even Toepasses and Mestices take upon themselves to indite
such letters, which pass under the name of petitions, but are often so
full of impertinent and seditious expressions that they more resemble
libels than petitions.Since neither superior nor inferior persons
are spared in these documents, it is often impossible to discover the
author.Whenever the inhabitants have any complaint to make, I think
it will be sufficient if they ask either of the two Secretaries to
draw out a petition for them in which their grievances are stated,
which may be sent to Colombo if the case cannot be decided here.In
this way it will be possible to see that the petitions are written
on stamped paper as ordered by the Company, while they will be
written with the moderation and discrimination that is necessary in
petitions.There are also brought to the Secretariate every year all
sorts of native protocols, such as those kept by the schoolmasters
at the respective churches, deeds, contracts, ola deeds of sale,
and other instruments as may have been circulated among the natives,
which it is not possible to attend to at the Dutch Secretariate.But
as I have been informed that the schoolmasters do not always observe
the Company's orders, and often issue fraudulent instruments and thus
deceive their own countrymen, combining with the Majoraals and the
Chiefs of the Aldeas, by whom a great deal of fraud is committed,
it will be necessary for the Dessave to hold an inquiry and punish
the offenders or deliver them up for punishment.For this purpose
he must read and summarize the instructions with regard to this and
other matters issued successively by Their Excellencies the Governors
of Ceylon and the subaltern Commandeurs of this Commandement, to be
found in the placaats and notices published here relating to this
Commandement.The most important of these rules must be published in
the different churches from time to time, as the people of Jaffnapatam
are much inclined to all kinds of evil practices, which has been
the reason that so many orders and regulations had to be issued by
the placaats, all which laws are the consequence of transgressions
committed.Yet it is very difficult to make these people observe
the rules so long as they find but the least encouragement given to
them by the higher authorities, as stated already.It was decided in
the Meeting of Council of October 20, 1696, that a large number of
old and useless olas which were kept at the Secretariate and were
a great encumbrance should be sorted, and the useless olas burnt
in the presence of a committee, while the Mallabaar and Portuguese
documents concerning the Thombo or description of lands were to be
placed in the custody of the Thombo-keeper.This may be seen in the
report of November 8 of the same year.In this way the Secretariate
has been cleared, and the documents concerning the Thombo put in their
proper place, where they must be kept in future; so that the different
departments may be kept separately with a view to avoid confusion.I
have also noticed on various occasions that the passports of vessels
are lost, either at the Secretariate or elsewhere.Therefore, even so
lately as last December, instructions were sent to Kayts and Point
Pedro to send all such passports here as soon as possible.These
passports, on the departure of the owners, were to be kept at the
Secretariate after renovation by endorsement, unless they were more
than six months old, in which case a new passport was to be issued.In
case Your Honours are not sufficiently acquainted with the form of
these passports and how they are to be signed as introduced by His
late Excellency Governor van Mydregt, you will find the necessary
information in the letters from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of 1687 and
1688 and another from Colombo to Jaffnapatam bearing date April 11,
1690, in which it is stated to what class of persons passports may
be issued.The same rules must be observed in Manaar so far as this
district is concerned, in compliance with the orders contained in
the letter of November 13, 1696.(34)

The Court of Justice has of late lost much of its prestige among the
inhabitants, because, seeing that the Bellale Mudaly Tamby, to whom
previous reference has been made, succeeded on a simple petition sent
to Colombo to escape the Court of Justice while his case was still
undecided (as may be seen from a letter from Colombo of January 6,
1696, and the reply thereto of the 26th of this month), they have an
idea that they cannot be punished here.Even people of the lowest caste
threaten that they will follow the same course whenever they think
they will not gain their object here, especially since they have seen
with what honours Mudaly Tamby was sent back and how the Commissioners
did all he desired, although his own affairs were not even sufficiently
settled yet.A great deal may be stated and proved on this subject, but
as this is not the place to do so, I will only recommend Your Honours
to uphold the Court of Justice in its dignity as much as possible,
and according to the rules and regulations laid down with regard to
it in the Statutes of Batavia and other Instructions.The principal
rule must be that every person receives speedy and prompt justice,
which for various reasons could not be done in the case of Mudaly
Tamby, and the opportunity was given for his being summoned to Colombo.At present the Court of Justice consists of the following persons:--


The Commandeur, President (absent).Dessave de Bitter, Vice-President.van der Bruggen, Administrateur.The Thombo-keeper, Pieter Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos.The Onderkoopman Jan van Groeneveld.But it must be considered that on my departure to Mallabaar, and in
case the Dessave be commissioned to the pearl fishery, this College
will be without a President; the Onderkooplieden Bolscho and Roos
may also be away in the interior for the renovation of the Head
Thombo, and it may also happen that Lieut.Claas Isaacsz will be
appointed Lieutenant-Dessave, in which case he also would have to go
to the interior; in such case there would be only three members left
besides the complainant ex-officio and the Secretary, who would have
no power to pronounce sentence.The Lieutenant van Hovingen and the
Secretary of the Political Council could be appointed for the time,
but in that case the Court would be more a Court Martial than a Court
of Justice, consisting of three Military men and two Civil Servants,
while there would be neither a President nor a Vice-President.I
consider it best, therefore, that the sittings of the Court should
be suspended until the return of the Dessave from the pearl fishery,
unless His Excellency the Governor and the Council should give other
instructions, which Your Honours would be bound to obey.I also found that no law books are kept at the Court, and it would
be well, therefore, if Your Honours applied to His Excellency the
Governor and the Council to provide you with such books as they deem
most useful, because only a minority of the members possess these
books privately, and, as a rule, the Company's servants are poor
lawyers.Justice may therefore be either too severely or too leniently
administered.There are also many native customs according to which
civil matters have to be settled, as the inhabitants would consider
themselves wronged if the European laws be applied to them, and it
would be the cause of disturbances in the country.As, however, a
knowledge of these matters cannot be obtained without careful study and
experience, which not every one will take the trouble to acquire, it
would be well if a concise digest be compiled according to information
supplied by the chiefs and most impartial natives.No one could have a
better opportunity to do this than the Dessave, and such a work might
serve for the instruction of the members of the Court of Justice as
well as for new rulers arriving here, for no one is born with this
knowledge.I am surprised that no one has as yet undertaken this work.Laurens Pyl in his Memoir of November 7, 1679,
with regard to the Court of Justice, namely, that the greatest
precautions must be used in dealing with this false, cunning, and
deceitful race, who think little of taking a false oath when they see
any advantage for themselves in doing so, must be followed.This is
perhaps the reason that the Mudaliyars Don Philip Willewaderayen and
Don Anthony Naryna were ordered in a letter from Colombo of March 22,
1696, to take their oath at the request of the said Mudaly Tamby
only in the heathen fashion, although this seemed out of keeping
with the principles of the Christian religion (Salva Reverentio),
as these people are recognized as baptized Christians, and therefore
the taking of this oath is not practised here.The natives are also
known to be very malicious and contentious among themselves, and do
not hesitate to bring false charges against each other, sometimes for
the sole purpose of being able to say that they gained a triumph over
their opponents before the Court of Justice.They are so obstinate
in their pretended rights that they will revive cases which had been
decided during the time of the Portuguese, and insist on these being
dealt with again.I have been informed that some rules have been laid
down with regard to such cases by other Commandeurs some 6, 8, 10,
and 20 years previous, which it would be well to look up with a view
to restrain these people.They also always revive cases decided by
the Commandeurs or Dessaves whenever these are succeeded by others,
and for this reason I never consented to alter any decision by a former
Commandeur, as the party not satisfied can always appeal to the higher
court at Colombo.His Excellency the Governor and the Council desired
very properly in their letter of November 15, 1694, that no processes
decided civilly by a Commandeur as regent should be brought in appeal
before the Court of Justice here, because the same Commandeur acts in
that College as President.Such cases must therefore be referred to
Colombo, which is the proper course.Care must also be taken that all
documents concerning each case are preserved, registered, and submitted
by the Secretary.I say this because I found that this was shamefully
neglected during my residence here in the years 1691 and 1692, when
several cases had been decided and sentences pronounced, of which not
a single document was preserved, still less the notes or copies made.Another matter to be observed is that contained in the Resolutions
of the Council of India of June 14, 1694, where the amounts paid to
the soldiers and sailors are ordered not to exceed the balance due
to them above what is paid for them monthly in the Fatherland.I
also noticed that at present 6 Lascoreens and 7 Caffirs are paid
as being employed by the Fiscaal, while formerly during the time
of the late Fiscaal Joan de Ridder, who was of the rank of Koopman,
not more than 5 Lascoreens and 6 Caffirs were ever paid for.I do not
know why the number has been increased, and this greater expense is
imposed upon the Company.No more than the former number are to be
employed in future.This number has sufficed for so many years under
the former Fiscaal, and as the Fiscaal has no authority to arrest any
natives without the knowledge of the Commandeur or the Dessave, it
will still suffice.It was during the time of the late Onderkoopman
Lengele, when the word "independent" carried much weight, that the
staff of native servants was increased, although for the service of
the whole College of the Political Council not more than 4 Lascoreens
are employed, although its duties are far more numerous than those of
the Fiscaal.I consider that the number of native servants should be
limited to that strictly necessary, so that it may not be said that
they are kept for show or for private purposes.[35]

The Company has endeavoured at great expense, from the time it took
possession of this Island, to introduce the religion of the True
Reformed Christian Church among this perverse nation.For this purpose
there have been maintained during the last 38 years 35 churches and
3 or 4 clergymen, but how far this has been accepted by the people
of Jaffnapatam I will leave for my successors to judge, rather than
express my opinion on the subject here.It is a well-known fact that
in the year 1693 nearly all the churches in this part of the country
were found stocked with heathen books, besides the catechisms and
Christian prayer books.It is remarkable that this should have
occurred after His late Excellency Governor van Mydregt in 1689
had caused all Roman Catholic churches and secret convents to be
dismantled and abolished, and instead of them founded a Seminary or
Training School for the propagation of the true religion, incurring
great expenses for this purpose.I heard only lately that, while I
was in Colombo and the Dessave in Negapatam, a certain Lascoreen,
with the knowledge of the schoolmasters of the church in Warrany, had
been teaching the children the most wicked fables one could think of,
and that these schoolmasters had been summoned before the Court of
Justice here and caned and the books burnt.But on my return I found
to my surprise that these schoolmasters had not been dismissed, and
that neither at the Political Council nor at the Court of Justice
had any notes been made of this occurrence, and still less a record
made as to how the case had been decided.The masters were therefore
on my orders summoned again before the meeting of the Scholarchen,
by which they were suspended until such time as the Lascoreen should
be arrested.I have not succeeded in laying hands on this Lascoreen,
but Your Honours must make every endeavour, after my departure, to
trace him out; because he may perhaps imagine that the matter has
been forgotten.Such occurrences as these are not new in Warrany;
because the idolatry committed there in 1679 will be known to some
of you.On that occasion the authors were arrested by the Company
through the assistance of the Brahmin Timmersa Nayk, notwithstanding he
himself was a heathen, as may be seen from the public acknowledgment
granted to him by His Excellency Laurens Pyl, November 7, 1679.I
therefore think that the Wannias are at the bottom of all this
idolatry, not only because they have alliances with the Bellales all
over the country, but especially because their adherents are to be
found in Warrany and also in the whole Province of Patchelepalle,
where half the inhabitants are dependent on them.This was seen at
the time the Wannias marched about here in Jaffnapatam in triumph,
and almost posed as rulers here.We may be assured that they are
the greatest devil-worshippers that could be found, for they have
never yet admitted a European into their houses, for fear of their
idolatry being discovered, while for the sake of appearance they
allow themselves to be married and baptized by our ministers.For instance, it is a well-known fact that Don Philip Nellamapane
applied to His late Excellency van Mydregt that one of his sons might
be admitted into the Seminary, with a view of getting into his good
graces; while no sooner had His Excellency left this than the son
was recalled under some false pretext.In 1696, when this boy was in
Negapatam with the Dessave de Bitter, he was caught making offerings
in the temples, wearing disguise at the time.It could not be expected
that such a boy, of no more than ten or twelve years old, should do
this if he had not been taught or ordered by his parents to do so
or had seen them doing the same, especially as he was being taught
another religion in the Seminary.I could relate many such instances,
but as this is not the place to do so, this may serve as an example
to put you on your guard.It is only known to God, who searches the
hearts and minds of men, what the reason is that our religion is not
more readily accepted by this nation: whether it is because the time
for their conversion has not yet arrived, or whether for any other
reason, I will leave to the Omniscient Lord.You might read what has
been written by His Excellency van Mydregt in his proposal to the
reverend brethren the clergy and the Consistory here on January 11,
1690, with regard to the promotion of religion and the building of
a Seminary.I could refer to many other documents bearing on this
subject, but I will only quote here the lessons contained in the
Instructions of the late Commandeur Paviljoen of December 19, 1665,
where he urges that the reverend brethren the clergy must be upheld and
supported by the Political Council in the performance of their august
duties, and that they must be provided with all necessary comforts;
so that they may not lose their zeal, but may carry out their work
with pleasure and diligence.On the other hand care must be taken
that no infringement of the jurisdiction of the Political Council
takes place, and on this subject it would be well for Your Honours
to read the last letter from Batavia of July 3,1696, with regard to
the words Sjuttan Peria Padrie and other such matters concerning the
Political Council as well as the clergy.(36)

With regard to the Seminary or training school for native children
founded in the year 1690 by His late Excellency van Mydregt, as another
evidence of the anxiety of the Company to propagate the True and Holy
Gospel among this blind nation for the salvation of their souls,
I will state here chiefly that Your Honours may follow the rules
and regulations compiled by His Excellency, as also those sent to
Jaffnapatam on the 16th of the same month.Twice a year the pupils
must be examined in the presence of the Scholarchen (those of the
Seminary as well as of the other churches) and of the clergy and the
rector.In this college the Commandeur is to act as President, but, as
I am to depart to Mallabaar, this office must be filled by the Dessave,
in compliance with the orders contained in the letters from Colombo
of April 4, 1696.The reports of these examinations must be entered
in the minute book kept by the Scriba, Jan de Crouse.These minutes
must be signed by the President and the other curators, while Your
Honours will be able to give further instructions and directions as
to how they are to be kept.During my absence the examination must be
held in the presence of the Dessave, and the Administrateur Michiels
Biermans and the Thombo-keeper Pieter Bolscho as Scholarchen of the
Seminary, the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and the Onderkoopman Joan Roos
as Scholarchen of the native churches, the reverend Adrianus Henricus
de Mey, acting Rector, and three other clergymen.It must be remembered, however, that this is only with regard to
examinations and not with regard to the framing of resolutions, which
so far has been left to the two Scholarchen and the President of the
Seminary.These, as special curators and directors, have received
higher authority from His Excellency the Governor and the Council,
with the understanding, however, that they observe the rules given
by His Excellency and the Council both with regard to the rector and
the children, in their letters of April 4 and June 13, 1696, and the
Resolutions framed by the curators of June 27 and October 21, 1695,
which were approved in Colombo.Whereas the school had been so far
maintained out of a fund set apart for this purpose, in compliance
with the orders of His Excellency, special accounts being kept of
the expenditure, it has now pleased the Council of India to decide
by Resolution of October 4, 1694, that only the cost of erection
of this magnificent building, which amounted to Rds.5,274, should
be paid out of the said fund.This debt having been paid, orders
were received in a letter from Their Excellencies of June 3, 1696,
that the institution is to be maintained out of the Company's funds,
special accounts of the expenditure being kept and sent yearly, both
to the Fatherland and to Batavia.At the closing of the accounts
last August the accounts of the Seminary as well as the amount due
to it were transferred to the Company's accounts.17,141, made up as follows:--


    Rds.10,341 entered at the Chief Counting-house in Colombo.1,200 cash paid by the Treasurer of the Seminary into the
                Company's Treasury, December 1, 1696.The latter was on December 1, 1690, on the foundation of the Seminary,
granted to that institution, and must now again, as before, be
placed by the Cashier on interest and a special account kept thereof;
because out of this fund the repairs to the churches and schools and
the expenses incurred in the visits of the clergy and the Scholarchen
have to be paid.Other items of revenue which had been appropriated
for the foundation of the Seminary, such as the farming out of
the fishery, &c., must be entered again in the Company's accounts,
as well as the revenue derived from the sale of lands, and that of
the two elephants allowed yearly to the Seminary.The fines levied
occasionally by the Dessave on the natives for offences committed
must be entered in the accounts of the Deaconate or of that of the
church fines, for whichever purpose they are most required.The Sicos [43] money must again be expended in the fortifications,
as it used to be done before the building of the Training School.The
income of the Seminary consisted of these six items, besides the
interest paid on the capital.This, I think, is all I need say on
the subject for Your Honours' information.I will only add that I
hope and pray that the Lord may more and more bless this Christian
design and the religious zeal of the Company.(37)

The Scholarchen Commission is a college of civil and ecclesiastical
officers, which for good reasons was introduced into this part of
the country from the very beginning of our rule.Their meetings are
usually held on the first Tuesday of every month, and at these is
decided what is necessary to be done for the advantage of the church,
such as the discharge and appointment of schoolmasters and merinhos,
[44] &c. It is here also that the periodical visits of the brethren of
the clergy to the different parishes are arranged.The applications of
natives who wish to enter into matrimony are also addressed to this
college.All the decisions are entered monthly in the resolutions,
which are submitted to the Political Council.This is done as I had
an idea that things were not as they ought to be with regard to the
visitation of churches and inspection of schools, and that the rules
made to that effect had come to be disregarded.This was a bad example,
and it may be seen from the Scholarchial Resolution Book of 1695 and
of the beginning of 1696, what difficulty I had in reintroducing these
rules.I succeeded at last so far in this matter that the visits of
the brethren of the clergy were properly divided and the time for them
appointed.This may be seen from the replies of the Political Council
to the Scholarchial Resolutions of January 14 and February 2, 1696.On my return from Ceylon I found inserted in the Scholarchial
Resolution Book a petition from two of the clergymen which had been
clandestinely sent to Colombo, in which they did not hesitate to
complain of the orders issued with regard to the visits referred to,
and, although these orders had been approved by His Excellency the
Governor and the Council, as stated above, the request made in this
clandestine petition was granted on March 6, 1696, and the petition
returned to Jaffnapatam with a letter signed on behalf of the Company
on March 14 following.It is true I also found an order from Colombo,
bearing date April 4 following, to the effect that no petitions should
be sent in future except through the Government here, which is in
accordance with the rules observed all over India, but the letter
from Colombo of November 17, received here, and the letter sent from
here to Colombo on December 12, prove that the rule was disregarded
almost as soon as it was made.On this account I could not reply
to the resolutions of the Scholarchen, as the petition, contrary to
those rules, was inserted among them.I think that the respect due
to a ruler in the service of the Company should not be sacrificed to
the private opposition of persons who consider that the orders issued
are to their disadvantage, and who rely on the success of private
petitions sent clandestinely which are publicly granted.In order not
to expose myself to such an indignity for the second time I left the
resolutions unanswered, and it will be necessary for Your Honours to
call a meeting of the Political Council to consider these resolutions,
to prevent the work among the natives being neglected.The College
of the Scholarchen consists at present of the following persons:--


The Dessave de Bitter, President.The Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, Scholarch.The Onderkoopman P. Chr.The Onderkoopman Joan Roos, Scholarch.Adrianus Henricus de Mey, Clergyman.Philippus de Vriest, Clergyman.Thomas van Symey, Clergyman.I am obliged to mention here also for Your Honours' information that I
have noticed that the brethren of the clergy, after having succeeded
by means of their petition to get the visits arranged according to
their wish, usually apply for assistance, such as attendants, coolies,
cayoppen, &c., as soon as the time for their visits arrive, that is to
say, when it is their turn to go to such places as have the reputation
of furnishing good mutton, fowls, butter, &c.; but when they have to
visit the poorer districts, such as Patchelepalle, the boundaries of
the Wanny, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa, they seldom give notice of the
arrival of the time, and some even go to the length of refusing to go
until they are commanded to depart.From this an idea may be formed of
the nature of their love for the work of propagating religion.Some
also take their wives with them on their visits of inspection to
the churches and schools, which is certainly not right as regards
the natives, because they have to bear the expense.With regard to
the regulations concerning the churches and schools, I think these
are so well known to Your Honours that it would be superfluous for
me to quote any documents here.I will therefore only recommend the
strict observation of all these rules, and also of those made by His
Excellency Mr.van Mydregt of November 29, 1690, and those of Mr.Blom
of October 20, with regard to the visits of the clergy to the churches
and the instructions for the Scholarchen in Ceylon generally by His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of December 25, 1663, and
approved by the Council of India with a few alterations in March, 1667.The Consistory consists at present of the four ministers mentioned
above, besides:--


Joan Roos, Elder.To these is added as Commissaris Politicus, the Administrateur Abraham
Michielsz Biermans, in compliance with the orders of December 27, 1643,
issued by His late Excellency the Governor General Antony van Diemen
and the Council of India at Batavia.Further information relating
to the churches may be found in the resolutions of the Political
Council and the College of the Scholarchen of Ceylon from March 13,
1668, to April 3 following.I think that in these documents will be
found all measures calculated to advance the prosperity of the church
in Jaffnapatam, and to these may be added the instructions for the
clergy passed at the meeting of January 11, 1651.(38)

The churches and the buildings attached to the churches are in many
places greatly decayed.I found to my regret that some churches
look more like stables than buildings where the Word of God is to be
propagated among the Mallabaars.It is evident that for some years
very little has been done in regard to this matter, and as this is a
work particularly within the province of the Dessave, I have no doubt
that he will take the necessary measures to remedy the evil; so that
the natives may not be led to think that even their rulers do not have
much esteem for the True Religion.It would be well for the Dessave
to go on circuit and himself inspect all the churches.Until he can
do so he may be guided by the reports with regard to these buildings
made by Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz on March 19 and April 4, 1696.He
must also be aware that the schoolmasters and merinhos have neglected
the gardens attached to the houses, which contain many fruit trees and
formerly yielded very good fruit, especially grapes, which served for
the refreshment of the clergymen and Scholarchen on their visits.(39)

The Civil Court or Land Raad has been instituted on account of the
large population, and because of the difficulty of settling their
disagreements, which cannot always be done by the Commandeur or the
Court of Justice, nor by the Dessave, because his jurisdiction is
limited to the amount of 100 Pordaus.[45] The sessions held every
Wednesday must not be omitted again, as happened during my absence
in Colombo on account of the indisposition of the President.This
Court consists at present of the following persons:--


Abraham Michielsz Biermans, Administrateur.Jan Fransz, Vryburger, Vice-President.Jan Lodewyk Stumphuis, Paymaster.Lucas de Lange, Vryburger.Louis Verwyk, Vryburger.J. L. Stumphuis, mentioned above, Secretary.The native members are Don Louis Poeder and Don Denis Nitsingeraye.The instructions issued for the guidance of the Land Raad may be found
with the documents relating to this college of 1661, in which are also
contained the various Ordinances relating to the official Secretaries
in this Commandement, all which must be strictly observed.As there is
no proper place for the assembly of the Land Raad nor for the meeting
of the Scholarchen, and as both have been held so far in the front room
of the house of the Dessave, where there is no privacy for either,
it will be necessary to make proper provision for this.The best
place would be in the town behind the orphanage, where the Company
has a large plot of land and could acquire still more if a certain
foul pool be filled up as ordered by His Excellency van Mydregt.A
building ought to be put up about 80 or 84 feet by 30 feet, with a
gallery in the centre of about 10 or 12 feet, so that two large rooms
could be obtained, one on either side of the gallery, the one for the
assembly of the Land Raad and the other for that of the Scholarchen.It
would be best to have the whole of the ground raised about 5 or 6
feet to keep it as dry as possible during the rainy season, while
at the entrance, in front of the gallery, a flight of stone steps
would be required.In order, however, that it may not seem as if I am
unaware of the order contained in the letter from Their Excellencies
of November 23, 1695, where the erection of no public building is
permitted without authority from Batavia, except at the private cost
of the builder, I wish to state here particularly that I have merely
stated the above by way of advice, and that Your Honours must wait for
orders from Batavia for the erection of such a building.I imagine
that Their Excellencies will give their consent when they consider
that masonry work costs the Company but very little in Jaffnapatam,
as may be seen in the expenditure on the fortifications, which was
met entirely by the chicos or fines, imposed on those who failed to
attend for the Oely service.Lime, stone, cooly labour, and timber
are obtained free, except palmyra rafters, which, however, are not
expensive.The chief cost consists in the wages for masonry work and
the iron, so that in respect of building Jaffnapatam has an advantage
over other places.Further instructions must however be awaited, as
none of the Company's servants is authorized to dispense with them.(40)

The Weesmeesteren (guardians of the orphans) will find the regulations
for their guidance in the Statutes of Batavia, which were published
on July 1, 1642, [46] by His Excellency the Governor-General Antonis
van Diemen and the Council of India by public placaat.This college
consists at present of the following persons:--


Pieter Chr.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.Johannes Huysman, Boekhouder.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger.the Government of India has been pleased to send
to Ceylon by letter of May 3, 1695, a special Ordinance for the
Orphan Chamber and its officials with regard to their salaries,
I consider it necessary to remind you of it here and to recommend
its strict observance, as well also of the resolution of March 20,
1696, whereby the Orphan Chamber is instructed that all such money
as is placed under their administration which is derived from the
estates of deceased persons who had invested money on interest with
the Company, and whose heirs were not living in the same place, must
be remitted to the Orphan Chamber at Batavia with the interest due
within a month or six weeks.(41)

The Commissioners of Marriage Causes will also find their instructions
in the Statutes of Batavia, mentioned above, which must be carefully
observed.Nothing need be said with regard to this College, but that
it consists of the following persons:--


Claas Isaacsz, Lieutenant, President.Lucas Langer, Vryburger, Vice-President.Joan Roos, Onderkoopman.[42]


The officers of the Burgery, [47] the Pennisten, [48] and the
Ambachtsgezellen [49] will likewise find their instructions and
regulations in the Statutes of Batavia, and apply them as far as
applicable.[43]

The Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and the Wardens of the Town
(Brand and Wyk Meesteren) have their orders and distribution of work
publicly assigned to them by the Regulation of November 8, 1691,
upon which I need not remark anything, except that the following
persons are the present members of this body:--


Jan van Croenevelt, Fiscaal, President.Jan Baptist Verdonk, Vryburger, Vice-President.Lucas de Langer, Vryburger.[44]


The deacons, as caretakers of the poor, have been mentioned already
under the heading of the Consistory.During the last five and half
years they have spent Rds.1,145.3.7 more than they received.As I
apprehended this would cause inconvenience, I proposed in my letter
of December 1, 1696, to Colombo that the Poor House should be endowed
with the Sicos money for the year 1695, which otherwise would have
been granted to the Seminary, which did not need it then, as it had
received more than it required.Meantime orders were received from
Batavia that the funds of the said Seminary should be transferred
to the Company, so that the Sicos money could not be disposed of in
that way.As the deficit is chiefly due to the purchase, alteration,
and repairing of an orphanage and the maintenance of the children,
as may be seen from the letters to Colombo of December 12 and 17,
1696, to which expenditure the Deaconate had not been subject before
the year 1690, other means will have to be considered to increase
its funds in order to prevent the Deaconate from getting into further
arrears.It would be well therefore if Your Honours would carefully
read the Instructions of His late Excellency van Mydregt of November
29, 1690, and ascertain whether alimentation given to the poor by
the Deaconate has been well distributed and whether it really was of
the nature of alms and alimentation as it should be.A report of the
result of your inquiry should be sent to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council of Colombo.You might also state therein whether the
orphanage has not been sufficiently enlarged yet, for it seems to me
that the expenditure is too great for only 14 children, as there are
at present.It might also be considered whether the Company could not
find some source of income for the Deaconate in case this orphanage
is not quite completed without further expenditure, and care must be
taken that the deacons strictly observe the rules laid down for them
in the Regulation of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Ceylon of January 2, 1666.The present matron, Catharina Cornelisz,
widow of the late Krankbezoeker Dupree, must be directed to follow
the rules laid down for her by the Governor here on November 4, 1694,
and approved in Colombo.That all the inferior colleges mentioned
here successively have to be renewed yearly by the Political Council
is such a well-known matter that I do not think it would escape
your attention; but, as approbation from Colombo has to be obtained
for the changes made they have to be considered early, so that the
approbation may be received here in time.The usual date is June 23,
the day of the conquest of this territory, but this date has been
altered again to June 13, 1696, by His Excellency the Governor and
the Council of Colombo.[45]

The assessment of all measures and weights must likewise be renewed
every year, in the presence of the Fiscaal and Commissioners;
because the deceitful nature of these inhabitants is so great that
they seem not to be able to help cheating each other.The proceeds
of this marking, which usually amounts to Rds.70 or 80, are for the
largest part given to some deserving person as a subsistence.On my
arrival here I found that it had been granted to the Vryburger Jurrian
Verwyk, who is an old man and almost unable to serve as an assayer.The
post has, however, been left to him, and his son-in-law Jan Fransz,
also a Vryburger, has been appointed his assistant.The last time
the proceeds amounted to 80 rds.3 fannums, 8 tammekassen and 2 1/2
duyten, as may be seen from the report of the Commissioners bearing
date December 13, 1696.This amount has been disposed of as follows:--


        For the Assizer                      Rds.60.0.0.0
        For the assistant to the Assizer      "    6.0.0.0
        Balance to the Company's account      "   14.3.8.2 1/2
                                                  ============
                                    Total    Rds.80.3.8.2 1/2


It must be seen to that the Assizer, having been sworn, observes
his instructions as extracted from the Statutes of Batavia, as made
applicable to the customs of this country by the Government here on
March 3, 1666.In compliance with orders from Batavia contained in the letter of June
24, 1696, sums on interest may not be deposited with the Company here,
as may be seen also from a letter sent from here to Batavia on August
18 following, where it is stated that all money deposited thus must
be refunded.This order has been carried out, and the only deposits
retained are those of the Orphan Chamber, the Deaconate, the Seminary,
and the Widows' fund, for which permission had been obtained by letter
of December 15 of the same year.As the Seminary no longer possesses
any fund of its own, no deposit on that account is now left with
the Company.Your Honours must see that no other sums on interest
are accepted in deposit, as this Commandement has more money than
is necessary for its expenditure and even to assist other stations,
such as Trincomalee, &c., for which yearly Rds.16,000 to 18,000
are required, and this notwithstanding that Coromandel receives the
proceeds from the sale of elephants here, while we receive only the
money drafts.[46]

No money drafts are to be passed here on behalf of private persons,
whether Company's servants or otherwise, in any of the outstations,
but in case any person wishes to remit money to Batavia, this may be
done only after permission and consent obtained from His Excellency
the Governor at Colombo.When this is obtained, the draft is prepared
at Colombo and only signed here by the Treasurer on receipt of the
amount.This is specially mentioned here in order that Your Honours may
also remember in such cases the Instructions sent by the Honourable the
Government of India in the letters of May 3, 1695, and June 3, 1696,
in the former of which it is stated that no copper coin, and in the
latter that Pagodas are to be received here on behalf of the Company
for such drafts, each Pagoda being counted at Rds.[47]

The golden Pagoda is a coin which was never or seldom known to be
forged, at least so long as the King of Golconda or the King of the
Carnatic was sovereign in Coromandel.But the present war, which has
raged for the last ten years in that country, seems to have taken away
to some extent the fear of evil and the disgrace which follows it,
and to have given opportunity to some to employ cunning in the pursuit
of gain.It has thus happened that on the coast beyond Porto Novo,
in the domain of these lords of the woods (Boschheeren) or Paligares,
Pagodas have been made which, although not forged, are yet inferior
in quality; while the King of Sinsi Rama Ragie is so much occupied
with the present war against the Mogul, that he has no time to pay
attention to the doings of these Paligares.According to a statement
made by His Excellency the Governor Laurens Pyl and the Council of
Negapatam in their letter of November 4, 1695, five different kinds
of such inferior Pagodas have been received, valued at 7 3/8, 7 1/8,
7 5/8, 7 7/8, and 8 3/4 of unwrought gold.A notice was published
therefore on November 18, following, to warn the people against the
acceptance of such Pagodas, and prohibiting their introduction into
this country.When the Company's Treasury was verified by a Committee,
1,042 of these Pagodas were found.Intimation was sent to Colombo on
December 31, 1695.The Treasurer informed me when I was in Colombo
that he had sent them to Trincomalee, and as no complaints have been
received, it seems that the Sinhalese in that quarter did not know
how to distinguish them from the current Pagodas.As I heard that
the inferior Pagodas had been already introduced here, while it was
impossible to get rid of them, as many of the people of Jaffnapatam
and the merchants made a profit on them by obtaining them at a lower
rate in Coromandel and passing them here to ignorant people at the
full value, a banker from Negapatam able to distinguish the good from
the inferior coins has been asked to test all Pagodas, so that the
Company may not suffer a loss.But in spite of this I receive daily
complaints from Company's servants, including soldiers and sailors,
that they always have to suffer loss on the Pagodas received from
the Company in payment of their wages, when they present them at the
bazaar; while the chetties and bankers will never give them 24 fanums
for a Pagoda.This matter looks very suspicious, and may have an evil
influence on the Company's servants, because it is possible that the
chetties have agreed among themselves never to pay the full value
for Pagodas, whether they are good or bad.It is also possible that
the Company's cashier or banker is in collusion with the chetties,
or perhaps there is some reason for this which I am not able to
make out.However this may be, Your Honours must try to obtain as
much information as possible on this subject and report on it to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.All inferior
Pagodas found in the Company's Treasury will have to be made good by
the cashier at Coromandel, as it was his business to see that none
were accepted.With a view to prevent discontent among the Company's
servants the tax collectors must be made to pay only in copper and
silver coin for the poll tax and land rent, and out of this the
soldiers, sailors, and the lower grades of officials must be paid,
as I had already arranged before I left.I think that they can easily
do this, as they have to collect the amount in small instalments from
all classes of persons.The poor people do not pay in Pagodas, and the
collectors might make a profit by changing the small coin for Pagodas,
and this order will be a safeguard against loss both to the Company
and its servants.It would be well if Your Honours could find a means
of preventing the Pagodas being introduced and to discard those that
are in circulation already, which I have so far not been able to
do.Perhaps on some occasion you might find a suitable means.[48]

The demands received here from out-stations in this Commandement must
be met as far as possible, because it is a rule with the Company that
one district must accommodate another, which, I suppose, will be
the practice everywhere.Since His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo have authorized Your Honours in their letter of
June 13,1696, to draw directly from Coromandel the goods required from
those places for the use of this Commandement, Your Honours must avail
yourselves of this kind permission, which is in agreement with the
intention of the late Commissioner van Mydregt, who did not wish that
the order should pass through various hands.Care must be taken to send
the orders in due time, so that the supplies may not run out of stock
when required for the garrisons.The articles ordered from Jaffnapatam
for Manaar must be sent only in instalments, and no articles must be
sent but those that are really required, as instructed; because it
has occurred more than once that goods were ordered which remained
in the warehouses, because they could not be sold, and which, when
going bad, had to be returned here and sold by public auction, to
the prejudice of the Company.To give an idea of the small sale in
Manaar, I will just state here that last year various provisions and
other articles from the Company's warehouses were sent to the amount
of Fl.1,261.16.6--cost price--which were sold there at Fl.2,037,
so that only a profit of Fl.775.3.10 was made, which did not include
any merchandise, but only articles for consumption and use.[49]

The Company's chaloups [50] and other vessels kept here for the
service of the Company are the following:--


            The chaloup "Kennemerland.""'t Wapen van Friesland."The small chaloup "Manaar."Further, 14 tonys [51] and manschouwers, [52] viz.:--


            4 tonys for service in the Fort.1 tony  in Isle de Vacoa.in the islands "De Twee Gebroeders."Three manschouwers for the three largest chaloups, one manschouwer for
the ponton "De Hoop," one manschouwer for the ferry at Colombogamme,
one manschouwer for the ferry between the island Leiden and the fort
Kayts or Hammenhiel.The chaloups "Kennemerland" and "Friesland" are used mostly for the
passage between Coromandel and Jaffnapatam, and to and fro between
Jaffnapatam and Manaar, because they sink too deep to pass the river
of Manaar to be used on the west coast of Ceylon between Colombo and
Manaar.They are therefore employed during the northern monsoon to
fetch from Manaar such articles as have been brought there from Colombo
for this Commandement, and also to transport such things as are to
be sent from here to Colombo and Manaar, &c. They also serve during
the southern monsoon to bring here from Negapatam nely, cotton goods,
coast iron, &c., and they take back palmyra wood, laths, jagerbollen,
[53] coral stone, also palmyra wood for Trincomalee, and corsingos,
oil, cayro, [54] &c. The sloop "Jaffnapatam" has been built more
for convenience, and conveys usually important advices and money, as
also the Company's servants.As this vessel can be made to navigate
the Manaar river, it is also used as a cruiser at the pearl banks,
during the pearl fishery.It is employed between Colombo, Manaar,
Jaffnapatam, Negapatam, and Trincomalee, wherever required.The small
sloops "Manaar" and "De Visser," which are so small that they might
sooner be called boats than sloops, are on account of their small
size usually employed between Manaar and Jaffnapatam, and also for
inland navigation between the Passes and Kayts for the transport of
soldiers, money, dye-roots from The Islands, timber from the borders
of the Wanni, horses from The Islands; while they are also useful
for the conveyance of urgent advices and may be used also during the
pearl fishery.The sloop "Hammenhiel," being still smaller than the
two former, is only used for convenience of the garrison at Kayts,
the fort being surrounded by water.This and a tony are used to
bring the people across, and also to fetch drinking water and fuel
from the "Barren Island."The three pontons are very useful here,
as they have daily to bring fuel and lime for this Castle, and they
are also used for the unloading of the sloops at Kayts, where they
bring charcoal and caddegans, [55] and fetch lunt from the Passes,
and palmyra wood from the inner harbours for this place as well
as for Manaar and Colombo.They also bring coral stone from Kayts,
and have to transport the nely and other provisions to the redoubts
on the borders of the Wanni, so that they need never be unemployed
if there is only a sufficient number of carreas or fishermen for the
crew.At present there are 72 carreas who have to perform oely service
on board of these vessels or on the four tonies mentioned above.(50)

In order that these vessels may be preserved for many years, it
is necessary that they be keelhauled at least twice a year, and
rubbed with lime and margosa oil to prevent worms from attacking
them, which may be easily done by taking them all in turn.It must
also be remembered to apply to His Excellency the Governor and the
Council for a sufficient quantity of pitch, tar, sail cloth, paint,
and linseed oil, because I have no doubt that it will be an advantage
to the Company if the said vessels are kept constantly in repair.As
stated under the heading of the felling of timber, no suitable wood
is found in the Wanni for the parts of the vessels that remain under
water, and therefore no less than 150 or 200 kiate or angely boards of
2 1/2, 2, and 1 1/2 inches thickness are required yearly here for this
purpose.His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo have
promised to send this yearly, in answer to the request from Jaffnapatam
of February 17, 1692, and since this timber has to be obtained from
Mallabaar I will see whether I cannot send it directly by a private
vessel in case it cannot be obtained from Colombo.Application must be
made for Dutch sailors from Colombo to man the said sloops, which are
at present partly manned by natives for want of Europeans.According to
the latest regulation, 95 sailors are allowed for this Commandement,
while at present we have not even half that number, as only 46 are
employed, which causes much inconvenience in the service.The fortifications of the Castle have now for a few years been
complete, except the moat, which is being dug and has advanced to the
peculiar stratum of rocks which is found only in this country.All
matters relating to this subject are to be found in the Compendiums
for 1693, 1694, and 1695.Supposing that the moat could be dug to the
proper depth without danger to the fort, it could not be done in less
than a few years, and it cannot very well be accomplished with the
services of the ordinary oeliaars, so that other means will have to be
considered.If, on the other hand, the moat cannot be deepened without
danger to the foundations of the fort, as stated in the Compendium
for 1694, it is apparent that the project ought to be abandoned.In
that case the fort must be secured in some other way.The most natural
means which suggests itself is to raise the wall on all sides except
on the river side by 6 or 8 feet, but this is not quite possible,
because the foundation under the curtains of the fortification, the
faces of the bastion, and the flanks have been built too narrow,
so that only a parapet of about 11 feet is left, which is already
too small, while if the parapet were extended inward there would not
be sufficient space for the canons and the military.The best plan
would therefore be to cut away the hills that are found between the
Castle and the town.The earth might be thrown into the tank found
eastward of the Castle, while part of it might be utilized to fill
up another tank in the town behind the orphanage.This was the plan
of His Excellency van Mydregt, although it was never put down in
writing.Meantime care must be taken that the slaves and other native
servants of persons residing in the Castle do not through laziness
throw the dirt which they are supposed to carry away from the fort on
the opposite bank of the moat, and thus raise a space which the Company
would much rather lower, and gradually and imperceptibly prepare a
suitable place for the battery of an enemy.I have had notices put
up against this practice, under date July 18, 1695, and these must be
maintained and the offenders prosecuted.Considering the situation of
the Castle and the present appearance of the moat, I think that the
latter is already sufficiently deep if always four or five feet water
be kept in it.In order to do this two banks would have to be built,
as the moat has communication in two places with the river, while the
river also touches the fort at two points.This being done I think
the moat could be kept full of water by two or three water mills
driven by wind and pumps, especially during the south-west monsoon
or the dry season, when an attack would be most likely to occur,
and there is always plenty of wind to keep these mills going both
by night and day.A sluice would be required in the middle of these
banks so that the water may be let out whenever it became offensive
by the river running dry, to be filled again when the water rose.It
would have to be first ascertained whether the banks could really
be built in such a way that they would entirely stop the water in
the moat, because they would have to be built on one side against
the foundations of the fort, which I have been told consist of large
irregular rocks.An experiment could be made with a small mill of the
kind used in Holland in the ditches along bleaching fields.They are
quite inexpensive and easily erected and not difficult to repair,
as they turn on a dovetail.The late Commandeur Anthony Paviljoen
also appears to have thought of this plan even before this Castle was
built, when the Portuguese fort was occupied by the Company, as may
be seen from his instructions of December 19, 1665.[56] This would,
in my opinion, be the course to follow during the south-west monsoon,
while during the north-east monsoon there is usually so much rain that
neither the salt river nor the water mills would be required, while
moreover during that time there is little danger of an attack.These
three plans being adopted, the banks of the moat could be protected by
a wall of coral stone to prevent the earth being washed away by the
water, as the present rocky bed of the moat is sufficiently strong
to serve as a foundation for it.The moat has already been dug to
its proper breadth, which is 10 roods.In my opinion there are two other defects in this Castle: the one
is as regards the embrazures, the other is in the new horse stable
and carpenters' yard, which are on the south side just outside the
opposite bank of the moat.I think these ought to be altered, for
the reasons stated in our letter to Colombo of November 30, 1695.I
was however opposed by the Constable-Major Toorse in his letter of
December 16 next, and his proposal was approved in Batavia by letter
of July 3 following.This work will therefore have to remain as it is,
although it appears that we did not explain ourselves sufficiently;
because Their Excellencies seem to think that this yard and stable
were within the knowledge of His Excellency van Mydregt.It is true
that the plan for them was submitted to His Excellency, as may be seen
from the point submitted by the late Mr.Blom on February 17, 1692,
and April 29, 1691, but no answer was ever received with regard to
this matter, on account of the death of His Excellency van Mydregt,
[57] and I have an idea that they were not at all according to his
wish.However, the yard and stable will have to remain, and with
regard to the embrazures the directions of the Constable-Major must
be followed.If it be recommended that the deepening of the moat is possible
without danger to the fort, and if the plan of the water mills and
banks be not approved, so that a dry moat would have to suffice,
I think the outer wall might be completed and the ground between
the rocks be sown with a certain kind of thorn called in Mallabaar
Oldeaalwelam and in Dutch Hane sporen (cock spurs), on account of
their resemblance to such spurs in shape and stiffness.This would
form a covering of natural caltrops, because these thorns are so sharp
that they will penetrate even the soles of shoes, which, besides,
all soldiers in this country do not wear.Another advantage in these
thorns is that they do not easily take fire and do not grow higher
than 2 or 2 1/2 feet above the ground, while the plants grow in quite
a tangled mass.I thought it might be of some use to mention this here.The present bridge of the fort is built of palmyra wood, as I found
on my arrival from Batavia; but as the stone pillars have already
been erected for the construction of a drawbridge, this work must be
completed as soon as the timber that I ordered from the Wanni for this
purpose arrives.In the carpenters' yard some timber will be found that
was prepared three years ago for the frame of this drawbridge, which,
perhaps, could yet be utilized if it has been well preserved.This
work will have to be hurried on, for the present bridge is dangerous
for anything heavy to pass over it, such as elephants, &c. It will
also be much better to have a drawbridge for the fortification.The
bridge must be built as broad as the space between the pillars and
the opposite catches will permit, and it must have a strong wooden
railing on either side, which may be preserved for many years by
the application of pitch and tar, while iron is soon wasted in this
country unless one always has a large quantity of paint and linseed
oil.Yet, an iron railing is more ornamental, so I leave this matter
to Your Honours.[51]

The fortress Hammenhiel is in good condition, but the sand bank
upon which it is built has been undermined by the last storm in the
beginning of December during the north-east monsoon.The damage must
be remedied with stones.In this fortress a reservoir paved with
Dutch bricks has been built to collect and preserve the rain water,
but it has been built so high that it reaches above the parapets
and may thus be easily ruined by an enemy, as I have pointed out in
my letter to Colombo of September 8, 1694.As this is a new work it
will have to remain as present, until such time as alterations can
be made.The ramparts of this fortress, which are hollow, have been
roofed with beams, over which a floor of stone and chunam has been
laid, with a view to the space below being utilized for the storing
of provisions and ammunition.This is a mistake, as the beams are
liable to decay and the floor has to support the weight of the canon,
so that there would be danger in turning the guns round for fear of
the floor breaking down.So far back as the time of Commandeur Blom
a beginning was made to replace this roof by an entire stone vault,
which is an important work.The gate of the fortress, which is still
covered with beams, must also be vaulted.[52]

Ponneryn and the passes Pyl, Elephant, and Buschutter only
require a stone water tank, but they must not be as high as that of
Hammenhiel.Dutch bricks were applied for from Jaffnapatam on February
17, 1692, and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo
promised to send them here as soon as they should arrive from the
Fatherland, so that Your Honours must wait for these.Ponneryn is
not so much in want of a reservoir, as it has a well with fairly good
drink water.[53]

The work that demands the chief attention in Manaar is the deepening
of the moat, as the fortifications, dwelling houses, and stores are
completed.But since this work has to be chiefly carried out by the
Company's slaves, it will take some time to complete it.There are
also several elevations near the fort which will have to be reduced,
so that they may not at any time become a source of danger.During
my circuit on two or three occasions the Opperhoofd and the Council
at Manaar applied for lime to be sent from here, as no more coral
stone for the burning of lime was to be found there.This takes
away the Company's sloops from their usual employment, and the
officials have been informed that they must get the lime made
from the pearl shells which are found in abundance in the bay of
Condaatje as remains of the fishery.It makes very good lime, and
the forests in the neighbourhood provide the fuel, and the lime can
then be brought to Manaar in pontons and tonys.Information on this
subject may be found in the correspondence between this station and
Jaffnapatam.Care must be taken that the lime of the pearl shells
is used for nothing but the little work that has yet to be done in
the fort, such as the pavements for the canons and the floors of the
galleries in the dwelling houses.The Opperhoofd and other officers
who up to now have been living outside the fort must now move into
it, as there are many reasons why it is undesirable that they should
reside outside--a practice, besides, which is against the Company's
rules with regard to military stations in India.(54)

Provisions and ammunition of war are matters of foremost consideration
if we desire to have our minds at ease with regard to these stations,
for the one is necessary for the maintenance of the garrison and the
officials, while the other is the instrument of defence.These two
things ought at all times to be well provided.His late Excellency
van Mydregt for this reason very wisely ordered that every station
should be stocked with provisions for two years, as may be seen in
the letter sent from Negapatam bearing date March 17, 1688.This is
with regard to the Castle, but as regards the outstations it will be
sufficient if they are provided with rice for six or eight months.On
account of the great expense the Castle has not of late been provided
for two years, but this will soon be changed now that the passage to
Trincomalee and Batticaloa has been opened, even if the scarcity in
Coromandel should continue, or if the Theuver should still persist in
his prohibition of the importation of nely from Tondy.I have heard,
however, that this veto has been withdrawn, and that vessels with this
grain will soon arrive here.If this rumour be true and if a good
deal of rice is sent here from Cotjaar, Tammelegan, and Batticaloa,
a large quantity of it might be purchased on behalf of the Company
with authority of His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo, which might be obtained by means of our sloops.Perhaps
also the people of Jaffnapatam who come here with their grain may be
prevailed upon to deliver it to the Company at 50 per cent.or so
less, as may be agreed upon.This they owe to their lawful lords,
since the Company has to spend so much in governing and protecting
them.Sanction to this measure was granted by His Excellency van
Mydregt in his letter from Negapatam to Jaffnapatam of June 12, 1688,
which may be looked up.If a calculation be made of the quantity of
provisions required for two years, I think it would be found that it
is no less than 300 lasts of rice a year.This includes provisions
for the garrison and those who would have to come into the fort in
case of a siege, so that 600 lasts would be required for two years,
a last being equal to 3,000 lb.or 75 Ceylon parras, thus in all
45,000 parras.At the rate of one parra per month for each person,
1,875 people could be maintained for two years with this store of
rice.This would be about the number of people the Company would
have to provide for in case of necessity, considering that there are
according to the latest regulations 600 Company's servants, while
there are according to the latest enumeration 1,212 women, children,
and slaves in the town, making a total of 1,812 persons who have to be
fed; so that the above calculation is fairly correct.Sometimes also
Manaar will have to be provided, because Mantotte does not yield a
sufficient quantity of nely to supply that fort for two years.This
must also be included in the calculation, and if Your Honours are
well provided in this manner you will be in a position to assist some
of the married soldiers, the orphanage, and the poor house with rice
from the Company's stores in times of scarcity, and will be able to
prevent the sale in rice being monopolized again.It was the intention
of His Excellency van Mydregt that at such times the Company's stores
should be opened and the rice sold below the bazaar price.Care must
be taken that this favour is not abused, because it has happened
that some of the Company's servants sent natives on their behalf,
who then sold the rice in small quantities at the market price.This
was mentioned in our letter to Colombo of October 1 and December 12,
1695.The Company can hardly have too much rice in store, for it can
always be disposed of with profit when necessary, and therefore I think
600 lasts need not be the limit, so long as there is a sufficient
number of vessels available to bring it.But as rice alone will not
suffice, other things, such as salt, pepper, bacon, meat, &c., must
also be considered.Salt may be obtained in sufficient quantities
in this Commandement, but pepper has to be obtained from Colombo,
and therefore this spice must never be sold or issued from the store
houses until the new supply arrives, keeping always 3,000 or 4,000
lb.Bacon and meat also have to be obtained from Colombo,
and His Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo were kind
enough to send us on my verbal request ten kegs of each from Galle
last August by the ship "Nederland."But I find that it has become
stale already, and it must be changed for new as soon as possible,
with authority of His Excellency and the Council, in order that it may
not go further bad.In compliance with the orders of His Excellency
van Mydregt in his letter of November 23, 1687, the old meat and
bacon must be returned to Colombo, and a new supply sent here every
three or four years, the stale meat being supplied in Colombo to
some of the Company's vessels.But considering that His Excellency
the Governor and the Council of Colombo are not always in a position
to supply Jaffnapatam with a sufficient quantity of meat and bacon,
as there are so many other stations in Ceylon to be provided for,
it would be well to keep in mind the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen
that in emergencies 1,000 or 1,200 cattle could be captured and kept
within the fort, where they could be made to graze on the large plain,
while as much straw from the nely would have to be collected as could
be got together to feed these animals as long as possible.This
small loss the inhabitants would have to bear, as the Company has to
protect them and their lands, and if we are victorious a recompense
could be made afterwards.I would also advise that as much carrawaat
[58] as could be found in the quarters of the Carreas, Palwelys,
[59] and other fishermen should be brought into the fort; because
this dried fish makes a very good and durable provision, except
for the smell.The provision of arrack must also not be forgotten,
because used moderately this drink does as much good to our people as
it does harm when taken in large quantities.As I have heard so many
complaints about the arrack here, as well as in Trincomalee, at the
pearl fishery, at Coromandel, &c., it is apparent that the Company is
not properly served in this respect.On this account also some arrack
was returned from Negapatam and the Bay of Condaatje.Henceforth
no arrack must be accepted which has not been tested by experts,
neither for storing in the warehouses nor for sending to the different
stations, because at present I cannot say whether it is adulterated by
the people who deliver it to the Company or by those who receive it
in the stores, or even by those who transport it in the sloops.With
regard to the munitions of war, I think nothing need be stated here,
but that there is a sufficient stock of it, because by the last stock
taking on August 31, 1696, it appears that there is a sufficient
store of canons, gun-carriages, gunpowder, round and long grenades,
instruments for storming, filled fire bombs, caseshot-bags, martavandes
for the keeping of gunpowder, and everything that pertains to the
artillery.The Arsenal is likewise sufficiently provided with guns,
muskets, bullets, native side muskets, &c. I would only recommend that
Your Honours would continue to have ramrods made for all the musket
barrels which are still lying there, suitable timber for which may be
found in the Wanni.It is from there also that the boards are obtained
for gun-carriages.And as I found that some had not been completed,
I think this work ought to be continued, so that they may be ready
when wanted.No doubt His Excellency the Governor and the Council of
Colombo will be willing to send a sufficient quantity of pitch and
tar for the preservation both of the sloops and the gun-carriages,
which otherwise will soon decay during the heavy rains which we have
here in India.Although the Arsenal is at present well provided with
guns and muskets, it is possible that half of them may be found unfit
for use.I have therefore given orders to examine them all carefully,
so that those that are unfit may be sent to Colombo and from there to
the Fatherland, and new ones returned.Water and fuel are also two of
the most important things to think of for the defence of a fortress,
and I had therefore a large room built behind the smith's shop where
fuel could be stored away.This room must be stocked and closed, and
no fuel issued from it to any one.Those who receive firewood from
the Company may be supplied from that which is daily brought from the
forest.With regard to the water which is found within this Castle,
it is drinkable in cases of emergency, especially in some of the
wells found there.[55]

The military and garrison would be sufficiently strong if the full
number of Europeans allowed for this Commandement by the latest
Batavian regulation of December 29, 1692, could be obtained, which
could not be considered too strong for a Commandement numbering
608 men in all, including those for commercial, civil, judicial,
ecclesiastical, naval, and military services.At present we have only
the following number of persons in the Company's service, who have
to be classified, as they are of different colour and descent, viz.:--


                            Europeans.In the Castle              287         56        7       350
    In Manaar                   52          2        9        63
    In Hammenhiel               21          4        1        26
    In Ponneryn                  1          1       21        23
    In the redoubts the
    "Pyl," "Beschutter,"
    and "Elephant"              11          3       45        59
    For various services,
    also in the Island,
    for  surveying, wood
    felling, &c.13         10        2        25
                               ===        ===      ===       ===
                    Total      385         76       85       546


In the number of Europeans is included, as stated above, all manner
of Company's servants employed in the Trade, Church, Navigation,
Military Duties, &c., all of which together number 385 men.The 76
mestises and the 85 toepasses will therefore have to be retained until
this Commandement can have its full number of Europeans, and it would
be well if Your Honours would continue to engage a few more toepasses
when they offer themselves, because the Passes are hardly sufficiently
guarded; about which matter communication has been made in our letter
to Colombo of March 5, 1695.Your Honours must also keep in mind the
recommendation of His Excellency van Mydregt in his letter of March
27, 1688, wherein he suggests that a close watch should be kept on
the Wannias, as they are not to be trusted in a case of treason on
the part of the Sinhalese; and on this account the advanced guards
must be always well provided with ammunition and provisions, while
discipline and drill must be well attended to, so that as far as lies
in our power we may be prepared for emergencies.I have been rather prolix in treating of the fortifications and all
that pertains thereto, not so much because I am ignorant of the fact
that the Company's power in India depends more on her naval force
than on her fortresses, but because I consider that since the latter
are in our possession it is our duty to preserve them, as otherwise
the large amount expended on them at the beginning of the Government
in Ceylon would have been spent in vain.[56]

The public works are carried out here without expenditure to the
Company by the Oeliaars, because, as stated before, no cooly wages
are paid here, payment being made only to the native artisans, such
as smiths, carpenters, and masons.The number of men employed is
daily entered in a book by one of the Pennisten of the Comptoirs,
which he has to hand over in the evening to the person whose turn
it will be the next day to do this work.Care must be taken that
these assistants personally see and count the men, and the payments
must be made according to their list and not according to those of
the Dutch foremen or the native Cannecappuls.This is in compliance
with the orders from Batavia.The foremen of the carpenters' yard,
the smiths' shop, the gunpowder mill, and the masonry works must
also every evening, at sunset, bring in their reports with regard to
the progress of the work.This is to be done by the sergeant Hendrik
Rademaker, who, for some years, has been acting as overseer of the
Oeliaars.The Oeliaars are changed on Mondays and Thursdays, each
of them working only for three days at a time, which suffices for
three months, as they owe twelve days of service in the year.Those
who have performed their labour receive an ola from the Cannecappul,
which is called a Sito, and is marked with a steel stamp thus: I-VOC,
which serves them as a receipt.The names of those who fail to appear
are written down by the Cannecappul and by the Majoraal, and they
have to pay a fine which is called sicos.[60] The stamp is in the
custody of the Chief, who also arranges and divides the work among
the Oeliaars.He must see that the sergeant does not allow any of
the coolies to depart before the three days have expired, and making
a profit for himself and causing loss to the Company.Care must also
be taken that no more than 18 persons are employed as Pandarepulles
or native cooly drivers, who are each in charge of 16 to 30 men,
whom they have to keep to their work.These 18 Pandarepulles must be
appointed by written documents, otherwise the sergeant appoints such
officers on his own authority and thus also makes a profit.Then
also it must be seen that the materials, such as timber, bricks,
lime, &c., are not taken to other places than they have been ordered
for by the person in authority, for all these are tricks to which
the Company is subject on the part of the overseers when they see
that no regard is taken of their doings.The principal of the public
works at present in progress is the building of the church within the
fort, [61] which has advanced to 8 feet above the ground, and may be
completed during the southern season, if there is only a sufficient
quantity of bricks.According to my calculation about 1,000,000 more
will be required, which is a large quantity, but will not cost more
than 3 fannums per thousand, and even this expense does not fall to
the Company, but may be found out of the sicos or fines.The Dessave
has the best opportunity for seeing that the work at the brickworks
at Iroewale is pushed on as quickly as possible, so that there may
be no waiting for bricks or tiles, which are also baked there and
paid at the rate of 3 1/2 fannums a thousand.I consider it a shame
that in a country where the cost of building is so small, and where
religion is to be promoted, there should not even be a church in
the fort, a state of things that has existed these last four years,
during which the warehouses had to be used for this purpose, while
many old and infirm people could not attend the services because of
the inconvenience of the steps that lead to them.It would have been
better if the old Portuguese church had not been broken down before
the building of the new church was commenced, because an old proverb
says: "That one must not cast away old shoes till one has got new
ones."[62] However, for the present we must row with the oars we
possess, until the new church is completed, the plan for which is in
the hands of the surveyor Martinus Leusekam.The sergeant in the Wanni,
Harmen Claasz, had already on my orders felled the necessary beams,
and now the rafters must be thought of, which would be best made
of palmyra wood, if they could be obtained sufficiently long.The
timber for the pulpit I hope to send from Mallabaar, but as ebony is
also found in the Wanni, some trees might be felled also there and be
brought down here without expenditure to the Company.As may be seen
in the answers to the questions from Jaffnapatam of March 12, 1691,
and February 17, 1692, authority for the building of this church was
obtained long ago.The only other works required within the Castle
at present are the barracks for the married soldiers; which may be
found indicated in the map, and the rebuilding of the four dwelling
houses yet remaining of the Portuguese buildings which are old and
decayed.They are no longer worth repairing, and it would be best
if they were broken down and new and better houses built on their
site.But before this is done it will be necessary to rebuild the
Armoury, which fell into ruins last December.This building also
remained from the Portuguese.Some new tiles are also required for
the Company's building at Anecatte where the red-dyeing is done,
the cross-beams of which building I had renewed.Likewise a number
of tiles is required for the new warehouses in the island Leyden,
which have been built there in compliance with the orders of His
late Excellency van Mydregt.This was when it was intended to provide
Ceylon with grain from Tansjouwer, [63] which was to be laid up there
before the northern season.These warehouses may yet come in useful
if the Moorish trade flourishes.[57]

The horse stable within the fort has been built in a bad place,
and is very close and unhealthy; so that the animals die one after
another.It would therefore be better if the stable referred to
under the heading of "fortification" and situated outside the fort be
used.If this is done it must be provided with the necessary cribs,
&c., and not more than seven horses have been allowed by the last
regulation.The supervision of the stable has been entrusted for some
time to the Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but I could not approve of
this, and consider it better that this supervision be also left to
the chief person in authority, the more so as the said Captain has
been troubled for the last five years with gout and gravel; so that
he has often to remain at home for weeks, while, even when he is well,
it is impossible for him to go about much, in consequence of weakness
arising from the pain.For this reason he cannot properly supervise
the stable; and this is not the first time he is excused from his
duty, as it was done also during the time of Commandeur Cornelis van
der Duyn, who also considered that it was more in the interest of
the Company that this and other duties should be performed by the
chief instead of by private persons.The Dessave is best aware if
the hides of the stags and elks sent to this stable from the Wanny
and the Passes are properly utilized for saddles, carriages, &c.,
in the said stable, and also in the Arsenal for cartridge cases,
bandoleers, sword-belts, &c.[58]

The hospital was built too low, so that the patients had to lie in
damp places during the northern monsoon.I therefore had the floor
raised, in view of the fact that this is a place where the Company
shows its sympathy with its suffering servants and wishes them to have
every comfort.For this reason also regents are appointed to see that
nothing wrong is done by the doctor or the steward.For some time this
supervision was entrusted to Captain Jan van der Bruggen, but for the
reason stated above I cannot approve of the arrangement any longer,
while moreover, his daughter is the wife of the Chief Surgeon Hendrick
Warnar, who has a very large family, and suspicious people might try to
find fault with the arrangement.The supervision of the hospital must
therefore be entrusted every alternate month to the Administrateur
Biermans and the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, as it is against the
principles of the Company to entrust such work to one person only.[59]

The Company's slaves here are few in number, consisting of 82
individuals, including men, boys, women, and children.But no more are
required, as the Oeliaars perform many of the duties for which slaves
would be otherwise required.They are employed in the stable, the
warehouses, the arsenal, the hospital, and with the shipbuilders and
masons.The only pay they receive is 3 fannums and a parra of rice per
month, except some of the masons.This payment is sufficient for some
of them, but not for all, as there are some employed in masonry work
who do their work as well as any of the natives, and, as they have to
maintain a wife and children, the master mason has often recommended
higher pay for them.There is one among the masons who receives
6 fannums a month, another gets 4, and two others 3 fannums.This
might be raised from 6 to 10, from 4 to 8, and from 3 to 6 fannums
respectively, so that these poor people may not be discouraged; and on
the other hand increased pay often produces increased labour, and thus
the Company would perhaps not lose by the extra expense.The matter
must, however, be submitted to His Excellency the Governor, as also
the request of one of the masons that his daughter may be emancipated,
in order to marry a native who has proposed to her.The father offers
in her place as a slave another young and capable woman.There is also
another application for emancipation from a dyer who is now, he says,
60 years of age.The Company would lose nothing in granting this
request, because all he delivers is two or three pieces of ordinary
chintz a year.All these matters must be submitted to His Excellency
the Governor and the Council.[60]

Having now treated of the Wanny, of the lands of Ponneryn and Mantotte
within the Province of Jaffnapatam, and of the fort, we must see what
is to be said with regard to the seacoast, and also if any important
matter has been forgotten.Manaar is the last island on this side, and the banks and islets near
it form together what is called "Adam's Bridge," which closes the
passage between Ceylon and Coromandel.This island also protects
Jaffnapatam on the south, as no vessel could come here without
passing Manaar.The passage through the river is so inconvenient on
account of its shallowness that no vessel can pass without being first
unloaded.Therefore no vessel is able to pass nor any smuggling take
place without its being known in Manaar.It is on this account that
an order was issued by His Excellency the Governor and the Council
in their letter of March 5, 1695, to Jaffnapatam, to the effect that
no smuggled areca-nut from Colombo or Calpentyn must be allowed to
pass there.This was when the trade in these waters was re-opened
for private enterprise from Coromandel, and the order was conveyed
by us to Manaar by letter of March 11.A close watch must be kept,
but so long as the passage of Ramacoil or Lembe in the domain of the
Teuver is so well known by some people as it is said to be, it is
not likely that attempts at smuggling would be made in Manaar.[61]

Manaar not only protects Jaffnapatam, but it also yields to the
Company the profits of Mantotte, Moesely, and Setticoulang, and of
the capture of elephants.The latter might be more if not for the
death of the animals, as, for instance, last year, when not a single
animal delivered by the hunters survived.The hunters must therefore
be encouraged to bring as many as possible.[62]

About 50 or 60 bharen of dye-roots are also yearly obtained from
Manaar, which cultivation must also be attended to, in order that
the Company may be in a position to deliver the red cloths ordered
from this Commandement.[63]

Some revenue is also obtained from taxes and rents.These are yearly
sold to the highest bidder.Last year they were sold for 1 1/2 year,
like those in Jaffnapatam.2,268, as also
Rds.879.7.8 for poll tax and land rent in Manaar.The tithes of the
harvest in Mantotte are paid in grain, which is usually issued to the
Company's servants.This amounted on the last occasion to 1,562 1/2
paras of rice.The tax in cooking butter in Mantotte is also paid
in kind and likewise issued to the Company's servants.Besides,
there are 3,000 or 4,000 paras of salt and 10,000 or 12,000 coils
of straw or bark lunt which the inhabitants of the opposite lands
have to deliver, as also chanks from the divers; but these do not
amount to much, for, in 1695, were dived five kinds of cauries to
the amount of 204 5/8 paras, and in 1696 only 94 7/8 paras; so that
the amount for two years was only 299 1/2 paras of cauries.For this
reason I submitted on May 10, 1695, to His Excellency the Governor
and the Council, a proposal from the Moor Perietamby, who offered to
pay the Company yearly Rds.8,000 for the license to dive for chanks
between Manaar and Calpentyn.This was refused by the reply received
from Colombo on the 17th of the same month.[64]

From the Instructions to Commandeur Blom sent from Colombo on February
17, 1692, it may be seen what prices are paid to the divers for the
chanks, mentioned already under the subject of the Moorish trade,
so that it is not necessary to enter into detail on the subject here.I think that I have now sufficiently explained all matters relating to
this station, and would refer for further information to the report
compiled by Mr.Blom for Governor van Mydregt, which is kept here at
the Secretariate, [64] as also the answers thereto of September 13 and
October 7, 1690.Jorephaas
Vosch for the Opperkoopman Jan de Vogel, bearing date August 30, 1666,
[65] which may also be read, but I think that I have mentioned all
the most important matters with regard to Manaar appearing therein.The pearl fishery is an extraordinary enterprise, the success of
which depends on various circumstances; as there are various causes
by which the banks or the oysters may be destroyed.It would take too
long to mention here all that may be said on the subject, and as it
would be tiresome to read it all, I will merely state here that the
usual place for the fishery is near Aripo in the Bay of Condaatje,
where the banks lie, and if no untoward events take place, a fishery
may be held for several years in succession; because the whole bay
is covered with different banks, the oysters of which will become
successively matured.But sometimes they are washed away and completely
destroyed within a very short time.The banks are to be inspected in
November by a Commission sent for this purpose, who come in tonys from
Jaffnapatam, Manaar, and Madura, and with them also some Patangatyns
and other native chiefs who understand this work.The chief points to
be considered when a pearl fishery has been authorized are the lodgings
for the Commissioners appointed in Colombo; the inclosure of the tanks
in Mantotte with banks for obtaining good drinking water; the supply
of poultry, butter, oil, rice, sheep, cattle, &c., for provisions;
Lascoreens and servants; military men, if they can be spared from
the garrison, &c. The fishery usually takes place in the months of
March, April, and May.I will not enter into detail on this matter,
as it would not be in agreement with the nature of these instructions;
while the Commissioners will be able to find ample information in the
various documents of the years 1666 and 1667, but especially in those
of 1694, 1695, and 1696, including reports, journals, and letters, in
case they have not gained sufficient experience yet.These documents
relate to the fishery, the collection of the Company's duties, the
purchase and valuation of pearls, &c. I will therefore only state
here the successive profits derived from the pearl fishery by the
Company, viz.:--


                   Rds.1666       19,655    91/980       58,965.11.6
        1667       24,641   461/968       73,924.8.13
        1694       21,019    19/60        63,057.13.0
        1695       24,708    11/12        74,126.15.0
        1696       25,327    43/60        75,983.0
                  =======   =======      =============
           Total  115,352   499/960      346,057.11.3 [66]


This is a considerable amount, and it is expected, according to the
reports of the Commissioners, that the fishery now authorized for
December 31, 1697, will yield still greater profits.I have already
given orders for the repair of the banks of the tanks in Mantotte,
which were damaged during the last storm, in order that there may
be no want of drinking water, which is one of the most important
points.Whether the prohibition to export coconuts from this Province
applies also to the pearl fishery is a matter to be submitted to
His Excellency the Governor and the Council; because many people use
this fruit as food.This subject has been already dealt with under
the head of Coconuts.[65]

The inhabited little islands are considered as the fifth Province
of the Commandement, the others being Walligammo, Waddemoraatsche,
Timmeraatsche, and Patchelepalle.Taxes, &c., are levied in these
islands in the same way as in the other Provinces, the revenue
amounting last time to Rds.2,767.2.5 1/2, viz.:--


                                              Rds.Land rent                                1,190.11.3
    Tithes                                     712.8.6 1/4
    Poll tax                                   605.1.0
    Adigary                                    173.9.0
    Officie                                    162.5.8 3/4
                                             --------------
                               Total         2,844.11.8

    Deducted as salaries for the Collector,
    Majoraal, Cayals, &c.9.2 1/4
                                             ==============
                               Total         2,767.2.5 1/2 [67]


The islands are named as follows:--

Carredive, called by us Amsterdam; Tamiedive, Leyden; Pongedive,
Middleburg; Nerendive, Delft; Neynadive, Haarlem; Aneledive, Rotterdam;
Remedive, "de Twee Gebroeders," or Hoorn and Enkhuisen.Besides the revenue stated above, Carredive yields the best dye-roots
in this Commandement, although the quantity is no more than 10 or
12 bharen a year.The dye-roots from Delft are just as good, but it
yields only 4 or 5 bharen a year.Salt, lime, and coral stone are
also obtained from these islands, but particulars with regard to these
matters have been stated at length in the report by the late Commandeur
Blom to His late Excellency van Mydregt, to which I would refer.[66]

Horse-breeding is an enterprise of which much was expected, but so far
the Company has not made much profit by it.Yet there is no reason
to despair, and better results may be hoped for.Your Honours must
remember that formerly in the islands Delft, Hoorn, and Enkhuizen all
kinds of horses were bred together; so that but few good animals were
obtained.In 1690 and 1691 orders were given to shoot all horses that
were too small or defective, and to capture the rest and send them to
Colombo and Coromandel.The latter were sold at Negapatam by public
auction, while the rest were given to soldiers on the opposite coast
in the Company's service, who used the animals so badly that they were
soon unfit for work.In this way the islands have become destitute
of horses, and the only thing to be done was to send there some good
mares and two or three Persian stallions for breeding purposes.So
far no good horses could be obtained, because a foal has to be 4 or
3 1/2 years old before it is fit for use.It is only since 1692,
1693, and 1694 that we had good stallions, and this accounts for
the fact that no foals have yet been obtained.8,982.9, so that it would seem as if expenditure and
trouble are the only results to be expected from this enterprise;
but it must be remembered that at present there are on the island of
Delft alone about 400 or 500 foals of 1, 1 1/2, 2, and 2 1/2 years
old, while there are also a number of horses on the island "de Twee
Gebroeders."The expenditure was incurred mostly in the purchase of the
Persian stallions, and this expenditure has not been in vain, because
we possess now more than 400 horses, each of which will be worth about
a hundred guilders, so that the whole number will be worth about 40,000
guilders.In compliance with the orders by His Excellency van Mydregt
of November 29, 1690, these animals must be sold at Coromandel on
account of this Commandement, and the valuation of the horses may be
determined from the fact that the Prince of Tansjour has accepted one
or two of them in lieu of the recognition which the Company owes him
yearly for two Arabian horses.For this reason and in compliance with
the said orders the first horses captured must be sent to Negapatam,
so that the account in respect of horse-breeding may be balanced.As
the stallions kept on the islands have become too old, application
has been made for younger animals, and also for five or six mares
from Java, which have been granted by His Excellency the Governor
and the Council in their letter of April 29, 1695.Your Honours are
further advised not to sell any horses from the island of Delft for
less than Rds.25 and from the islands "de Twee Gebroeders" for less
than Rds.35 to the Company's servants, as they fetch more than that
at the public auctions in Negapatam.Even this is a favour to them;
but I noticed that the horses from Delft have been sold at 15 and
those from Hoorn and Enkhuisen at Rds.20, which I think cannot be
done in future, since the destruction of the defective animals has
improved the race.I hope that this will clear up the passage with
regard to the horse-breeding in the letter from Batavia to Ceylon of
July 3, 1696, as also that Their Excellencies may be satisfied with
the result.I think expectations were raised too high at first; as
the real advantage could only be known in course of time; while, on
the other hand, the capital expended must be looked upon as standing
out on interest.[67]

The Passes of this Commandement are various, but all are guarded in
such a way that no goods can be brought in or taken out without a
license, nor are people able to go through without a passport.At
Kayts and Point Pedro passports are issued in the usual way to
those who come or go by sea; while to those who travel by land an
Acte of Permission is issued, which is written in Mallabaar on ola,
and is called Cayoppe.These are issued both by the Dessave and by
the Commandeur, but as so many thousands of people come and go, and
the signing of these Cayoppes occupies so much of the time of the
Commandeurs, a steel stamp is used now by the Dessave to mark these
also.I have followed the same practice, and used a seal with the
letters H. Z., [68] which I handed over shortly before my departure for
Colombo in February, 1696, to the Political Council, together with the
seal for the oely service, with instructions that these seals were to
be used just as if I were still on the spot, because the Dessave was
absent at the pearl fishery, and I was commissioned by the Supreme
Government of India to proceed to Mallabaar without being formally
relieved of my office in this Commandement.On my return from Colombo
in August I found that this order had not been carried out, but that
the Captain Jan van der Bruggen had thought it well to have another
seal specially made, with the monogram VOC, not only suppressing my
order given to him in full Council, but also having a new seal made,
which was beyond his authority and seemed to me quite out of place.I
cannot account for his extraordinary conduct in any other way than by
supposing that he desired to confirm the rumour which had been spread
among the natives and Europeans during the time of the Commissioners
Messrs.Jan van Keulen and Pieter Petitfilz, that I would never return
to this Commandement to rule, and thus by suppressing my seal to give
public confirmation to this rumour, and so make it appear to the world
that it was no longer legal.I therefore order again that this seal is
not to be suppressed, but used for the stamping of the Cayoppes at the
Passes in case the Dessave should be absent from this Commandement,
it being his province alone to issue and sign such olas.This order
is to be carried out as long as no contrary orders are received from
higher authorities.Colomboture and Catsay are two Passes on the inner boundary of this
Commandement at the river leading to Ponneryn and the Wanny, and
in order to prevent any one passing without a passport a guard is
stationed there.The duties on goods are also collected there, being
leased out, but they do not amount to much.These Passes, however,
must be properly guarded, and care taken that the people stationed
there submit their reports regularly.One of these may be found in
a letter from here to Colombo of December 12 last.Ponneryn, a good redoubt, serves as a place from where to watch the
doings of the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from invasions.It
is garrisoned by Toepasses under the command of a Dutch Sergeant.The Passes Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter serve chiefly to close this
Province against the Wannias and to protect the inhabitants from
invasions of the Sinhalese, and also to prevent persons passing in
or out without a passport, or goods being taken in or out without a
license, as also to prevent the theft of slaves and the incursions of
elephants and other wild animals into the Provinces.A difficulty is
that the earth mounds are not close together, so that notwithstanding
the continual patrol of the militia, now and again a person passes
through unnoticed.Means of drawing these redoubts together, or at
least of making a trench to prevent persons or goods from passing
without a license, have often been considered.Some have proposed
a hedge of palmyra trees, others a fence of thorns, others a moat,
others again a wall, because at this point the Commandement measures
only two miles in breadth.But none of these proposals have been
adopted all these years, as stated in our letter of August 24, 1695,
to Batavia.Their Excellencies replied in their letter of July 3,
1696, that this is a good work, but as it is entirely to the advantage
of the inhabitants it must be carried out without expense to the
Company.This, in my humble opinion, is quite fair, and the Dessave,
whom this matter principally concerns, will have to consider in what
way such a trench as proposed could be made.The yearly Compendium
will give much information on this subject, and will show what defects
and obstacles have been met with.It has been stated already how the
Passes are garrisoned, and they are commanded by an Ensign according
to the regulations.Point Pedro, on the outer boundary of this Commandement, has resident
only one Corporal and four Lascoreens, who are chiefly employed in
the sending and receiving of letters to and from Coromandel and
Trincomalee, in the loading of palmyra wood and other goods sent
from there to the said two places, and in the search of departing
and arriving private vessels, and the receipt of passports.These men
also supervise the Oeliaars who have to work at the church which was
commenced during the time of Commandeur Blom, and also those who have
to burn lime or break coral stone from the old Portuguese fortress.The fortress Kayts or Hammenhiel serves on the north, like Manaar
in the south, to guard the passage by water to this Castle, and
also serves the same purposes as Point Pedro, viz., the searching of
private vessels, &c. Next to this fort is the island Leyden, where is
stationed at present the Assistant Jacob Verhagen, who performs the
same duties as the Corporal at Point Pedro, which may be found stated
more in detail in the Instructions of January 4, 1696, compiled and
issued by me for the said Assistant.The Ensign at the Passes received
his instructions from Commandeur Blom, all of which must be followed.As the Dessave is Commander over the military scattered in the
country, and therefore also over those stationed at the said Passes
and stations, it will chiefly be his duty to see that they are
properly guarded so far as the small garrison here will permit,
and also that they are provided with sufficient ammunition and
provisions.The latter consist mostly of grain, oil, pepper, and
arrack.This is mostly meant for Hammenhiel, as the other places can
always be provided from the land side, but rice and ammunition must be
always kept in store.Hammenhiel must be specially garrisoned during
the southern monsoon, and be manned as much as possible by Dutchmen,
who, if possible, must be transferred every three months, because many
of these places are very unhealthy and others exceedingly lonesome,
for which reasons it is not good to keep the people very long in one
place.The chief officers are transferred every six months, which also
must not be neglected, as it is a good rule in more than one respect.Aripo, Elipoecarrewe, and Palmeraincattoe were formerly fortresses
garrisoned like the others, but since the revolution of the Sinhalese
and the Wannias of 1675, under the Dessave Tinnekon, these have
become unnecessary and are only guarded now by Lascoreens, who are
mostly kept on for the transport of letters between Colombo, Manaar,
and Jaffnapatam.[68]

Water tanks are here very necessary, because the country has no fresh
water rivers, and the water for the cultivation of lands is that which
is collected during the rainfall.Some wealthy and influential natives
contrived to take possession of the tanks during the time the Company
sold lands, with a view of thus having power over their neighbours
and of forcing them to deliver up to them a large proportion of their
harvests.They had to do this if they wished to obtain water for
the cultivation of their fields, and were compelled thus to buy at
high price that which comes as a blessing from the Lord to all men,
plants, and animals in general.His Excellency Laurens Pyl, then
Governor of Ceylon, issued an order in June, 1687, on his visit to
this Commandement, that for these reasons no tanks should be private
property, but should be left for common use, the owners being paid
by those who require to water their fields as much as they could
prove to have spent on these tanks.I found that this good order
has not been carried out, because the family of Sangere Pulle alone
possesses at present three such tanks, one of which is the property
of Moddely Tamby.Before my departure to Colombo I had ordered that
it should be given over to the surrounding landowners, who at once
offered to pay the required amount, but I heard on my return that
the conveyance had not been made yet by that unbearably proud and
obstinate Bellale caste, they being encouraged by the way their patron
Moddely Tamby had been favoured in Colombo, and the Commandeur is
not even recognized and his orders are passed by.Your Honours must
therefore see that my instructions with regard to these tanks are
carried out, and that they are paid for by those interested, or that
they are otherwise confiscated, in compliance with the Instructions
of 1687 mentioned above, which Instructions may be found among the
papers in the Mallabaar language kept by the schoolmasters of the
parishes.Considering that many of the Instructions are preserved in
the native language only, they ought to be collected and translated
into our Dutch language.[69]

The public roads must be maintained at a certain breadth, and the
natives are obliged to keep them in order.But their meanness and
impudence is so great that they have gradually, year by year, extended
the fences along their lands on to these roads, thus encroaching
upon the high road.They see more and more that land is valuable on
account of the harvests, and therefore do not leave a foot of ground
uncultivated when the time of the rainy season is near.This is quite
different from formerly; so much so, that the lands are worth not
only thrice but about four or five times as much as formerly.This
may be seen when the lands are sold by public auction, and it may
be also considered whether the people of Jaffnapatam are really so
badly off as to find it necessary to agitate for an abatement of the
tithes.The Dessave must therefore see that these roads are extended
again to their original breadth and condition, punishing those who
may have encroached on the roads.[70]

The Company's elephant stalls have been allowed to fall into decay
like the churches, and they must be repaired as soon as possible,
which is also a matter within the province of the Dessave.[71]

Great expectations were cherished by some with regard to the thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Besoar stones, Carret, and tusks from the
elephants that died in the Company's stalls, but experience did
not justify these hopes.As these points have been dealt with in the
Compendium of November 26, 1693, by Commandeur Blom, I would here refer
to that document.I cannot add anything to what is stated there.[72]

The General Paresse is a ceremony which the Mudaliyars, Collectors,
Majoraals, Aratchchies, &c., have to perform twice a year on behalf
of the whole community, appearing together before the Commandeur in
the fort.This is an obligation to which they have been subject from
heathen times, partly to show their submission, partly to report on
the condition of the country, and partly to give them an opportunity
to make any request for the general welfare.As this Paresse tends
to the interest of the Company as Sovereign Power on the one hand
and to that of the inhabitants on the other hand, the custom must be
kept up.When the Commandeur is absent at the time of this Paresse
Your Honours could meet together and receive the chiefs.It is held
once during the northern and once during the southern monsoon, without
being bound to any special day, as circumstances may require it to be
held earlier or later.During my absence the day is to be fixed by the
Dessave, as land regent.Any proposal made by the native chiefs must
be carefully written down by the Secretary, so that it may be possible
to send a report of it to His Excellency the Governor and the Council
if it should be of importance.All transactions must be carefully
noted down and inserted in the journal, so that it may be referred to
whenever necessary.The practice introduced by the Onderkoopman William
de Ridder in Manaar of requiring the Pattangatyns from the opposite
coast to attend not twice but twelve times a year or once a month is
unreasonable, and the people have rightly complained thereof.De Ridder also appointed
a second Cannekappul, which seems quite unnecessary, considering the
small amount of work to be done there for the natives.Jeronimo could
be discharged and Gonsalvo retained, the latter having been specially
sent from Calpentyn by His Excellency Governor Thomas van Rhee and
being the senior in the service.Of how little consequence the work
at Manaar was considered by His Excellency Governor van Mydregt may
be seen from the fact that His Excellency ordered that no Opperhoofd
should be stationed there nor any accounts kept, but that the fort
should be commanded by an Ensign as chief of the military.A second
Cannekappul is therefore superfluous, and the Company could be saved
the extra expense.[73]

I could make reference to a large number of other matters, but it
would be tedious to read and remember them all.I will therefore now
leave in Your Honours' care the government of a Commandement from which
much profit may be derived for the Company, and where the inhabitants,
though deceitful, cunning, and difficult to rule, yet obey through
fear; as they are cowardly, and will do what is right more from fear of
punishment than from love of righteousness.I hope that Your Honours
may have a more peaceful time than I had, for you are well aware
how many difficulties, persecutions, and public slights I have had to
contend with, and how difficult my government was through these causes,
and through continual indisposition, especially of late.However,
Jaffnapatam has been blessed by God during that period, as may be seen
from what has been stated in this Memoir.I hope that Your Honours'
dilligence and experience may supplement the defects in this Memoir,
and, above all, that you will try to live and work together in harmony,
for in that way the Company will be served best.There are people who
will purposely cause dissension among the members of the Council,
with a view to further their own ends or that of some other party,
much to the injury of the person who permits them to do so.[74]

The Political Council consists at present of the following members:--


Ryklof de Bitter, Dessave, Opperkoopman.Abraham M. Biermans, Administrateur.Pieter Boscho, Onderkoopman, Store- and Thombo-keeper.Johannes van Groenevelde, Fiscaal.Pieter Bout, Cashier and Secretary.With a view to enable His Excellency the Governor and the Council to
alter or amplify this Memoir in compliance with the orders from Their
Excellencies at Batavia, cited at the commencement of this document,
I have purposely written on half of the pages only, so that final
instructions might be added, as mine are only provisional.In case
Your Honours should require any of the documents cited which are
not kept here at the Secretariate, they may be applied for from His
Excellency the Governor and the Council of Colombo.Wishing Your
Honours God's blessing, and all prosperity in the administration of
this extensive Commandement,


I remain, Sirs,
Yours faithfully,
H. ZWAARDECROON.Jaffnapatam, January 1, 1697.A.--The above Instructions were ready for Your Honours when, on
January 31 last, the yacht "Bekenstyn" brought a letter from Colombo
dated January 18, in which we were informed of the arrival of our new
Governor, His Excellency Gerrit de Heere.By the same vessel an extract
was sent from a letter of the Supreme Government of India of October
19 last, in which my transfer to Mallabaar has been ordered.But,
much as I had wished to serve the Company on that coast, I could
not at once obey the order owing to a serious illness accompanied
by a fit, with which it pleased the Lord to afflict me on January
18.Although not yet quite recovered, I have preferred to undertake
the voyage to Mallabaar without putting it off for another six months,
trusting that God will help me duly to serve my superiors, although
the latter course seemed more advisable on account of my state of
health.As some matters have occurred and some questions have arisen
since the writing of my Memoir, I have to add here a few explanations.B.--Together with the above-mentioned letter from Colombo, of January
18, we also received a document signed by both Their Excellencies
Governors Thomas van Rhee and Gerrit de Heere, by which all trade
in Ceylon except that of cinnamon is made open and free to every
one.Since no extract from the letter from Batavia with regard to this
matter was enclosed, I have been in doubt as to how far the permission
spoken of in that document was to be extended.As I am setting down
here my doubt on this point, His Excellency the Governor and the
Council of Colombo will, I have no doubt, give further information
upon it.I suppose that the trade in elephants is excepted as well
as that in cinnamon, and that it is still prohibited to capture,
transport, or sell these animals otherwise than on behalf of the
Company, either directly or indirectly, as has been the usage so far.C.--I suppose there will be no necessity now to obtain the areca-nuts
as ordered in the Instructions from Colombo of March 23, 1695, but
that these nuts are included among the articles open to free trade,
so that they may be now brought from Jaffnapatam through the Wanni to
Tondy, Madura, and Coromandel, as well as to other places in Ceylon,
provided the payment of the usual Customs duty of the Alphandigo,
[69] which is 7 1/2 per cent.for export, and that it may also be
freely transported through the Passes on the borders of the Wanni, and
that no Customs duty is to be paid except when it is sent by sea.I
understand that the same will be the rule for cotton, pepper, &c.,
brought from the Wanni to be sent by sea.This will greatly increase
the Alphandigo, so that the conditions for the farming of these must
be altered for the future accordingly.If the Customs duty were also
charged at the Passes, the farming out of these would still increase,
but I do not think that it would benefit the Company very much, because
there are many opportunities for smuggling beyond these three Passes,
and the expenditure of keeping guards would be far too great.The
duty being recovered as Alphandigo, there is no chance of smuggling,
as the vessels have to be provided with proper passports.All vessels
from Jaffnapatam are inspected at the Waterfort, Hammenhiel and at
the redoubt Point Pedro.D.--In my opinion the concession of free trade will necessitate the
remission of the duty on the Jaffnapatam native and foreign cloths,
because otherwise Jaffnapatam would be too heavily taxed compared
with other places, as the duty is 20 and 25 per cent.I think both
the cloths made here and those imported from outside ought to be
taxed through the Alphandigo of 7 1/2 per cent.This would still more
increase the duty, and this must be borne in mind when these revenues
are farmed out next December, if His Excellency the Governor and the
Council approve of my advice.is far too
high, and it must be remembered that this was a duty imposed with a
view to prevent the weaving of cloths and to secure the monopoly of
the trade to the Company, and not in order to make a revenue out of
it.This project did not prove a success; but I will not enter into
details about it, as these may be found in the questions submitted
by me to the Council of Ceylon on January 22, 1695, and I have also
mentioned them in this Memoir under the heading of Rents.E.--It seems to me that henceforth the people of Jaffnapatam would,
as a result of this free trade, be no longer bound to deliver to the
Company the usual 24 casks of coconut oil yearly before they are
allowed to export their nuts.This rule was laid down in a letter
from Colombo of October 13, 1696, with a view to prevent Ceylon being
obliged to obtain coconut oil from outside.This duty was imposed
upon Jaffnapatam, because the trees in Galle and Matura had become
unfruitful from the Company's elephants having to be fed with the
leaves.The same explanation was not urged with regard to Negombo,
which is so much nearer to Colombo than Galle, Matura, or Jaffnapatam,
and it is a well-known fact that many of the ships from Jaffnapatam
and other places are sent with coconuts from Negombo to Coromandel
or Tondel, while the nuts from the lands of the owners there are held
back.I expect therefore that the new Governor His Excellency Gerrit
de Heere and the Council of Colombo will give us further instructions
with regard to this matter.More details may be found in this Memoir
under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--A letter was received from Colombo, bearing date March 4 last,
in which was enclosed a form of a passport which appears to have been
introduced there after the opening of the free trade, with orders to
introduce the same here.This has been done already during my presence
here and must be continued.G.--In the letter of the 9th instant we received various and important
instructions which must be carried out.An answer to this letter was
sent by us on the 22nd of the same month.One of these instructions is
to the effect that a new road should be cut for the elephants which are
to be sent from Colombo.Another requires the compilation of various
lists, one of which is to be a list of all lands belonging to the
Company or given away on behalf of it, with a statement showing by
whom, to whom, when, and why they were granted.I do not think this
order refers to Jaffnapatam, because all fields were sold during the
time of Commandeur Vosch and others.Only a few small pieces of land
were discovered during the compilation of the new Land Thombo, which
some of the natives had been cultivating.A few wild palmyra trees
have been found in the Province of Patchelepalle, but these and the
lands have been entered in the new Thombo.We cannot therefore very
well furnish such a list of lands as regards Jaffnapatam, because
the Company does not possess any, but if desired a copy of the new
Land Thombo (which will consist of several reams of imperial paper)
could be sent.I do not, however, think this is meant, since there is
not a single piece of land in Jaffnapatam for which no taxes are paid,
and it is for the purpose of finding this out that the new Thombo is
being compiled.H.--The account between the Moorish elephant purchasers and the
Company through the Brahmin Timmerza as its agent, about which so
much has been written, was settled on August 31 last, and so also
was the account of the said Timmerza himself and the Company.A
difficulty arises now as to how the business with these people is
to be transacted; because three of the principal merchants from
Galconda arrived here the other day with three cheques to the amount
of 7,145 Pagodas in the name of the said Timmerza.According to the
orders by His Excellency Thomas van Rhee the latter is no longer to
be employed as the Company's agent, so there is some irregularity
in the issue of these cheques and this order, in which it is stated
that the cheques must bear the names of the purchasers themselves,
while on the other hand the purchasers made a special request that
the amount due to them might be paid to their attorneys in cash or
elephants through the said Timmerza.However this may be, I do not
wish to enter into details, as these matters, like many others, had
been arranged by His Excellency the Governor and the Council without
my knowledge or advice.Your Honours must await an answer from His
Excellency the Governor Gerrit de Heere and the Council of Colombo,
and follow the instructions they will send with regard to the said
cheques; and the same course may be followed as regards the cheques
of two other merchants who may arrive here just about the time of my
departure.I cannot specify the amount here, as I did not see these
people for want of time.The merchants of Golconda have also requested
that, as they have no broker to deal with, they may be allowed an
advance by the Company in case they run short of cash, which request
has been communicated in our letter to Colombo of the 4th instant.I.--As we had only provision of rice for this Commandement for
about nine months, application has been made to Negapatam for 20,000
paras of rice, but a vessel has since arrived at Kayts from Bengal,
belonging to the Nabob of Kateck, by name Kaimgaarehen, and loaded as
I am informed with very good rice.If this be so, the grain might be
purchased on behalf of the Company, and in that case the order for
nely from Negapatam could be countermanded.It must be remembered,
however, that the rice from Bengal cannot be stored away, but must
be consumed as soon as possible, which is not the case with that of
Negapatam.The people from Bengal must be well treated and assisted
wherever possible without prejudice to the Company; so that they
may be encouraged to come here more often and thus help us to make
provision for the need of grain, which is always a matter of great
concern here.I have already treated of the Moorish trade and also
of the trade in grain between Trincomalee and Batticaloa, and will
only add here that since the arrival of the said vessel the price
has been reduced from 6 to 5 and 4 fannums the para.K.--On my return from Colombo last year the bargemen of the Company's
pontons submitted a petition in which they complained that they had
been obliged to make good the value of all the rice that had been lost
above 1 per cent.from the cargoes that had been transported from
Kayts to the Company's stores.They complained that the measuring
had not been done fairly, and that a great deal had been blown away
by the strong south-west winds; also that there had been much dust in
the nely, and that besides this it was impossible for them to prevent
the native crew who had been assigned to them from stealing the grain
both by day and night, especially since rice had become so expensive
on account of the scarcity.I appointed a Committee to investigate
this matter, but as it has been postponed through my illness, Your
Honours must now take the matter in hand and have it decided by
the Council.In future such matters must always be brought before
the Council, as no one has the right to condemn others on his own
authority.The excuse of the said bargemen does not seem to carry
much weight, but they are people who have served the Company for 30
or 40 years and have never been known to commit fraud.It must also
be made a practice in future that these people are held responsible
for their cargo only till they reach the harbour where it is unloaded,
as they can only guard it on board of their vessels.L.--I have spoken before of the suspicion I had with regard to the
changing of golden Pagodas, and with a view to have more security in
future I have ordered the cashier Bout to accept no Pagodas except
directly from the Accountant at Negapatam, who is responsible for the
value of the Pagodas.He must send them to the cashier in packets of
100 at a time, which must be sealed.M.--The administration of the entire Commandement having been left by
me to the Opperkoopman and Dessave Mr.Ryklof de Bitter and the other
members of the Council, this does not agree with the orders from the
Supreme Government of India contained in their letter of October 19
last year, but since the Dessave de Bitter has since been appointed as
the chief of the Committee for the pearl fishery and has left already,
it will be for His Excellency the Governor and the Council to decide
whether the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz is to be entrusted with the
administration, as was done last year.Wishing Your Honours for the second time God's blessing,


I remain,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) H. ZWAARDECROON.On board the yacht "Bekenstyn," in the harbour of
Manaar, March 29, 1697.SHORT NOTES by Gerrit de Heere, Governor of the Island of Ceylon,
    on the chief points raised in these Instructions of Commandeur
    Hendrick Zwaardecroon, for the guidance of the Opperkoopman
    Mr.Ryklof de Bitter, Second in authority and Dessave of the
    Commandement, and the other members of the Political Council of
    Jaffnapatam.Where the notes contradict the Instructions the orders
    conveyed by the former are to be followed.In other respects the
    Instructions must be observed, as approved by Their Excellencies
    the Governor-General and the Council of India.The form of Government, as approved at the time mentioned here, must
be also observed with regard to the Dessave and Secunde, Mr.Ryklof
de Bitter, as has been confirmed by the Honourable the Government of
Batavia in their special letter of October 19 last.What is stated here is reasonable and in compliance with the
Instructions, but with regard to the recommendation to send to
Mr.Zwaardecroon by Manaar and Tutucorin advices and communications
of all that transpires in this Commandement, I think it would be
sufficient, as Your Honours have also to give an account to us, and
this would involve too much writing, to communicate occasionally
and in general terms what is going on, and to send him a copy of
the Compendium which is yearly compiled for His Excellency the
Governor.de Bitter and the other members of
Council to do.The Wanni, the largest territory here, has been divided by the
Company into several Provinces, which have been given in usufruct to
some Majoraals, who bear the title of Wannias, on the condition that
they should yearly deliver to the Company 42 1/2 alias (elephants).The
distribution of these tributes is as follows:--


                                                        Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
    for the Provinces of--

        Tinnemerwaddoe                                            2

    Don Peria Meynaar, for the Province of--
        Moeliawalle                                               3 1/2
                                                                 ======

The accumulated arrears from the years 1680 to 1694, of which they
were discharged, amounted to 333 1/2 elephants.From that time up to
the present day the arrears have again accumulated to 86 3/4 alias,
namely:--


                                                   Alias.Don Philip Nellamapane                        57 1/2
        Don Diogo Poevenelle Mapane                   23
        Peria Meynaar Oediaar                          4 3/4
        Chedoega Welemapane                            1 1/2
                                                      ======
                     Total                            86 3/4


The result proves that all the honour and favours shown to these people
do not induce them to pay up their tribute; but on the contrary,
as has been shown in the annexed Memoir, they allow them to go on
increasing.This is the reason I would not suffer the indignity of
requesting payment from them, but told them seriously that this would
be superfluous in the case of men of their eminence; which they,
however, entirely ignored.I then exhorted them in the most serious
terms to pay up their dues, saying that I would personally come within
a year to see whether they had done so.As this was also disregarded,
I dismissed them.Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarenne,
who owed 57 1/2 alias, made the excuse that these arrears were caused
by the bad terms on which they were with each other, and asked that
I would dissociate them, so that each could pay his own tribute.I
agreed that they should arrange with the Dessave about the different
lands, writing down on ola the arrangements made, and submitting them
to me for approval; but as I have heard no more about the matter up
to the present day, I fear that they only raised these difficulties
to make believe that they were unable to pay, and to try to get the
Company again to discharge them from the delivery of their tribute
of 21 elephants for next year.It would perhaps be better to do this
than to be continually fooled by these people.But you have all
seen how tremblingly they appeared before me (no doubt owing to a
bad conscience), and how they followed the palanquin of the Dessave
like boys, all in order to obtain more favourable conditions; but I
see no reason why they should not pay, and think they must be urged
to do so.They have promised however to pay up their arrears as soon
as possible, so that we will have to wait and see; while Don Diogo
Poevenelle Mapane also has to deliver his 23 alias.In compliance with
the orders from Colombo of May 11, 1696, Don Philip Nellamapane will be
allowed to sell one elephant yearly to the Moors, on the understanding
that he had delivered his tribute, and not otherwise; while the sale
must be in agreement with the orders of Their Excellencies at Batavia,
contained in their letter of November 13, 1683.The other Provinces,
Carnamelpattoe, Tinnemerwaddoe, and Moeliawalle are doing fairly well,
and the tribute for these has been paid; although it is rather small
and consists only of 9 1/2 alias (elephants), which the Wannias there,
however, deliver regularly, or at least do not take very long in
doing so.Perhaps they could furnish more elephants in lieu of the
tithes of the harvest, and it would not matter if the whole of it
were paid in this way, because this amount could be made up for by
supplies from the lands of Colombo, Galle, and Matara, or a larger
quantity could be ordered overland.That the Master of the Hunt, Don Gasper Nitchenchen Aderayen, should,
as if he were a sovereign, have put to death a Lascoreen and a hunter
under the old Don Gaspar on his own responsibility, is a matter which
will result in very bad consequences; but I have heard rumours to
the effect that it was not his work, but his father's (Don Philip
Nellamapane).With regard to these people Your Honours must observe
the Instructions of Mr.Zwaardecroon, and their further actions must be
watched; because of their conspiracies with the Veddas, in one of which
the brother of Cottapulle Odiaar is said to have been killed.Time
does not permit it, otherwise I would myself hold an inquiry.Mantotte, Moesely, and Pirringaly, which Provinces are ruled by
officers paid by the Company, seem to be doing well; because the
Company received from there a large number of elephants, besides the
tithes of the harvest, which are otherwise drawn by the Wannias.The
two Wannias, Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar, complain that
they do not receive the tribute of two elephants due to them from the
inhabitants of Pirringaly, but I do not find in the decree published
by Commandeur Blom on June 11, 1693, in favour of the inhabitants,
any statement that they owe such tribute for liberation from the rule
of the Wannias, but only that they (these Wannias) will be allowed
to capture elephants.These Wannias, however, sent me a dirty little
document, bearing date May 12, 1694, in which it is stated that the
hunters of Pirringaly had delivered at Manaar for Pannengamo in the
year 1693 two alias, each 4-3/8 cubits high.If more evidence could be
found, it might be proved that such payment of 2 alias yearly really
had to be made, and it would be well for Your Honours to investigate
this matter, because it is very necessary to protect and assist the
hunters as much as possible, as a reward for their diligence in the
capture of elephants.Payment must be made to them in compliance with
the orders of His Excellency van Mydregt.Ponneryn, the third Province from which elephants should
be obtained, and which, like Illepoecarwe, Polweraincattoe, and
Mantotte, was ruled formerly by an Adigar or Lieutenant-Dessave,
was doing fairly well; because the Company received yearly on an
average no less than 25 alias, besides the tithes of the harvest,
until in 1690 the mode of government was changed, and the revenue of
Ponneryn was granted by public decree to the young Don Gaspar by the
Lord Commissioner van Mydregt, while those of the other two Provinces
were granted to the old Don Gaspar, on condition that the young Don
Gaspar would capture and deliver to the Company all elephants which
could be obtained in the said Provinces, while the inhabitants of
Ponneryn would be obliged to obey the Master of the Hunt as far as
their services should be required by the Company and as they had been
accustomed to render.This new arrangement did not prove a success;
because, during seven years, he only delivered 44 elephants, although
in the annexed Memoir it is stated that he delivered 74.Of these 44
animals, 7 were tuskers and 37 alias, viz.:--

During the last two years he did not deliver a single animal,
so that the Company lost on account of this Master of the Hunt,
131 elephants.He only appropriated the tithes of the harvest, and
did not care in the least about the hunt, so that the Company is even
prevented from obtaining what it would have received by the old method;
and, I must say, I do not understand how these privileges have been
granted so long where they are so clearly against the interest of the
Company, besides being the source of unlawful usurpation practised
over the inhabitants, which is directly against the said deeds of
gift.The elephant hunters have repeatedly applied to be relieved of
their authority and to be allowed to serve again under the Company.For
these reasons, as Your Honour is aware, I have considered it necessary
for the service of the Company to provisionally appoint the sergeant
Albert Hendriksz, who, through his long residence in these Provinces,
has gained a great deal of experience, Adigar over Ponneryn; which
was done at the request of the elephant hunters.He will continue the
capture of elephants with the hunters without regard to the Master of
the Hunt, and Your Honour must give him all the assistance required,
because the hunt has been greatly neglected.Your Honour may allow
both the Don Gaspars to draw the tithes of the harvest until our
authorities at Batavia will have disposed of this matter.The trade in elephants is undoubtedly the most important, as
the rest does not amount to much more than Rds.7,000 to 9,000 a
year.During the year 1695-1696 the whole of the sale amounted to
Fl.33,261.5, including a profit of Fl.We find it stated
in the annexed Memoir that the merchants spoilt their own market by
bidding against each other at the public auctions, but whether this
was really the case we will not discuss here.I positively disapprove
of the complicated and impractical way in which this trade has been
carried on for some years, and which was opposed to the interests
of the Company.I therefore considered it necessary to institute
the public auctions, by which, compared with the former method, the
Company has already gained a considerable amount; which is, however,
no more than what it was entitled to, without it being of the least
prejudice to the trade.I will not enlarge on this subject further,
as all particulars relating to it and everything connected with it may
be found in our considerations and speculations and in the decisions
arrived at in accordance therewith, which are contained in the daily
resolutions from July 24 to August 20 inclusive, a copy of which was
left with Your Honours, and to which I refer you.As to the changed
methods adopted this year, these are not to be altered by any one
but Their Excellencies at Batavia, whose orders I will be obliged
and pleased to receive.As a number of elephants was sold last year
for the sum of Rds.53,357, it was a pity that they could not all
be transported at once, without a number of 126 being left behind on
account of the northern winds.We have therefore started the sale a
little earlier this year, and kept the vessels in readiness, so that
all the animals may be easily transported during August next.On the
20th of this month all purchasers were, to their great satisfaction,
ready to depart, and requested and obtained leave to do so.This year
the Company sold at four different auctions the number of 86 elephants
for the sum of Rds.36,950, 16 animals being left unsold for want of
cash among the purchasers, who are ready to depart with about 200
animals which they are at present engaged in putting on board.The
practice of the early preparation of vessels and the holding of
public auctions must be always observed, because it is a great loss
to the merchants to have to stay over for a whole year, while the
Company also suffers thereby, because in the meantime the animals
do not change masters.It is due to this reason and to the want of
ready cash that this year 16 animals were left unsold.In future it
must be a regular practice in Ceylon to have all the elephants that
are to be sold brought to these Provinces before July 1, so that all
preparations may be made to hold the auctions about the middle of July,
or, if the merchants do not arrive so soon, on August 1.Meanwhile
all the required vessels must be got ready, so that no animals need be
left behind on account of contrary winds.As we have now cut a road,
by which the elephants may be led from Colombo, Galle, and Matura,
as was done successfully one or two months ago, when in two trips
from Matura, Galle, Colombo, Negombo, and Putulang were brought here
with great convenience the large number of 63 elephants, the former
plan of transporting the animals in native vessels from Galle and
Colombo can be dropped now, a few experiments having been made and
proving apparently unsuccessful.It must be seen that at least 12 or
15 elephants are trained for the hunt, as a considerable number is
always required, especially if the animals from Putulang have to be
fetched by land.For this reason I have ordered that two out of the 16
animals that were left from the sale and who have some slight defects,
but which do not unfit them for this work, should be trained, viz.,
No 22, 5 3/8 cubits high, and No.72, 5 1/2 cubits high, which may
be employed to drive the other animals.Meanwhile the Dessave must
see that the two animals which, as he is aware, were lent to Don
Diogo, are returned to the Company.These animals were not counted
among those belonging to the Company, which was very careless.As is
known to Your Honours, we have abolished the practice of branding the
animals twice with the mark circled V, as was done formerly, once when
they were sent to these Provinces and again when they were sold, and
consider it better to mark them only once with a number, beginning
with No.1, 2, 3, &c., up to No.Ten iron brand numbers have
been made for this purpose.If there are more than 100 animals, they
must begin again with number 1, and as a mark of distinction a cross
must be put after each number, which rule must be observed in future,
especially as the merchants were pleased with it and as it is the best
way of identifying the animals.We trust that with the opening of the
King's harbours the plan of obtaining the areca-nut from the King's
territory by water will be unnecessary, but the plan of obtaining
these nuts by way of the Wanni will be dealt with in the Appendix.The trade with the Moors from Bengal must be protected, and these
people fairly and reasonably dealt with, so that we may secure the
necessary supply of grain and victuals.We do not see any reason
why these and other merchants should not be admitted to the sale of
elephants, as was done this year, when every one was free to purchase
as he pleased.The people of Dalpatterau only spent half of their
cash, because they wished to wait till next year for animals which
should be more to their liking.His Excellency the High Commissioner
informed me that he had invited not only the people from Golconda,
but also those of Tanhouwer, [70] &c., to take part in that trade,
and this may be done, especially now that the prospects seem to all
appearances favourable; while from the districts of Colombo, Galle,
and Matura a sufficient number of elephants may be procured to make
up for the deficiency in Jaffnapatam, if we only know a year before
what number would be required, which must be always inquired into.As the Manaar chanks are not in demand in Bengal, we have kept here a
quantity of 36 1/2 Couren of different kinds, intending to sell in the
usual commercial way to the Bengal merchants here present; but they
did not care to take it, and said plainly that the chanks were not of
the required size or colour; they must therefore be sent to Colombo by
the first opportunity, to be sent on to Bengal next year to be sold at
any price, as this will be better than having them lying here useless.The subject of the inhabitants has been treated of in such a way
that it is unnecessary for me to add anything.With regard to the tithes, I agree with Mr.Zwaardecroon that
the taxes need not be reduced, especially as I never heard that the
inhabitants asked for this to be done.It will be the duty of the
Dessave to see that the tenth of the harvest of the waste lands,
which were granted with exemption of taxes for a certain period, is
brought into the Company's stores after the stated period has expired.Poll tax.--It is necessary that a beginning should be made with
the work of revising the Head Thombo, and that the names of the old
and infirm people and of those that have died should be taken off the
list, while the names of the youths who have reached the required age
are entered.This renovation should take place once in three years,
and the Dessave as Land Regent should sometimes assist in this work.Officie Gelden.--It will be very well if this be divided according
to the number of people in each caste, so that each individual pays
his share, instead of the amount being demanded from each caste as
a whole, because it is apparent that the Majoraals have profited by
the old method.No remarks are at present necessary with regard to the Adigary.The Oely service, imposed upon those castes which are bound to
serve, must be looked after, as this is the only practicable means
of continuing the necessary works.The idea of raising the fine for
non-attendance from 2 stivers, which they willingly pay, to 4 stivers
or one fanam, [71] is not bad, but I found this to be the practise
already for many years, as may be seen from the annexed account of two
parties of men who had been absent, which most likely was overlooked
by mistake.This is yet stronger evidence that the circumstances
of the inhabitants have improved, and I therefore think it would be
well to raise the chicos from 4 stivers to 6 stivers or 1 1/2 fanam,
with a view to finding out whether the men will then be more diligent
in the performance of their duty; because the work must be carried on
by every possible means.Your Honours are again seriously recommended
to see that the sicos or fines specified in the annexed Memoir are
collected without delay, and also the amount still due for 1693,
because such delay cannot but be prejudicial to the Company.The old
and infirm people whose names are not entered in the new Thombo must
still deliver mats, and kernels for coals for the smith's shop.No
objections will be raised to this if they see that we do not slacken
in our supervision.Tax Collectors and Majoraals.--The payment of the taxes does not
seem satisfactory, because only Rds.180 have been paid yet out of
the Rds.2,975.1 due as sicos for the year 1695.It would be well
if these officers could be transferred according to the Instructions
of 1673 and 1675.It used to be the practice to transfer them every
three years; but I think it will be trouble in vain now, because when
an attempt was made to have these offices filled by people of various
castes, it caused such commotion and uproar that it was not considered
advisable to persist in this course except where the interest of the
Company made it strictly necessary.Perhaps a gradual change could
be brought about by filling the places of some of the Bellales when
they die by persons of other castes, which I think could be easily
done.Zwaardecroon seems to think it desirable that
the appointment of new officials for vacancies and the issuing of
the actens should be deferred till his return from Mallabaar or
until another Commandeur should come over, we trust that he does
not mean that these appointments could not be made by the Governor
of the Island or by the person authorized by him to do so.If the
Commandeur were present, such appointment should not be made without
his knowledge, especially after the example of the commotion caused
by the transfer of these officers in this Commandement, but in order
that Your Honours may not be at a loss what to do, it will be better
for you not to wait for the return of Mr.Zwaardecroon from Mallabaar,
nor for the arrival of any other Commandeur, but to refer these and
all other matters concerning this Commandement, which is subordinate
to us, to Colombo to the Governor and Council, so that proper advice
in debita forma may be given.The Lascoreens certainly make better messengers than soldiers.The
Dessave must therefore maintain discipline among them, and take
care that no men bound to perform other duties are entered as
Lascoreens.This they often try to bring about in order to be
excused from labour, and the Company is thus deprived of labourers
and is put to great inconvenience.I noticed this to be the case in
Colombo during the short time I was in Ceylon, when the labour had to
be supplied by the Company's slaves.There seems to be no danger of
another famine for some time, as the crop in Coromandel has turned out
very well.We cannot therefore agree to an increase of pay, although
it is true that the present wages of the men are very low.It must
be remembered, however, that they are also very simple people, who
have but few wants, and are not always employed in the service of
the Company; so that they may easily earn something besides if they
are not too lazy.We will therefore keep their wages for the present
at the rate they have been at for so many years; especially because
it is our endeavour to reduce the heavy expenditure of the Company
by every practicable means.We trust that there was good reason why
the concession made by His Excellency the Extraordinary Councillor
of India, Mr.Laurens Pyl, in favour of the Lascoreens has not been
executed, and we consider that on account of the long interval that
has elapsed it is no longer of application.The proposal to transfer
the Lascoreens in this Commandement twice, or at least once a year,
will be a good expedient for the reasons stated.The importation of slaves from the opposite coast seems to be most
profitable to the inhabitants of Jaffnapatam, as no less a number
than 3,584 were brought across in two years' time, for which they
paid 9,856 guilders as duty.It would be better if they imported a
larger quantity of rice or nely, because there is so often a scarcity
of food supplies here.It is also true that the importation of so many
slaves increases the number of people to be fed, and that the Wannias
could make themselves more formidable with the help of these men, so
that there is some reason for the question whether the Company does
not run the risk of being put to inconvenience with regard to this
Commandement.Considering also that the inhabitants have suffered
from chicken-pox since the importation of slaves, which may endanger
whole Provinces, I think it will be well to prevent the importation of
slaves.As to the larger importation on account of the famine on the
opposite coast, where these creatures were to be had for a handful of
rice, this will most likely cease now, after the better harvest.The
danger with regard to the Wannias I do not consider so very great, as
the rule of the Company is such that the inhabitants prefer it to the
extreme hardships they had to undergo under the Wannia chiefs, and they
would kill them if not for fear of the power of the Company.Therefore
I think it unnecessary to have any apprehension on this score.Rice and nely are the two articles which are always wanting,
not only in Jaffnapatam, but throughout Ceylon all over the Company's
territory, and therefore the officers of the Government must constantly
guard against a monopoly being made of this grain.This opportunity
is taken to recommend the matter to Your Honours as regards this
Commandement.I do not consider any remarks necessary with regard to the
native trade.I agree, however, with the method practised by
Mr.Zwaardecroon in order to prevent the monopoly of grain, viz.,
that all vessels returning with grain, which the owners take to Point
Pedro, Tellemanaar, and Wallewitteture, often under false pretexts,
in order to hide it there, should be ordered to sail to Kayts.This
matter is recommended to Your Honours' attention.With regard to the coconut trees, we find that more difficulties
are raised about the order from Colombo of October 13 last, for the
delivery of 24 casks of coconut oil, than is necessary, considering
the large number of trees found in this country.It seems to me that
this could be easily done; because, according to what is published from
time to time, and from what is stated in the Pass Book, it appears that
during the period of five years 1692 to 1696 inclusive, a number of
5,397,800 of these nuts were exported, besides the quantity smuggled
and the number consumed within this Commandement.Calculating that
one cask, or 400 cans of 10 quarterns, of oil can be easily drawn from
5,700 coconuts (that is to say, in Colombo: in this Commandement 6,670
nuts would be required for the same quantity, and thus, for the whole
supply of 24 casks, 160,080 nuts would be necessary), I must say I do
not understand why this order should be considered so unreasonable,
and why the Company's subjects could not supply this quantity for
good payment.Instead of issuing licenses for the export of the nuts
it will be necessary to prohibit it, because none of either of the
kinds of oil demanded has been delivered.I do not wish to express
my opinion here, but will only state that shortly after my arrival,
I found that the inhabitants on their own account gladly delivered the
oil at the Company's stores at the rate of 3 fanams or Rd.1/4 per
marcal of 36 quarterns, even up to 14 casks, and since then, again,
10 casks have been delivered, and they still continue to do so.They
also delivered 3 amen of margosa oil, while the Political Council
were bold enough to assert in their letter of April 4 last that it
was absolutely impossible to send either of the two kinds of oil,
the excuse being that they had not even sufficient for their own
requirements.How far this statement can be relied upon I will not
discuss here; but I recommend to Your Honours to be more truthful
and energetic in future, and not to trouble us with unnecessary
correspondence, as was done lately; although so long as the Dessave
is present I have better expectations.No remarks are necessary on the subject of the iron and steel
tools, except that there is the more reason why what is recommended
here must be observed; because the free trade with Coromandel and
Palecatte has been opened this year by order of the Honourable the
Supreme Government of India.It is very desirable that the palmyra planks and laths should
be purchased by the Dessave.As reference is made here to the large
demand for Colombo and Negapatam, I cannot refrain from remarking
that the demand from Negapatam has been taken much more notice of
than that from Colombo; because, within a period of four years, no
more than 1,970 planks and 19,652 laths have been sent here, which was
by no means sufficient, and in consequence other and far less durable
wood had to be used.We also had to obtain laths from private persons
at Jaffnapatam at a high rate and of inferior quality.I therefore
specially request that during the next northern monsoon the following
are sent to this Commandement of Colombo, [72] where several necessary
building operations are to be undertaken:--4,000 palmyra planks in
two kinds, viz., 2,000 planks, four out of one tree; 2,000 planks,
three out of one tree; 20,000 palmyra laths.Your Honour must see that
this timber is sent to Colombo by any opportunity that offers itself.It will be necessary to train another able person for the
supervision of the felling of timber, so that we may not be put to
any inconvenience in case of the death of the old sergeant.Such
a person must be well acquainted with the country and the forests,
and the advice here given must be followed.Charcoal, which is burnt from kernels, has been mentioned under
the heading of the Oely service, where it is stated who are bound
to deliver it.These persons must be kept up to the mark, but as
a substitute in times of necessity 12 hoeden [73] of coals were
sent last January as promised to Your Honour.This must, however,
be economically used.As stated here, the bark-lunt is more a matter of convenience
than of importance.It is, however, necessary to continue exacting
this duty, being an old right of the lord of the land; but on the
other hand it must be seen that too much is not extorted.The coral stone is a great convenience, and it would be well
if it could be found in more places in Ceylon, when so many hoekers
would not be required to bring the lime from Tutucorin.The lime found here is also a great convenience and profit,
as that which is required in this Commandement is obtained free of
cost.When no more lime is required for Coromandel, the 8,000 or 9,000
paras from Cangature must be taken to Kayts as soon as possible in
payment of what the lime-burners still owe.If it can be proved that
any amount is still due, they must return it in cash, as proposed
by Commandeur Zwaardecroon, which Your Honour is to see to.But as
another order has come from His Excellency the Governor of Coromandel
for 100 lasts of lime, it will be easier to settle this account.The dye-roots have been so amply treated of here and in such a way
that I recommend to Your Honour to follow the advice given.I would
add some remarks on the subject if want of time did not prevent my
doing so.The farming out of the duties, including those on the import of
foreign cloth of 20 per cent., having increased by Rds.4,056 1/2,
must be continued in the same way.The stamping of native cloth
(included in the lease) must be reduced, from September 1 next, to 20
per cent.The farmers must also be required to pay the monthly term
at the beginning of each month in advance, which must be stipulated
in the lease, so that the Company may not run any risks.There are
prospects of this lease becoming more profitable for the Company in
future, on account of the passage having been opened.With regard to the Trade Accounts, such good advice has been
given here, that I fully approve of it and need not make any further
comments, but only recommend the observance of the rules.The debts due to the Company, amounting to 116,426.11.14 guilders
at the end of February, 1694, were at the departure of Mr.Zwaardecroon
reduced to 16,137.8 guilders.This must no doubt be attributed
to the greater vigilance exercised, in compliance with the orders
from the Honourable the Supreme Government of India by resolution
of 1693.This order still holds good and seems to be still obeyed;
because, since the date of this Memoir, the debt has been reduced to
14,118.11.8 guilders.The account at present is as follows:--


                                                     Guilders.[74]
    The Province of Timmoraatsche                    376.2.8
    The Province of Patchelepalle                    579.10.0
    Tandua Moeti and Nagachitty (weavers)          2,448.13.0
    Manuel of Anecotta                             8,539.6.0
    The Tannecares caste                           1,650.0.0
    Don Philip Nellamapane                           375.0.0
    Ambelewanner                                     150.0.0
                                                  ===========
                                      Total       14,118.11.8


Herein is not included the Fl.167.15 which again has been paid to
the weavers Tandua Moeti and Naga Chitty on account of the Company for
the delivery of Salampoeris, while materials have been issued to them
later on.It is not with my approval that these poor people continue
to be employed in the weaving of cloth, because the Salampoeris which I
have seen is so inferior a quality and uneven that I doubt whether the
Company will make any profit on it; especially if the people should
get into arrears again as usual on account of the thread and cash
issued to them.I have an idea that I read in one of the letters from
Batavia, which, however, is not to be found here at the Secretariate,
that Their Excellencies forbid the making of the gingams spoken of
by Mr.Zwaardecroon, as there was no profit to be made on these,
but I am not quite sure, and will look for the letter in Colombo,
and inform Their Excellencies at Batavia of this matter.Meantime,
Your Honours must continue the old practice as long as it does not
act prejudicially to the Company.At present their debt is 2,448.13
guilders, from which I think it would be best to discharge them,
and no advance should be given to them in future, nor should they be
employed in the weaving of cloth for the Company.I do not think they
need be sent out of the country on account of their idolatry on their
being discharged from their debt; because I am sure that most of the
natives who have been baptized are more heathen than Christian, which
would be proved on proper investigation.Besides, there are still so
many other heathen, as, for instance, the Brahmin Timmerza and his
large number of followers, about whom nothing is said, and who also
openly practise idolatry and greatly exercise their influence to aid
the vagabonds (land-loopers) dependent on him, much to the prejudice of
Christianity.I think, therefore, that it is a matter of indifference
whether these people remain or not, the more so as the inhabitants of
Jaffnapatam are known to be a perverse and stiff-necked generation,
for whom we can only pray that God in His mercy will graciously
enlighten their understanding and bless the means employed for their
instruction to their conversion and knowledge of their salvation.It is to be hoped that the debt of the dyers, amounting to 8,539.6
guilders, may yet be recovered by vigilance according to the
instructions.The debt of the Tannekares, who owe 1,650 guilders for 11
elephants, and the amount of 375 guilders due by Don Gaspar advanced
to him for the purchase of nely, as also the amount of Fl.150 from
the Ambelewanne, must be collected as directed here.With regard to the pay books nothing need be observed here but
that the instructions given in the annexed Memoir be carried out.What is said here with regard to the Secretariate must be observed,
but with regard to the proposed means of lessening the duties of
the Secretary by transferring the duties of the Treasurer to the
Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho (in which work the latter is already
employed), I do not know whether it would be worth while, as it is
best to make as few changes as possible.The instructions with regard
to the passports must be followed pending further orders.I will not comment upon what is stated here with regard to the
Court of Justice, as these things occurred before I took up the reins
of Government, and that was only recently.I have besides no sufficient
knowledge of the subject, while also time does not permit me to peruse
the documents referred to.Zwaardecroon's advice must be followed,
but in case Mr.Bolscho should have to be absent for a short time
(which at present is not necessary, as it seems that the preparation
of the maps and the correction of the Thombo is chiefly left to the
surveyors), I do not think the sittings of the Court need be suspended,
but every effort must be made to do justice as quickly as possible.In
case of illness of some of the members, or when the Lieutenant Claas
Isaacsz has to go to the interior to relieve the Dessave of his duties
there, Lieut.van Loeveningen, and, if necessary, the Secretary of the
Political Council, could be appointed for the time; because the time
of the Dessave will be taken up with the supervision of the usual work
at the Castle.I think that there are several law books in stock in
Colombo, of which some will be sent for the use of the Court of Justice
by the first opportunity; as it appears that different decisions have
been made in similar cases among the natives.Great precaution must
be observed, and the documents occasionally submitted to us.I think
that the number of five Lascoreens and six Caffirs will be sufficient
for the assistance of the Fiscaal.I will not make any remarks here on the subject of religion, but
will refer to my annotations under the heading of Outstanding Debts.I agree with all that has been stated here with regard to the
Seminary and need not add anything further, except that I think this
large school and church require a bell, which may be rung on Sundays
for the services and every day to call the children to school and
to meals.As there are bells in store, the Dessave must be asked to
see that one is put up, either at the entrance of the church on some
steps, or a little more removed from the door, or wherever it may be
considered to be most convenient and useful.All that is said here with regard to the Consistory I can only
confirm.I approve of the advice given to the Dessave to see to the
improvement of the churches and the houses belonging thereto; but I
have heard that the neglect has extended over a long period and the
decay is very serious.It should have been the duty of the Commandeur
to prevent their falling into ruin.The Civil or Landraad ought to hold its sittings as stated in the
Memoir.I am very much surprised to find that this Court is hardly
worthy of the name of Court any more, as not a single sitting has been
held or any case heard since March 21, 1696.It appears that these
sittings were not only neglected during the absence of the Commandeur
in Colombo, but even after his return and since his departure for
Mallabaar, and it seems that they were not even thought of until my
arrival here.This shows fine government indeed, considering also
that the election of the double number of members for this College had
twice taken place, the members nominated and the list sent to Colombo
without a single meeting being held.It seems to me incomprehensible,
and as it is necessary that this Court should meet again once every
week without fail, the Dessave, as chief in this Commandement when the
Commandeur is absent, is entrusted with the duty of seeing that this
order is strictly observed.As Your Honours are aware, I set apart a
meeting place both for this Court as well as the Court of Justice,
namely, the corner house next to the house of the Administrateur
Biermans, consisting of one large and one small room, while a roof has
been built over the steps.This, though not of much pretension, will
quite do, and I consider it unnecessary to build so large a building as
proposed either for this Court or for the Scholarchen.The scholarchial
meetings can be held in the same place as those of the Consistory,
as is done in Colombo and elsewhere, and a large Consistory has been
built already for the new church.As it is not necessary now to put up
a special building for those assemblies, I need not point out here the
errors in the plan proposed, nor need I state how I think such a place
should be arranged.I have also been averse to such a building being
erected so far outside the Castle and in a corner where no one comes
or passes, and I consider it much better if this is done within the
Castle.There is a large square adjoining the church, where a whole
row of buildings might be put up.It is true that no one may erect
new buildings on behalf of the Company without authority and special
orders from Batavia.I have to recommend that this order be strictly
observed.Whether or not the said foul pool should be filled up I
cannot say at present, as it would involve no little labour to do so.I approve of the advice given in the annexed Memoir with regard
to the Orphan Chamber.I agree with this passage concerning the Commissioners of Marriage
Causes, except that some one else must be appointed in the place of
Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz if necessary.Superintendent of the Fire Brigade and Wardens of the Town.As stated here, the deacons have a deficit of Rds.1,145.3.7 over
the last five and half years, caused by the building of an Orphanage
and the maintenance of the children.At present there are 18 orphans,
10 boys and 8 girls, and for such a small number certainly a large
building and great expenditure is unnecessary.As the deficit has been
chiefly caused by the building of the Orphanage, which is paid for
now, and as the Deaconate has invested a large capital, amounting to
Fl.40,800, on interest in the Company, I do not see the necessity of
finding it some other source of income, as it would have to be levied
from the inhabitants or paid by the Company in some way or other.No more sums on interest are to be received in deposit on behalf
of the Company, in compliance with the instructions referred to.What is stated here with regard to the money drafts must be
observed.Golden Pagodas.--I find a notice, bearing date November 18,
1695, giving warning against the introduction of Pagodas into this
country.It does not seem to have had much effect, as there seems
to be a regular conspiracy and monopoly among the chetties and other
rogues.This ought to be stopped, and I have therefore ordered that
none but the Negapatam and Palliacatte Pagodas will be current at 24
fannums or Rds.2, while it will be strictly prohibited to give in
payment or exchange any other Pagodas, whether at the boutiques or
anywhere else, directly or indirectly, on penalty of the punishment
laid down in the statutes.Your Honours must see that this rule
is observed, and care must be taken that no payment is made to the
Company's servants in coin on which they would have to lose.The applications from outstations.--The rules laid down in the
annexed Memoir must be observed.With regard to the Company's sloops and other vessels, directions
are given here as to how they are employed, which directions must be
still observed.Further information or instructions may be obtained
from Colombo.The Fortifications.--I think it would be preferable to leave the
fortifications of the Castle of Jaffnapatam as they are, instead
of raising any points or curtains.But improvements may be made,
such as the alteration of the embrazures, which are at present on the
outside surrounded by coral stone and chunam, and are not effective,
as I noticed that at the firing of the salute on my arrival, wherever
the canons were fired the coral stone had been loosened and in some
places even thrown down.The sentry boxes also on the outer points
of the flank and face had been damaged.These embrazures would be
very dangerous for the sentry in case of an attack, as they would
not stand much firing.I think also that the stone flooring for the
artillery ought to be raised a little, or, in an emergency, boards
could be placed underneath the canon, which would also prevent the
stones being crushed by the wheels.I noticed further that each canon
stands on a separate platform, which is on a level with the floor of
the curtain, so that if the carriage should break when the canon are
fired, the latter would be thrown down, and it would be with great
difficulty only that they could be replaced on their platform.It
would be much safer if the spaces between these platforms were filled
up.The ramparts are all right, but the curtain <DW72>s too much;
this was done most likely with a view of permitting the shooting with
muskets at even a closer range than half-way across the moat.This
deficiency might be rectified by raising the earthen wall about
half a foot.These are the chief deficiencies I noticed, which could
be easily rectified.With regard to the embrazures, I do not know at
present whether it would be safer to follow the plan of the Commandeur
or that of the Constable-Major Toorse.For the present I have ordered
the removal of the stones and their replacement by grass sods, which
can be fixed on the earthen covering of the ramparts.Some of the
soldiers well experienced in this work are employed in doing this,
and I think that it will be far more satisfactory than the former plan,
which was only for show.The sentry boxes had better be built inside,
and the present passage to them from the earthen wall closed up, and
they must be built so that they would not be damaged by the firing of
the canon.The Dessave has been instructed to see that the different
platforms for the artillery are made on one continuous floor, which
can be easily done, as the spaces between them are but very small
and the materials are at hand.I wish the deficiencies outside the fort could be remedied as well
as those within it.The principal defect is that the moat serves as
yet very little as a safeguard, and it seems as if there is no hope
of its being possible to dig it sufficiently deep, considering that
experiments have been made with large numbers of labourers and yet the
work has advanced but little.When His Excellency the Honourable the
Commissioner van Mydregt was in Jaffnapatam in 1690, he had this work
continued for four or five weeks by a large number of people, but he
had to give it up, and left no instructions as far as is known.The
chief difficulty is the very hard and large rocks enclosed in the
coral stone, which cannot be broken by any instrument and have to
be blasted.This could be successfully done in the upper part, but
lower down beneath the water level the gunpowder cannot be made to
take fire.As this is such an important work, I think orders should
be obtained from Batavia to carry on this work during the dry season
when the water is lowest; because at that time also the people are
not engaged in the cultivation of fields, so that a large number
of labourers could be obtained.The blasting of the rocks was not
undertaken at first for fear of damage to the fortifications, but
as the moat has been dug at a distance of 10 roods from the wall,
it may be 6 or 7 roods wide and a space would yet remain of 3 or
4 roods.This, in my opinion, would be the only effectual way of
completing the work, provision being made against the rushing in of the
water, while a sufficient number of tools, such as shovels, spades,
&c., must be kept at hand for the breaking of the coral stones.It
would be well for the maintenance of the proper depth to cover both
the outer and inner walls with coral stone, as otherwise this work
would be perfectly useless.With regard to the high grounds northward and southward of the town,
this is not very considerable, and thus not a source of much danger.I
admit, however, that it would be better if they were somewhat lower,
but the surface is so large that I fear it would involve a great
deal of labour and expenditure.In case this were necessary, it would
be just as important that the whole row of buildings right opposite
the fort in the town should be broken down.I do not see the great
necessity for either, while moreover, the soil consists of sand and
stone, which is not easily dug.With regard to the horse stables and
the carpenters' yard just outside the gate of the Castle, enclosed
by a wall, the river, and the moat of the Castle, which is deepest
in that place (although I did not see much water in it), I think it
would have been better if they had been placed elsewhere; but yet I
do not think they are very dangerous to the fort, especially as that
corner can be protected from the points Hollandia and Gelria; while,
moreover, the roof of the stable and the walls towards the fort could
be broken down on the approach of an enemy; for, surely no one could
come near without being observed.As these buildings have been only
newly erected, they will have to be used, in compliance with the
orders from Batavia.Thus far as to my advice with regard to this fort; but I do not mean to
oppose the proposals of the Commandeur.I will only state here that I
found the moat of unequal breadth, and in some places only half as wide
as it ought to be, of which no mention is made here.In some places
also it is not sufficiently deep to turn the water by banks or keep it
four or five feet high by water-mills.Even if this were so, I do not
think the water could be retained on account of the sandy and stony
soil, especially as there are several low levels near by.Supposing
even that it were possible, the first thing an enemy would do would be
to direct a few shots of the canon towards the sluices, and thus make
them useless.I would therefore recommend that, if possible, the moat
be deepened so far during the south-west monsoon that it would be on a
level with the river, by which four or six feet of water would always
stand in it.With regard to the sowing of thorns, I fear that during
the dry season they would be quite parched and easily take fire.This
proposal shows how little the work at the moat has really advanced,
in fact, when I saw it it was dry and overgrown with grass.So long
as the fort is not surrounded by a moat, I cannot see the necessity
for a drawbridge, but the Honourable the Government of India will
dispose of this matter.Meantime I have had many improvements made,
which I hope will gain the approval of Their Excellencies.The fortress Hammenhiel is very well situated for the protection
of the harbour and the river of Kaits.The sand bank and the wall
damaged by the storm have been repaired.The height of the reservoir
is undoubtedly a mistake, which must be altered.The gate and the part
of the rampart are still covered with the old and decayed beams, and
it would be well if the project of Mr.This is a
very necessary work, which must be hurried on as much as circumstances
permit, and it is recommended to Your Honours' attention, because
the old roof threatens to break down.As I have not seen any of these places, I cannot say whether the
water tanks are required or not.As the work has to wait for Dutch
bricks, it will be some time before it can be commenced, because
there are none in store here.Manaar is a fortress with four entire bastions.I found that the
full garrison, including Europeans and Mixties, [75] consists of 44
men, twelve or fifteen of whom are moreover usually employed in the
advanced guard or elsewhere.I do not therefore see the use of this
fortress, and do not understand why instead of this fortress a redoubt
was not built.Having been built the matter cannot now be altered.It
has been stated that Manaar is an island which protects Jaffnapatam
on the south, but I cannot see how this is so.The deepening of
the moat cannot be carried out so soon, but the elevations may be
removed.Lime I consider can be burnt there in sufficient quantities,
and my verbal orders to the Resident have been to that effect.The
pavement for the canons I found quite completed, but the floors of
the galleries of the dwelling houses not yet.The water reservoir
of brick, which is on a level with the rampart, I have ordered to be
surrounded with a low wall, about 3 or 3 1/2 feet high, with a view
to prevent accidents to the sentinels at night, which are otherwise
likely to occur.The Dessave must see whether this has been done,
as it is not likely that I would go there again, because I intend
returning to Colombo by another route.Great attention should be paid to the provisions and
ammunition.The order of His Excellency van Mydregt was given as a
wise precaution, but has proved impracticable after many years of
experience, as His Excellency himself was also aware, especially
with regard to grain and rice, on account of the variable crops to
which we are subject here.However, the plan must be carried out as
far as possible in this Commandement, with the understanding that
no extraordinary prices are paid for the purchase of rice; while, on
the other hand, care must be taken that the grain does not spoil by
being kept too long; because we do not know of any kind of rice except
that from Coromandel which can be kept even for one year.At present
rice and nely are easily obtained, and therefore I do not consider it
necessary that the people of Jaffnapatam should be obliged to deliver
their rice at half per cent.The ten kegs of meat
and ten kegs of bacon must be sent to Colombo by the first opportunity,
to be disposed of there, if it is not spoilt (which is very much to
be feared).In case it is unfit for use the loss will be charged to
the account of this Commandement, although it has to be borne by the
Company all the same.Greater discrimination should be exercised in
future to prevent such occurrences, and I think it would be well in
emergencies to follow the advice of the late Mr.Paviljoen, viz., to
capture 1,000 or 1,200 cattle around the fort and drive them inside it,
while dry burs, &c., may also be collected to feed them.The arrack
must never be accepted until it has been proved to be good.In Batavia
it is tested by burning it in a silver bowl, and the same ought to be
done here, it being tested by two Commissioners and the dispenser.In
future bad arrack will be charged to the account of the person who
accepted it.The acceptance of inferior goods proves great negligence,
to say the least, and Your Honours are recommended to see that these
orders are observed.It is a satisfaction to know that there is a
sufficient stock of ammunition.An attempt must be made to repair
the old muskets, and those which are unfit for use must be sent to
Colombo.The storing away of fuel is a
praiseworthy precaution; but on my arrival I found only very little
kept here, and the space for the greater part empty.The military and the garrison are proportionately as strong here as
in other places, the want of men being a general complaint.However,
in order to meet this defect in some way, 34 of the military men who
came here with me are to remain, and also the three men whom I left
at Manaar and appointed to that station.I therefore do not think it
necessary to employ any more oepasses, [76] especially as we intend to
reduce the number of these people in Colombo to a great extent, so that
if they are really required, which I cannot see yet, some of them might
be sent here.At present we have nothing to fear from the Sinhalese.We
are on good terms with them, and it would be inexcusable to employ
any new men whose maintenance would be a heavy expenditure.Strict
discipline and continual military drill are very important points,
specially recommended to the attention of the Dessave.Public Works.--Care must be taken that no more native artisans
are employed than is necessary, as this means a considerable daily
expenditure.The various recommendations on this subject must be
observed.The four old and decayed Portuguese houses, which I found
to be in a bad condition, must be rebuilt when circumstances permit,
and may then serve as dwellings for the clergy and other qualified
officers, [77] but orders from Batavia must be awaited.Meantime
I authorize Your Honours to have the armoury rebuilt, as this is
indispensable.I agree with the recommendations with regard to the horse stables,
and also think that they could very well be supervised by the Chief,
and that it is undesirable for private overseers to be employed
for this purpose.The stable outside the fort has been brought into
readiness, and it may now be considered for what purpose the stable
in the Castle could be utilized.It is well that the floor of the hospital has been raised,
but the floor of the back gallery is also too low, so that it is
always wet whenever it rains, the water both rising from the ground
and coming down from the roof, which has been built too flat.It is
also necessary that a door be made in the ante-room and the entrance
of the gallery, in order to shut out the cold north winds, which are
very strong here and cause great discomfort to the patients.I also
think that the half walls between the rooms should be raised by a half
stone wall up to the roof, because it is too cold as it is at present
for such people.These and other improvements are also recommended
to the attention of the Dessave.It is always the case with the Company's slaves, to ask for
higher pay as soon as they learn a trade.I cannot countenance this
on my part, because I consider that they already receive the highest
pay allowed for a slave.They deserve no more than others who have
to do the heaviest and dirtiest work.These also if put to the test
would do higher work, as experience has proved.It is true that the
number here is small, but I think the rules should be the same in
all places.As there are, however, some slaves in Colombo also who
receive higher pay, the wages of the man who draws 6 fanams might be
raised to 8, 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 fanams, on the understanding that no
increase will be given hereafter.The emancipation of slaves and the
intermarrying with free people has also been practised and tolerated
in Ceylon, but whatever may be the pretext, I think it is always
to the prejudice of the Company in the case of male slaves.In the
case of women without children the matter is not quite so important,
and I would consent to it in the present case of the woman whom a
native proposes to marry, provided she has no children and is willing
to place a strong and healthy substitute.Until further orders no
more slaves are to be emancipated or allowed to intermarry with
free people.Those who are no longer able to work must be excused,
but those who have been receiving higher pay because they know some
trade will, in that case, receive no more than ordinary slaves.It
is not wise to emancipate slaves because they are old, as it might
have undesirable consequences, while also they might in that case
very soon have to be maintained by the Deaconate.It is in compliance with our orders that close regard should
be paid to all that passes at Manaar.This has been confirmed again
by our letter of June 1, especially with a view to collect the duty
from the vessels carrying cloth, areca-nut, &c., as was always done
by the Portuguese, and formerly also by the Company during the time
of the free trade.Further orders with regard to this matter must be
awaited from Batavia.Meantime our provisional orders must be observed,
and in case these are approved, it will have to be considered whether
it would not be better to lease the Customs duty.Personally I think
that this would be decidedly more profitable to the Company.With regard to the ill-fated elephants, I have to seriously
recommend better supervision.It is unaccountable how so many of
these animals should die in the stables.Out of three or four animals
sent to Jaffnapatam in 1685, and once even out of ten animals sent,
only one reached the Castle alive.If such be the case, what use is
it to the Company for efforts to be made for the delivery of a large
number of elephants?Moreover, experience proves that this need not
be looked upon as inevitable, because out of more than 100 elephants
kept in the lands of Matura hardly two or three died in a whole year,
while two parties of 63 animals each had been transported for more than
120 miles by land and reached their destination quite fresh and well,
although there were among these six old and decrepit and thirteen baby
elephants, some only 3 cubits high and rather delicate.It is true, as
has been said, that the former animals had been captured with nooses,
which would tire and harm them more than if they were caught in kraals,
but even then they make every effort to regain their liberty, and,
moreover, the kraals were in use here also formerly, and even then
a large number of the animals died.These are only vain excuses,
for I have been assured by the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz and others
who have often assisted in the capture of elephants, both with nooses
and in kraals, that these animals (which are very delicate and must
be carefully tended, as they cannot be without food for 24 hours)
were absolutely neglected both in the stables at Manaar and on the
way.An animal of 5 or 6 cubits high is fed and attended there by only
one cooly, while each animal requires at least three coolies.They
are only fed on grass, if it is to be had, and at most 10, 12, or
15 olas or coconut leaves, whereas they require at least 50 or 60,
and it is very likely that those that are being transported get still
less, while the journey itself also does them a great deal of harm.How
little regard is paid to these matters I have seen myself in the lands
of Mantotte and elsewhere, and the Chief of Manaar, Willem de Ridder,
when questioned about it, had to admit that none of the keepers or
those who transported the animals, who are usually intemperate and
inexperienced toepas soldiers or Lascoreens, had ever been questioned
or even suspected in this matter.This is neglect of the Company's
interests, and in future only trustworthy persons should be employed,
and fines or corporal punishment ordered in case of failure, as the
death of such a large number of elephants causes considerable loss
to the Company.I think it would be best if the Chief of Manaar were
held mostly responsible for the supervision and after him the Adigar of
Mantotte.They must see that the animals are fed properly when kept in
the stalls during the rainy season; and these animals must always have
more than they eat, as they tread upon and waste part of it.During
the dry season the animals must be distributed over the different
villages in the Island, some also being sent to Carsel.Care must be
taken that besides the cornak [78] there are employed three parrias
[79] for each animal to provide its food, instead of one only as at
present, and besides the Chief and the Adigar a trustworthy man should
be appointed, either a Dutch sergeant or corporal or a reliable native,
to supervise the stalls.His duty will be to improve the stables,
and see that they are kept clean, and that the animals are properly
fed.The tank of Manaar, which is shallow and often polluted by
buffaloes, must be cleaned, deepened, and surrounded with a fence,
and in future only used for the elephants.The Adigar must supervise
the transport of the elephants from Mantotte and Manaar to the Castle,
and he must be given for his assistance all such men as he applies
for.At the boundary of the district of Mantotte he must give over his
charge to the Adigar of Pringaly, and the latter transporting them to
the boundary of Ponneryn must give them over to the Adigar of Ponneryn,
and he again at the Passes to the Ensign there, who will transport them
to the Castle.Experience will prove that in this way nearly all the
animals will arrive in good condition.The Dessave de Bitter is to see
that these orders are carried out, and he may suggest any improvements
he could think of, which will receive our consideration.This is
all I have to say on the subject.It seems that the Castle, &c.,
are mostly kept up on account of the elephants, and therefore the
sale of these animals must counterbalance the expenditure.The cultivation of dye-roots is dealt with under the heading of
the Moorish Trade.I approve the orders from Colombo of May 17, 1695, with regard
to the proposal by Perie Tamby, for I think that he would have looked
for pearl oysters more than for chanks.With regard to the pearl fishery, some changes will have to be
made.The orders will be sent in time from Colombo before the next
fishery.In my Memoir, left at Colombo, I have ordered with regard
to the proposal of the Committee that four buoys should be made as
beacons for the vessels, each having a chain of 12 fathoms long, with
the necessary adaptations in the links for turning.With regard to the
question as to the prohibition of the export of coconuts on account
of the large number of people that will collect there, I cannot see
that it would be necessary.When the time arrives, and it is sure
that a fishery will be held, Your Honours may consider the question
once more, and if you think it to be so, the issue of passports may
be discontinued for the time.Most likely a fishery will be held
in the beginning of next year, upon which we hope God will give His
blessing, the Company having made a profit of Fl.77,435.12 1/2 last
time, when only three-fourths of the work could be done on account
of the early south-west monsoon.All particulars having been stated here with regard to the
inhabited islets, I do not consider it necessary to make any remarks
about them.Horse breeding surely promises good results as stated in the
annexed Memoir.I visited the islands De Twee Gebroeders, and saw
about 200 foals of one, two, and three years old.I had some caught
with nooses, and they proved to be of good build and of fairly
good race.On the island of Delft there are no less than 400 or 500
foals.Many of those on the islands De Twee Gebroeders will soon be
large enough to be captured and trained, when 15 animals, or three
teams, must be sent to Colombo to serve for the carriages with four
horses in which it is customary to receive the Kandyan ambassadors
and courtiers.They must be good animals, and as much as possible
alike in colour.At present we have only ten of these horses, many
of which are too old and others very unruly, so that they are almost
useless.Besides these, 15 riding horses are required for the service
of the Company in Colombo and Galle, as not a single good saddle
horse is to be found in either of these Commandements.Besides these,
25 or 30 horses must be sent for sale to private persons by public
auction, which I trust will fetch a good deal more than Rds.25 or 35,
as they do in Coromandel.The latter prices are the very lowest at
which the animals are to be sold, and none must be sold in private,
but always by public auction.This, I am sure, will be decidedly in the
interest of the Company and the fairest way of dealing.I would further
recommend that, as soon as possible, a stable should be built on the
islands De Twee Gebroeders like that in Delft, or a little smaller,
where the animals could be kept when captured until they are a little
tamed, as they remain very wild for about two months.Next to this
stable a room or small house should be built for the Netherlander to
whom the supervision is entrusted.At present this person, who is
moreover married, lives in a kind of Hottentot's lodging, which is
very unseemly.The Dessave must see that the inhabitants of the island
Delft are forbidden to cultivate cotton, and that the cotton trees now
found there are destroyed; because the number of horses is increasing
rapidly.The Dessave noticed only lately that large tracts of land of
two, three, and more miles are thus cultivated, in direct opposition
to the Company's orders.It seems they are not satisfied to be allowed
to increase the number of their cattle by thousands, all of which have
to derive their food from the island as well as the Company's horses,
but they must also now cultivate cotton, which cannot be tolerated
and must be strictly prohibited.Once the horses perished for want of
water; on one occasion they were shot on account of crooked legs; and
it would be gross carelessness if now they had to perish by starvation.The Passes of Colomboture, Catsjay, Ponneryn, Pyl, Elephant, and
Beschutter; Point Pedro; the Water fortress, Kayts or Hammenhiel;
Aripo; Elipoecareve; and Palwerain-cattoe.No particular remarks
are necessary with regard to these Passes and stations, except that
I would recommend the Dessave, when he has an opportunity to visit
the redoubts Pyl, Elephant, and Beschutter with an expert, to see in
what way they could be best connected.I think that out of all the
different proposals that of a strong and high wall would deserve
preference, if it be possible to collect the required materials,
as it would have to be two miles long.As to the other proposals,
such as that of making a fence of palmyra trees or thorns, or to
dig a moat, I think it would be labour in vain; but whatever is
done must be carried out without expense or trouble to the Company,
in compliance with the orders from the Supreme Government of India.The instructions with regard to the water tanks must be carried
out as far as possible.I agree with what is said here with regard to the public roads.That the elephant stalls and the churches should have been allowed
to fall into decay speaks badly for the way in which those concerned
have performed their duty; and it is a cause of dissatisfaction.The
orders for the stalls in Manaar must also be applied for here,
and repairs carried out as soon as possible.I have been informed
that there are many elephants scattered here and there far from each
other, while only one Vidana acts as chief overseer, so that he cannot
possibly attend to his duty properly.It has been observed that the
elephants should have more parias or men who provide their food.These
and other orders with regard to the animals should be carried out.No remarks are required with regard to this subject of thornback
skins, Amber de gris, Carret, and elephants' tusks.The General Paresse [80] has been held upon my orders on the last
of July.Three requests were made, two of which were so frivolous and
unimportant that I need not mention them here.The
third and more important one was that the duty on native cloth,
which at present is 25 per cent., might be reduced.It was agreed
that from the 31st December it would be only 20 per cent.I was in a
position to settle this matter at once, because orders had been already
received from Batavia that they could be reduced to 20 per cent.,
but no more.As shown in the annexed Memoir, the inhabitants are not
so badly off as they try to make us believe.The further instructions
in the annexed Memoir must be observed; and although I have verbally
ordered the Onderkoopman De Bitter to have the Pattangatyns appear
only twice instead of twelve times a year, as being an unbearable
inconvenience, the Dessave must see that this order is obeyed.He must
also make inquiries whether the work could be done by one Cannekappul,
and, if so, Jeronimus must be discharged.Conclusion.--The advice in this conclusion may be useful to Your
Honours.I confirm the list of members of the Political Council,
to whom the rule of this Commandement in the interest of the Company
is seriously recommended.Reports of all transactions must be sent
to Colombo.A.--No remarks are necessary in regard to the introduction.B.--In elucidation of the document sent by us with regard to the
opening of the harbours of the Kandyan King, as to how far the
instructions extend and how they are to be applied within the Company's
jurisdiction, nothing need be said here, as this will be sufficiently
clear from our successive letters from Colombo.We would only state
that it would seem as if Mr.Zwaardecroon had forgotten that the
prohibition against the clandestine export of cinnamon applies also
to the export of elephants, and that these may not be sold either
directly or indirectly by any one but the Company.C.--It is not apparent that our people would be allowed to
purchase areca-nut in Trincomalee on account of the opening of
the harbours.Zwaardecroon's plan has been submitted to Their
Excellencies at Batavia, who replied in their letters of December 12,
1695, and July 3, 1696, that some success might be obtained by getting
the nuts through the Wanny from the King's territory.An experiment
might be made (provided Their Excellencies approve) charging Rds.1/3
per ammunam, as is done in Colombo, Galle, Matura, &c. This toll could
be farmed out, and the farmers authorized to collect the duty at the
passes, no further duties being imposed whether the nuts are exported
or not.If the duty were levied only on the nuts that are exported,
the inhabitants who now buy them from the Company at Rds.6 per ammunam
would no longer do so, and this profit would be lost.Whether the
duty ought to be higher than Rds.The same
rule must be applied to pepper, cotton, &c., imported at the passes,
7 1/2 per cent.[81] This being paid,
the articles may be sold here, exported, or anything done as the
inhabitants please, without further liability to duty.D.--In the proclamation referred to here, in which free trade is
permitted at all harbours in Ceylon in the Company's territory,
it is clearly stated that the harbours may be freely entered with
merchandise, provided the customary duties are paid, and that only
the subjects of the Kandyan King are exempted from the payment of
these.It does not seem to me that this rule is in agreement with
the supposition that because of this free trade the duty on foreign
and native cloth would be abolished.Zwaardecroon had made
inquiries he would have been informed that, as far as the import of
foreign cloth is concerned, the duty is the same as that in Colombo and
Galle.The proposed change would apparently bring about an increase of
the alphandigo, but where then would be found the Rds.7,1 0 as duty
on the native and foreign cloths?I cannot see on what basis this
proposal is founded, and I therefore think that the Customs duty of
20 per cent.on the imported foreign cloths and the 20 per cent.for
the stamping of native cloths must be continued when, on the 31st
December next, the lease for the duty of 25 per cent.expires, the
more so as it has been pointed out in this Memoir wherever possible
that the inhabitants are increasing in prosperity.This agrees with
what was discussed at the general Paresse.With regard to the Moorish
merchants from Bengal, there would be no objection to the duty on the
cloths imported by them being fixed at 7 1/2 per cent., because they
have to make a much longer voyage than the merchants from Coromandel
and other places on the opposite coast; while we have to humour them
in order to induce them to provide us with rice.Moreover the Bengal
cloths are not very much in demand, and these people usually ask to
be paid in elephants, which do not cost the Company very much, rather
than in cash, as has been done again by the owner of the ship that is
here at present on behalf of the Bengal Nabob Caungaarekan.He also
complained of the duty of 20 per cent.and said he would pay no more
than the Company pays in Bengal.He said his master the Nabob would
be very angry, &c. We therefore considered whether the duty could not
be reduced to 7 1/2 per cent., as may be seen in the resolutions of
June 4 last.On December 12, 1695, a letter was received from Batavia
in answer to the difficulties raised by Mr.Zwaardecroon with regard
to these impositions, in which it is said that the Customs duty for
Bengal from the date of the license for free trade should be regulated
as it had been in olden times, with authority to remove difficulties
in their way and to give them redress where necessary.I found that
the duty paid by them formerly on these cloths was 7 1/2 per cent.,
both in Galle and here, and I therefore authorize Your Honours to
levy from them only that amount.This must be kept in mind at the
farming out of these revenues at the end of the year, in order to
prevent difficulties with the farmer, as happened only lately.I
trust, however, that the farming out will not yield less than other
years.Meantime, and before any other vessels from Bengal arrive, the
approbation of Their Excellencies at Batavia must be obtained with
regard to this matter, so that alterations may be made according to
their directions without any difficulty.E.--I must confess that I do not understand how the subject of
free trade can be brought forward again as being opposed to the
Company's interests, as is done again with regard to the 24 casks
of coconut oil which the inhabitants have to deliver to the Company,
which are properly paid for and are not required for the purpose of
sale but for the use of the Company's servants, or how any one dares
to maintain that the lawful sovereign who extends his graciousness
and favours over his subjects and neighbours would be tied down and
prejudiced by such rules.It is true that the coconut trees in Matura
are required for the elephants, but in Galle and Colombo it is not so;
but the largest number of trees there is utilized for the drawing of
surie [82] for arrack, &c. It is true that some nuts are exported,
but only a small quantity, while the purchasers or transporters have
to sell one-third of what they export to the Company at Rds.2 a
thousand, while they must cost them at least Rds.Out of these we
had the oil pressed ourselves, and this went largely to supplement
the requirements for local consumption, which are very large, since
the vessels also have to be supplied, because as a matter of economy
the native harpuis (resin) has been largely used for rubbing over
the ships, so as to save the Dutch resin as much as possible, and
for the manufacture of this native resin a large quantity of oil is
required.Your Honours must therefore continue to have all suitable
casks filled with oil, and send to Colombo all that can be spared
after the required quantity has been sent to Coromandel, Trincomalee,
and Batticaloa, reserving what is necessary for the next pearl fishery
and the use of the Commandement.In order to avoid difficulties, Your
Honours are required to send to Colombo yearly (until we send orders
to the contrary) 12 casks of coconut oil and 2 casks of margosa oil,
which are expected without failure.For the rest we refer to what is
said under the heading of Coconut Trees.F.--This form for a passport was sent for no other purpose but that
it should be introduced according to instructions.G.--There is sufficient time yet for the opening of the road from
Putulang to Mantotte.I am well pleased with the work of the Dessave,
and approve of the orders given by him to the Toepas Adigar Rodrigo,
and the various reports submitted by him.In these he states that the
roads are now in good condition, while on June 5, when 34 elephants
arrived from Colombo, on this side of Putulang nothing had been done
yet, and even on July 16 and 17 when His Excellency the Governor
passed part of that road the work had advanced but very little.I
therefore sent on the 14th instant the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz, who
had successfully transported the animals from Colombo to Putulang,
and is a man who can be depended upon, with two surveyors to see
that the roads, which were narrow and extraordinary crooked, were
widened to 2 roods and straightened somewhat in the forest, and to
cut roads leading to the water tanks.Sixty Wallias or wood-cutters,
150 coolies, and 25 Lascoreens were sent to complete this work, so
that in future there will be no difficulties of this kind, except
that the dry tanks must be deepened.Isaacsz on this
subject on my return.On account of his shameful neglect and lying
and for other well-known reasons I have dismissed the Adigar Domingo
Rodrigo as unworthy to serve the Company again anywhere or at any
time, and have appointed in his place Alexander Anamale, who has
been an Adigar for many years in the same place.In giving him this
appointment I as usual obtained the verbal and written opinions of
several of the Commandeurs, who stated that he had on the whole been
vigilant and diligent in his office, but was discharged last year
by the Commission from Colombo without any reasons being known here,
to make room for the said incapable Domingo Rodrigo, who was Adigar of
Ponneryn at the time.I suppose he was taken away from there to please
the Wannia chiefs Don Philip Nellamapane and Don Gaspar Ilengenarene,
whose eldest son Gaspar, junior, was appointed Master of the Hunt,
as stated under the heading of the Wanny and Ponneryn.With regard to
the instructions to compile various lists, this order must be carried
out in so far as they are now complete.With regard to the significant
statement that the Honourable Company does not possess any lands in
Jaffnapatam, and that there is not the smallest piece of land known
of which the Company does not receive taxes, and that it therefore
would be impossible to compile a list of lands belonging to or given
away on behalf of the Company, and in case of the latter by whom, to
whom, when, why, &c., I am at a loss to follow the reasoning, and it
seems to me that there is something wrong in it, because the protocols
at the Secretariate here show that during the years 1695, 1696, and
1697 five pieces of land were given away by Mr.Zwaardecroon himself,
and this without the least knowledge or consent of His Excellency the
Governor; while, on the other hand, I know that there are still many
fields in the Provinces which are lying waste and have never been
cultivated; so that they belong to the Company and no one else.At
present the inhabitants send their cattle to these lands to graze,
as the animals would otherwise destroy their cultivated fields,
but in the beginning all lands were thus lying waste.With a view
to find out how many more of these lands there are here, and where
they are situated, I have instructed the Thombo-keeper, Mr.Bolscho,
to draw up a list of them from the newly compiled Thombo, beginning
with the two Provinces Willigamme and Waddamoraatschie, the Thombo of
which is completed; the other three Provinces must be taken up later
on.Perhaps the whole thing could be done on one sheet of paper, and
it need not take two years, nor do we want the whole Thombo in several
reams of imperial paper.Bolscho
return from their work at the road to Putulang, this work must be
taken in hand and the list submitted as soon as possible.I also do
not see the difficulty of compiling a list of all the small pieces
of land which, in the compiling of the new Thombo, were discovered on
re-survey to have been unlawfully taken possession of.Since my arrival
here I had two such lists prepared for the Provinces Willigamme and
Waddamoraatschie covering two sheets of paper each.This work was well
worth the trouble, as the pieces of cultivated land in the Province
of Willigamme amounted to 299,977 1/2 and in Waddamoraatschie to
128,013 roods, making altogether 427,990 1/2 roods.These, it is
said, might be sold to the present owners for about Rds.I
think it would be best if these lands were publicly leased out, so
that the people could show their deeds.I think this would not be
unreasonable, and consider it would be sufficient favour to them,
since they have had the use of the lands for so many years without
ever paying taxes.When the new Thombo is compiled for the Provinces
of Patchelepalle and Timmeraatsche and the six inhabited islands,
some lands will surely be discovered there also.H.--It is in compliance with instructions, and with my approbation,
that the accounts with the purchasers of elephants in Golconda and
with the Brahmin Timmerza have been settled.For various reasons which
it is not necessary to state here he is never to be employed as the
Company's broker again, the more so as the old custom of selling the
elephants by public auction has been reintroduced this year, as has
been mentioned in detail under the heading of Trade.Your Honours must comply with our orders contained in the letter
of May 4 last from Colombo, as to how the cheques from Golconda are
to be drawn up and entered in the books.With regard to the special
request of the merchants that the amount due to them might be paid in
cash or elephants through the said Timmerza to their attorneys, this
does not appear in their letter of December 7, 1696, from Golconda,
but the principal purchasers of elephants request that the Company
may assist the people sent by them in the obtaining of vessels, and,
if necessary, give them an advance of 300 or 400 Pagodas, stating
that these had been the only reasons why they had consented to deal
with the said Timmerza.In our letter of May 4 Your Honours have been
informed that His Excellency Laurens Pit, Governor of Coromandel, has
consented at our request to communicate with you whenever necessary, as
the means of the Golconda merchants who desire to obtain advances from
the Company, and how much could be advanced to their attorneys.Such
cases must be carefully dealt with, but up to the present no such
request has been made, which is so much the better.I.--The 20,000 paras or 866 2/3 lasts of nely applied for from
Negapatam will come in useful here, although since the date of this
Memoir or the 6th of June the Council agreed to purchase on behalf
of the Company the 125 1/5 lasts of rice brought here in the Bengal
ship of the Nabob of Kateck Caim Caareham, because even this does
not bring the quantity in store to the 600 lasts which are considered
necessary for Jaffnapatam, as is shown under the heading of provisions
and ammunition.It will be necessary to encourage the people from
Bengal in this trade, as has been repeatedly stated.K.--The petition mentioned here, submitted by the bargemen of the
Company's pontons, stating that they have been made to pay all that
had been lost on various cargoes of rice above one per cent., that they
had not been fairly dealt with in the measuring, &c., deserves serious
investigation.It must be seen to that these people are not made to
refund any loss for which they are not responsible and which they could
not prevent, and the annexed recommendation should be followed as far
as reasonable.The point of the unfair measuring must be especially
attended to, since such conduct would deserve severe correction.L.--The instructions given here with regard to the receipt of Pagodas
must be carried out, but none but Negapatam or Palicatte Pagodas
must be received or circulated.Our instructions under the heading
of Golden Pagodas must be observed.M.--The Dessave de Bitter is to employ the Lieutenant Claas Isaacsz
in the Public Works Department on his return from Putulang after the
transport of the elephants, being a capable man for this work.The most
necessary work must be carried out first.van Keulen and Petitfilz, presented the son of the deceased
Don Philip Sangerepulle with a horse and a sombreer [83] by order
of His Excellency the Governor, apparently because he was the chief
of the highest caste, or on account of his father's services.Much
has been said against the father, but nothing has been proved, and
indeed greater scoundrels might be found on investigation.Zwaardecroon, because no act of authority was shown
to him, has rejected this presentation and ordered the Political
Council here from the yacht "Bekenstyn" on March 29 of this year to
demand back from the youth this horse and sombreer.This having been
done without my knowledge and consent, I countermand this order, and
expect Your Honours to carry out the orders of His late Excellency the
Governor.[84] With regard to the administration of this Commandement,
I have stated what was necessary under the heading of the Form of
Government at the conclusion of the Memoir to which I herewith refer.I
will only add here that since then I have had reason to doubt whether
my instructions with regard to the Political Council and the manner
in which the administration is to be carried out has been properly
understood.I reiterate therefore that the Dessave de Bitter will be
looked upon and respected as the Chief in the Commandement during
the absence of the Commandeur, and that to him is entrusted the
duty of convening the meetings both of the Political Council and of
the Court of Justice.Also that he will pass and sign all orders,
such as those for the Warehouses, the Treasury, the Workshop, the
Arsenal, and other of the Company's effects.Further, that when he
stays over night in the Castle, he is to give out the watch-word and
see to the opening and the closing of the gates, which, in the event
of his absence, is deputed to the Captain.The Dessave will see that
order and discipline are maintained, especially among the military,
and also that they are regularly drilled.He is further to receive
the daily reports, not only of the military but also of all master
workmen, &c.; in short, he is to carry out all work just as if the
Commandeur were present.Recommending thus far and thus briefly these
instructions as a guidance to the Administrateur and the Political
Council, and praying God's blessing--


I remain, Sirs, etc.,

1697.Section of Palace of Thothmes III., Thebes.]When the original line was resumed, Meneptah commenced the building of
the great hall, which he nearly completed.Rameses, the first king of
the 19th dynasty, built the small temple in front; and the so-called
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty added the great court in front,
completing the building to the extent we now find it.We have thus, as
in some of our mediæval cathedrals, in this one temple a complete
history of the style during the whole of its most flourishing period;
and, either for interest or for beauty, it forms such a series as no
other country, and no other age, can produce.Besides those buildings
mentioned above, there are other temples to the north, to the east, and
more especially to the south, and pylons connecting these, and avenues
of sphinxes extending for miles, and enclosing-walls, and tanks, and
embankments—making up such a group as no city ever possessed before or
since.Peter’s, with its colonnades, and the Vatican, make up an
immense mass, but as insignificant in extent as in style when compared
with this glory of ancient Thebes and its surrounding temples.Plan of Hypostyle Hall at Karnac.Section of central portion of Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac.The culminating point and climax of all this group of building is the
hypostyle hall of Meneptah.The plan and section of its central portion
on the next page, both to the usual scale, will explain its general
arrangement; but no language can convey an idea of its beauty, and no
artist has yet been able to reproduce its form so as to convey to those
who have not seen it an idea of its grandeur.The mass of its central
piers, illumined by a flood of light from the clerestory, and the
smaller pillars of the wings gradually fading into obscurity, are so
arranged and lighted as to convey an idea of infinite space; at the same
time, the beauty and massiveness of the forms, and the brilliancy of
their  decorations, all combine to stamp this as the greatest of
man’s architectural works; but such a one as it would be impossible to
reproduce, except in such a climate and in that individual style in
which, and for which, it was created.Caryatide Pillar, from the Great Court at
Medeenet-Habû.]On the same side of the Nile, and probably at one time connected with it
by an avenue of sphinxes, stands the temple of Luxor, hardly inferior in
some respects to its great rival at Karnac; but either it was never
finished, or, owing to its proximity to the Nile, it has been ruined,
and the materials carried away.The length is about 830 ft., its breadth
ranging from 100 to 200 ft.Its general arrangement comprised, first, a
great court at a different angle from the rest, being turned so as to
face Karnac.In front of this stand two colossi of Rameses the Great,
its founder, and two obelisks were once also there, one of which is now
in Paris.Behind this was once a great hypostyle hall, but only the two
central ranges of columns are now standing.Still further back were
smaller halls and numerous apartments, evidently meant for the king’s
residence, rather than for a temple or place exclusively devoted to
worship.The palace at Luxor is further remarkable as a striking instance of how
regardless the Egyptians were of regularity and symmetry in their plans.Not only is there a considerable angle in the direction of the axis of
the building, but the angles of the courtyards are in scarcely any
instance right angles; the pillars are variously spaced, and pains seem
to have been gratuitously taken to make it as irregular as possible in
nearly every respect.All the portion at the southern end was erected by
Amenhotep III., the northern part completed by Rameses the Great, the
same who built the Rameseum already described as situated on the other
bank of the Nile.Besides these there stood on the western side of the Nile the Memnonium,
or great temple of Amenhotep III., now almost entirely ruined.It was
placed on the alluvial plain, within the limits of the inundation, which
has tended on the one hand to bury it, and on the other to facilitate
the removal of its materials.Nearly the only remains of it now apparent
are the two great seated colossi of its founder, one of which, when
broken, became in Greek, or rather Roman times, the vocal Memnon, whose
plaintive wail to the rising sun, over its own and its country’s
desolation, forms so prominent an incident in the Roman accounts of
Thebes.[56]

[Illustration: 25.Section through Hall of Columns, South Temple of
Karnac.Not far from this stands the great temple known as that of
Medeenet-Habû, built by the first king of the 19th dynasty.Its
dimensions are only slightly inferior to those of the Rameseum, being
520 ft.from front to rear, and its propylon 107 ft.Its two great
courts are, however, inferior in size to those of that building.The
inner one is adorned by a series of Caryatide figures (Woodcut No.24),
which are inferior both in conception and execution to those of the
previous reigns; and indeed throughout the whole building there is an
absence of style, and an exaggeration of detail, which shows only too
clearly that the great age was passing away when it was erected.The
roof of its hypostyle hall, and of the chambers beyond it, is occupied
by an Arab village, which would require to be cleared away before it
could be excavated; much as this might be desired, the details of its
courts would not lead us to expect anything either very beautiful or new
from its disinterment.Further down the river, as already mentioned,
stood another temple, that of Koorneh, built by the same Meneptah who
erected the great hall of Karnac.It is, however, only a fragment, or
what may be called the residential part of a temple.The hypostyle hall
never was erected, and only the foundations of two successive pylons can
be traced in front of it.In its present condition, therefore, it is one
of the least interesting of the temples of Thebes, though elsewhere it
would no doubt be regarded with wonder.Another building of this age, attached to the southern side of the great
temple of Karnac, deserves especial attention as being a perfectly
regular building, erected at one time, and according to the original
design, and strictly a temple, without anything about it that could
justify the supposition of its being a palace.It was erected by the first king of the 19th dynasty, and consists of
two pylons, approached through an avenue of sphinxes.Within this is an
hypæthral court, and beyond that a small hypostyle hall, lighted from
above, as shown in the section (Woodcut No.Within this is the
cell, surrounded by a passage, and with a smaller hall beyond, all
apparently dark, or very imperfectly lighted.The gateway in front of
the avenue was erected by the Ptolemys, and, like many Egyptian
buildings, is placed at a different angle to the direction of the
building itself.Besides its intrinsic beauty, this temple is
interesting as being far more like the temples erected afterwards under
the Greek and Roman domination than anything else belonging to that
early age.At Tanis, or Zoan, near the mouth of the Nile, the remains of a temple
and of 13 obelisks can still be traced.At Soleb, on the borders of
Nubia, a temple now stands of the Third Amenhotep, scarcely inferior in
beauty or magnificence to those of the capital.At Sedinga, not far below the third cataract, are the remains of temples
erected by Amenhotep III.of the 18th dynasty, which are interesting as
introducing in a completed form a class of pillar that afterwards became
a great favourite with Egyptian architects (Woodcut No.Before this
time we find these Isis heads either painted or carved on the face of
square piers, but so as not to interfere with the lines of the pillars.Gradually they became more important, so as to form a double capital, as
in this instance.In the Roman times, as at Denderah (Woodcut No.143), all the four faces of the pier were so adorned, though it must be
admitted in very questionable taste.It would be tedious to attempt to enumerate without illustrating all the
fragments that remain of temples of this age.Some are so ruined that it
is difficult to make out their plan.Others, like those of Memphis or
Tanis, so entirely destroyed, that only their site, or at most only
their leading dimensions, can be made out.Their loss is of course to be
regretted; but those enumerated above are sufficient to enable us to
judge both of the style and the magnificence of the great building
epoch.At Abydus the remains of two great temples have been found; one of
Rameses II., with great court surrounded by piers with osireide figures
on them; two halls of columns, a sanctuary, and other small chambers in
the rear.The other, completed only and decorated with sculpture by
Rameses II., the temple having been built by his father, Sethi I. This
second temple differs in the arrangement of its plan from other examples
(Woodcut No.29); it was preceded by two great courts; at the further
end of the second court was a peristyle with twelve piers, from which,
through three doors, a hall of twenty-four columns was reached; the
columns here were so arranged as to suggest seven avenues, beyond which
were seven doors leading to a second hall with thirty-six columns,
similarly disposed to those in the first hall.These avenues led to
seven sanctuaries, the roofs of which were segmental, the arched form of
vault being cut out of solid blocks of stone (Woodcut No.Beyond
the sepulchral destination, which roofs of these sanctuaries suggest,
nothing is known from inscriptions as to their precise use.Through one
of the sanctuaries other halls of columns and chambers were reached
which lie in the rear of the building, and on the south side, and
approached from the second great hall of columns, many other halls,
chambers, and staircases leading to the roof.The special interest to
the Egyptologist, however, of this temple lies in the fact that it was
on the walls of one of these that the so-called tablet of Abydus was
discovered—now in the British Museum—which first gave a connected list
of kings, the predecessors of Rameses, and sufficiently extensive to
confirm the lists of Manetho in a manner satisfactory to the ordinary
inquirer.A second list, far more complete, has recently been brought to
light in the same locality, and contains the names of 76 kings,
ancestors of Meneptah, the father of Rameses.It begins, as all lists
do, with Menes; but even this list is only a selection, omitting many
names found in Manetho, but inserting others which are not in his
lists.[57] Before the discovery of this perfect list, the longest known
were that of the chamber of the ancestors of Thothmes III., at Karnac,
containing when perfect 61 names, of which, however, nearly one-third
are obliterated; and that recently found at Saccara, containing 58 names
originally, but of which several are now illegible.It is the existence of these lists which gives such interest and such
reality to the study of Architecture in Egypt.Fortunately there is
hardly a building in that country which is not adorned with the name of
the king in whose reign it was erected.In royal buildings they are
found on every wall and every pillar.The older cartouches are simple
and easily remembered; and when we find the buildings thus dated by the
builders themselves, and their succession recorded by subsequent kings
on the walls of their temples, we feel perfectly certain of our
sequence, and nearly so of the actual dates of the buildings; they are,
moreover, such a series as no other country in the world can match
either for historic interest or Architectural magnificence.ROCK-CUT TOMBS AND TEMPLES.But in Egypt Proper and in Nubia the Egyptians were in the habit of
excavating monuments from the living rock, but with this curious
distinction, that, with scarcely an exception, all the excavations in
Egypt Proper are tombs, and no important example of a rock-cut temple
has yet been discovered.In Nubia, on the other hand, all the
excavations are temples, and no tombs of importance are to be found
anywhere.This distinction may hereafter lead to important historical
deductions, inasmuch as on the western side of India there are an
infinite number of rock-cut temples, but no tombs of any sort.Every
circumstance seems to point to the fact that, if there was any
connection between Africa and India, it was with the provinces in the
upper part of the Valley of the Nile, and not with Egypt Proper.This,
however, is a subject that can hardly be entered on here, though it may
be useful to bear in mind the analogy alluded to.Plan and Section of Rock-cut Temple at Abû Simbel.Like all rock-cut examples all over the world, these Nubian temples are
copies of structural buildings only more or less modified to suit the
exigencies of their situation, which did not admit of any very great
development inside, as light and air could only be introduced from the
one opening of the doorway.The two principal examples of this class of monument are the two at Abû
Simbel, the larger of which is the finest of its class known to exist
anywhere.Its total depth from the face of the rock is 150 ft., divided
into 2 large halls and 3 cells, with passages connecting them.Externally the façade is about 100 ft.in height, and adorned by 4 of
the most magnificent colossi in Egypt, each 70 ft.in height, and
representing the king, Rameses II., who caused the excavation to be
made.It may be because they are more perfect than any others now found
in that country, but certainly nothing can exceed their calm majesty and
beauty, or be more entirely free from the vulgarity and exaggeration
which is generally a characteristic of colossal works of this sort.The smaller temple at the same place has six standing figures of deities
countersunk in the rock, and is carved with exceeding richness.It is of
the same age with the large temple, but will not admit of comparison
with it owing to the inferiority of the design.Besides these, there is a very beautiful though small example at
Kalabsheh (known as the Bayt el Wellee, “the house of the saint”),
likewise belonging to the age of Rameses II., and remarkable for the
beauty of its sculptural bas-reliefs, as well as for the bold
Proto-Doric columns which adorn its vestibule.There are also smaller
ones at Dêrr and Balagne, at the upper end of the valley.At Wâdy Saboua
and Gerf Hussên, the cells of the temple have been excavated from the
rock, but their courts and propylons are structural buildings added in
front—a combination only found once in Egypt, at Thebes (Dêr-el-Bahree),
and very rare anywhere else, although meeting the difficulties of the
case better than any other arrangement, inasmuch as the sanctuary has
thus all the imperishability and mystery of a cave, and the temple at
the same time has the space and external appearance of a building
standing in the open air.This last arrangement is found also as a characteristic of the temples
of Gebel Barkal, in the kingdom of Meroë, showing how far the
rock-cutting practice prevailed in the Upper Valley of the Nile.The plan on which the Temple of Dêr-el-Bahree is constructed is curious,
and differs entirely from that of any other in Egypt.It is built in
stages up a <DW72> at the foot of the mountain, flights of steps leading
from one court to the other.The temple was built by Queen Hatshepsu or
Amen-noo-het, the sister of Thothmes II.and Thothmes III., and
consisted of three courts rising in terraces one above the other; at the
back of these were two ranges of porticoes, the upper one set back
behind the lower and built into the vertical face of the rock with which
the sanctuary and antechambers were cut.As all the temples above
mentioned are contemporary with the great structures in Egypt, it seems
strange that the eternity of a rock-cut example did not recommend this
form of temple to the attention of the Egyptians themselves.But with
the exception of Dêr-el-Bahree and a small grotto, called the Speos
Artemidos, near Beni-Hasan, and two small caves at Silsilis, near the
Cataract, the Egyptians seem never to have attempted it, trusting
apparently to the solidity of their masonic structures for that eternity
of duration they aspired to.In addition to the temples above described, which are all more or less
complex in plan, and all made up of various independent parts, there
exists in Egypt a class of temples called _mammeisi_, dedicated to the
mysterious accouchement of the mother of the gods.Small temples of this
form are common to all ages, and belong as well to the 18th dynasty as
to the time of the Ptolemys.One of them, built by Amenhotep III.at
Elephantine, is represented in plan and elevation in the annexed cut.It
is of a simple peristylar form, with columns in front and rear, the
latter being now built into a wall, and seven square piers on each
flank.These temples are all small, and, like the Typhonia, which
somewhat resemble them, were used as detached chapels or cells,
dependent on the larger temples.What renders them more than usually
interesting to us is the fact that they were undoubtedly the originals
of the Greek peristylar forms, that people having borrowed nearly every
peculiarity of their architecture from the banks of the Nile.We possess
tangible evidence of peristylar temples and Proto-Doric pillars erected
in Egypt centuries before the oldest known specimen in Greece.We need
therefore hardly hesitate to award the palm of invention of these things
to the Egyptians, as we should probably be forced to do for most of the
arts and sciences of the Greeks if we had only knowledge sufficient to
enable us to trace the connecting links which once joined them together,
but which are now in most instances lost, or at least difficult to find.Of the first 10 dynasties of Egyptian kings little now remains but their
tombs—the everlasting pyramids—and of the people they governed, only the
structures and rock-cut excavations which they prepared for their final
resting-places.The Theban kings and their subjects erected no pyramids, and none of
their tombs are structural—all are excavated from the living rock; and
from Beni-Hasan to the Cataract the plain of the Nile is everywhere
fringed with these singular monuments, which, if taken in the aggregate,
perhaps required a greater amount of labour to excavate and to adorn
than did even all the edifices of the plain.Certain it is that there is
far more to be learnt of the arts, of the habits, and of the history of
Egypt from these tombs than from all the other monuments.No tomb of any
Theban king has yet been discovered anterior to the 18th dynasty; but
all the tombs of that and of the subsequent dynasty have been found, or
are known to exist, in the Valley of Bibán-el-Molook, on the western
side of the plain of Thebes.It appears to have been the custom with these kings, so soon as they
ascended the throne, to begin preparing their final resting-place.The
excavation seems to have gone on uninterruptedly year by year, the
painting and adornment being finished as it progressed, till the hand of
death ended the king’s reign, and simultaneously the works of his tomb.All was then left unfinished; the cartoon of the painter and the rough
work of the mason and plasterer were suddenly broken off, as if the hour
of the king’s demise called them, too, irrevocably from their labours.The tomb thus became an index of the length of a king’s reign as well as
of his magnificence.Of those in the Valley of the Kings the most
splendid is that opened by Belzoni, and now known as that of Meneptah,
the builder of the hypostyle hall at Karnac.It descends, in a sloping
direction, for about 350 ft.into the mountain, the upper half of it
being tolerably regular in plan and direction; but after progressing as
far as the unfinished hall with two pillars, the direction changes, and
the works begin again on a lower level, probably because they came in
contact with some other tomb, or in consequence of meeting some flaw in
the rock.It now terminates in a large and splendid chamber with a coved
roof, in which stood, when opened by Belzoni, the rifled
sarcophagus;[58] but a drift-way has been excavated beyond this, as if
it had been intended to carry the tomb still further had the king
continued to reign.Plan and Section of Tomb of Meneptah at Thebes.The tomb of Rameses Maiamoun, the first king of the 19th dynasty, is
more regular, and in some respects as magnificent as this, and that of
Amenhotep III.is also an excavation of great beauty, and is adorned
with paintings of the very best age.Like all the tombs, however, they
depend for their magnificence more on the paintings that cover the walls
than on anything which can strictly be called architecture, so that they
hardly come properly within the scope of the present work: the same may
be said of private tombs.Except those of Beni-Hasan, already
illustrated by Woodcuts Nos.16 to 18, these tombs are all mere chambers
or corridors, without architectural ornament, but their walls are
covered with paintings and hieroglyphics of singular interest and
beauty.Generally speaking, it is assumed that the entrances of these
tombs were meant to be concealed and hidden from the knowledge of the
people after the king’s death.It is hardly conceivable, however, that
so much pains should have been taken, and so much money lavished, on
what was designed never again to testify to the magnificence of its
founder.It is also very unlike the sagacity of the Egyptians to attempt
what was so nearly impossible; for though the entrance of a pyramid
might be so built up as to be unrecognisable, a cutting in the rock can
never be repaired or disguised, and can only be temporarily concealed by
heaping rubbish over it.Supposing it to have been intended to conceal
the entrances, such an expedient was as clumsy and unlikely to have been
resorted to by so ingenious a people as it has proved futile, for all
the royal tombs in the valley of Bibán-el-Molook have been opened and
rifled in a past age, and their sites and numbers were matters of public
notoriety in the times of the Greeks and Romans.Many of the private
tombs have architectural façades, and certainly never were meant to be
concealed, so that it is not fair to assume that hiding their tombs’
entrances was ever a peculiarity of the Thebans, though it certainly was
of the earlier Memphite kings.Another class of monuments, almost exclusively Egyptian, are the
obelisks, which form such striking objects in front of almost all the
old temples of the country.Small models of obelisks are found in the tombs of the age of the
pyramid builders, and represented in their hieroglyphics; but the oldest
public monument of the class known to exist is that at Heliopolis,
erected by Osirtasen, the great king of the 12th dynasty.It is, like
all the others, a single block of beautiful red granite of Syene, cut
with all the precision of the age, tapering slightly towards the summit,
and of about the average proportion, being about 10 diameters in height;
exclusive of the top it is 67 ft.The two finest known to exist are, that now in the piazza of the
Lateran, originally set up by Thothmes III., 105 ft.in height, and that
still existing at Karnac, attributed to Thothmes II., 107 ft.Both are now ascribed to Queen Hatshepsu their sister, who is recorded
to have boasted that they were quarried, transported, and set up within
the short space of seven months.Those of Luxor, erected by Rameses the
Great, one of which is now in Paris, are above 77 ft.in height; and
there are two others in Rome, each above 80 ft.Rome, indeed, has 12 of these monuments within her walls—a greater
number than exist, erect at least, in the country whence they came;
though judging from the number that are found adorning single temples,
it is difficult to calculate how many must once have existed in Egypt.Their use seems to have been wholly that of monumental pillars,
recording the style and title of the king who erected them, his piety,
and the proof he gave of it in dedicating these monoliths to the deity
whom he especially wished to honour.to 1 in., for
comparison with scale of other buildings.]It has been already remarked that, with scarcely an exception, all the
pyramids are on the west side of the Nile, all the obelisks on the east;
with regard to the former class of monument, this probably arose from a
law of their existence, the western side of the Nile being in all ages
preferred for sepulture, but with regard to the latter it seems to be
accidental.Memphis doubtless possessed many monuments of this class,
and there is reason to believe that the western temples of Thebes were
also similarly adorned.They are, however, monuments easily broken; and,
from their form, so singularly useful for many building purposes, that
it is not to be wondered at if many of them have disappeared during the
centuries that have elapsed since the greater number of them were
erected.Except one small royal pavilion at Medeenet Habû, no structure now
remains in Egypt that can fairly be classed as a specimen of the
domestic architecture of the ancient Egyptians; but at the same time we
possess, in paintings and sculptures, so many illustrations of their
domestic habits, so many plans, elevations, and views, and even models
of their dwellings of every class, that we have no difficulty in forming
a correct judgment not only of the style, but of the details, of their
domestic architecture.Although their houses exhibited nothing of the solidity and monumental
character which distinguished their temples and palaces, they seem in
their own way to have been scarcely less beautiful.They were of course
on a smaller scale, and built of more perishable materials, but they
appear to have been as carefully finished, and decorated with equal
taste to that displayed in the greater works.We know also, from the
tombs that remain to us, that, although the government of Egypt was a
despotism of the strictest class, still the wealth of the land was
pretty equally diffused among all classes, and that luxury and splendour
were by no means confined either to the royal family or within the
precincts of the palace.There is thus every reason to believe that the
cities which have passed away were worthy of the temples that adorned
them, and that the streets were as splendid and as tasteful as the
public buildings themselves, and displayed, though in a more ephemeral
form, the same wealth and power which still astonish us in the great
monuments that remain.Maspero, in his work on Egyptian archæology, translated by Miss
Amelia B. Edwards[59] devotes a chapter to the description of the
existing remains of private dwellings and military architecture.The
examples of the former are of comparatively small buildings, and were
invariably built in crude or unburnt brick; in the neighbourhood of
Memphis Mr.Maspero found walls still standing, from 30 to 40 ft.The plans which are delineated on the walls of the tombs of the
18th dynasty enable us to judge of the extent and magnificence of the
more important examples.These as a rule would seem to have features
which are evidently derived from temple architecture, that is to say,
the palaces are preceded by pylons and the courts enclosed and
surrounded with porticoes.Of military architecture the oldest
fortresses are those at Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh; at Abydos the
earliest example consists of a parallelogram of crude brickwork
measuring 410 ft.The walls, which now stand from 24 to 36
ft.high, have lost somewhat of their original height: they are about 6
ft.thick at the top and were not built in uniform layers, but in huge
vertical panels easily distinguished by the nature of the brickwork.In
one division the course of the bricks is strictly horizontal, in the
next it is slightly concave, and forms a very flat reversed arch, of
which the extrados rests on the ground.The alternation of these two
methods is regularly repeated.The object of this arrangement was
possibly to resist earthquake shocks.Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.View of Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.]No building can form a greater contrast with the temple behind it than
does the little pavilion erected at Medeenet Habû by Rameses, the first
king of the 19th dynasty.As will be seen by the annexed plan (Woodcut
No.34), it is singularly broken and varied in its outline, surrounding
a small court in the shape of a cross.It is 3 storeys in height, and,
properly speaking, consists of only 3 rooms on each floor, connected
together by long winding passages.There is reason, however, to believe
that this is only a fragment of the building, and foundations exist
which render it probable that the whole was originally a square of the
width of the front, and had other chambers, probably only in wood or
brick, besides those we now find.This would hardly detract from the
playful character of the design, and when, as it originally
was, and with its battlements or ornaments complete, it must have formed
a composition as pleasing as it is unlike our usual conceptions of
Egyptian art.The other illustration represents in the Egyptians’ own quaint style a
three-storeyed dwelling, the upper storey apparently being, like those
of the Assyrians, an open gallery supported by dwarf columns.The lower
windows are closed by shutters.In the centre is a staircase leading to
the upper storey, and on the left hand an awning supported on wooden
pillars, which seems to have been an indispensable part of all the
better class of dwellings.Generally speaking, these houses are shown as
situated in gardens laid out in a quaint, formal style, with pavilions,
and fishponds, and all the other accompaniments of gardens in the East
at the present day.In all the conveniences and elegances of building they seem to have
anticipated all that has been done in those countries down to the
present day.Indeed, in all probability the ancient Egyptians surpassed
the modern in those respects as much as they did in the more important
forms of architecture.CHAPTER V

                        GREEK AND ROMAN PERIOD.Decline of art—Temples at Denderah—Kalábsheh—Philæ.The third stage of Egyptian art is as exceptional as the two which
preceded it, and as unlike anything else which has occurred in any other
lands.From the time of the 19th dynasty, with a slight revival under the
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty, Egypt sank through a long period of
decay, till her misfortunes were consummated by the invasion of the
Persians under Cambyses, 525 B.C.From that time she served in a bondage
more destructive, if not so galling, as that of the Shepherd domination,
till relieved by the more enlightened policy of the Ptolemys.Under them
she enjoyed as great material prosperity as under her own Pharaohs; and
her architecture and her arts too revived, not, it is true, with the
greatness or the purity of the great national era, but still with much
richness and material splendour.This was continued under the Roman domination, and, judging from what we
find in other countries, we would naturally expect to find traces of the
influence of Greek and Roman art in the buildings of this age.So
little, however, is this the case, that before the discovery of the
reading of the hieroglyphic signs, the learned of Europe placed the
Ptolemaic and Roman temples of Denderah and Kalábsheh before those of
Thebes in order of date; and could not detect a single moulding in the
architectural details, nor a single feature in the sculpture and
painting which adorned their walls, which gave them a hint of the truth.Even Cleopatra the beautiful is represented on these walls with
distinctly Egyptian features, and in the same tight garments and
conventional forms as were used in the portrait of Nophre Ari, Queen of
Rameses, or in those of the wives of the possessors of tombs in the age
of the pyramids, 3000 years before.Egypt in fact conquered her
conquerors, and forced them to adopt her customs and her arts, and to
follow in the groove she had so long marked out for herself, and
followed with such strange pertinacity.Some of the temples of this age are, as far as dimensions and richness
of decorations are concerned, quite worthy of the great age, though
their plans and arrangements differ to a considerable extent.There is
no longer any hesitation as to whether they should be called temples or
palaces, for they all are exclusively devoted to worship,—and to the
worship of a heavenly God, not of a deified king.What these arrangements are will be well understood from the annexed
plan of that of Edfû (Woodcut No.37), which, though not the largest, is
the most complete of those remaining.in length and 155 in
width, and covers upwards of 70,000 ft.; its dimensions may be said to
be equal to those of the largest of our mediæval cathedrals (Cologne or
Amiens, for instance).Parts only—viz., the court C, and areas M M M—of
the whole structure are roofed, and therefore it can scarcely be
compared with buildings entirely under one roof.Plan of Temple at Edfû, Apollinopolis Magna.In front of the temple are two large and splendid pylons, with the
gateway in the centre, making up a façade 225 ft.Although
this example has lost its crowning cornice, its sculptures and ornaments
are still very perfect, and it may altogether be considered as a fair
specimen of its class, though inferior in dimensions to many of those of
the Pharaonic age.by 161, surrounded
by a colonnade on three sides, and on the fourth side the porch or
portico which, in Ptolemaic temples, takes the place of the great
hypostyle halls of the Pharaohs.It is lighted from the front over low
screens placed between each of the pillars, a peculiarity scarcely ever
found in temples of earlier date, though apparently common in domestic
edifices, or those formed of wood, certainly as early as the middle of
the 18th dynasty, as may be seen from the annexed woodcut (No.39),
taken from a tomb of one of the sun-worshipping kings, who reigned
between Amenhotep III.From this we pass into an inner and
smaller porch, and again through two passages to a dark and mysterious
sanctuary, surrounded by darker passages and chambers, well calculated
to mystify and strike with awe any worshipper or neophyte who might be
admitted to their gloomy precincts.View of Temple at Edfû as it was, before it was
cleared out and the dwellings on the roof removed.]The celebrated temple at Denderah is similar to this, and slightly
larger, but it has no fore-court, no propylons, and no enclosing outer
walls.Its façade is given in the woodcut (No.Its Isis-headed
columns are not equal to those of Edfû in taste or grace; but it has the
advantage of situation, and this temple is not encumbered either by sand
or huts, which still disfigure so many Egyptian temples.Its effect,
consequently, on travellers is always more striking.The Roman temple at Kalábsheh (Woodcuts Nos.42 and 43), above the
Cataract, is a fair specimen of these temples on a smaller scale.43) shows one of the modes by which a scanty light
was introduced into the inner cells, and their gradation in height.The
position, too, of its propylons is a striking instance of the
irregularity which distinguishes all the later Egyptian styles from that
of the rigid, proportion-loving pyramid builders of Memphis.Bas-relief at Tel el Amarna.]Façade of Temple at Denderah.This irregularity of plan was nowhere carried to such an extent as in
the Ptolemaic temple on the island of Philæ (Woodcut No.Here no
two buildings, scarcely any two walls, are on the same axis or parallel
to one another.No Gothic architect in his wildest moments ever played
so freely with his lines or dimensions, and none, it must be added, ever
produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this.It contains all
the play of light and shade, all the variety, of Gothic art, with the
massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style; and as it is still
tolerably entire, and retains much of its colour, there is no building
out of Thebes that gives so favourable an impression of Egyptian art as
this.It is true it is far less sublime than many, but hardly one can be
quoted as more beautiful.Notwithstanding its irregularity, this temple has the advantage of being
nearly all of the same age, and erected according to one plan, while the
greater buildings at Thebes are often aggregations of parts of different
ages; and though each is beautiful in itself, the result is often not
quite so harmonious as might be desired.In this respect the Ptolemaic
temples certainly have the advantage, inasmuch as they are all of one
age, and all completed according to the plan on which they were
designed; a circumstance which, to some extent at least, compensates for
their marked inferiority in size and style, and the littleness of all
the ornaments and details as compared with those of the Pharaonic
period.It must at the same time be admitted that this inferiority is
more apparent in the sculpture of the Ptolemaic age than in its
architecture.The general design of the buildings is frequently grand
and imposing, but the details are always inferior; and the sculpture and
painting, which in the great age add so much to the beauty of the whole,
are in the Ptolemaic age always frittered away, ill-arranged, unmeaning,
and injurious to the general effect instead of heightening and improving
it.Pillar, from the Porticocat Denderah.]Plan of Temple at Kalábsheh.On the east side of the island is the very beautiful structure known as
“Pharaoh’s bed” (n).It is an oblong rectangular building of late date,
surrounded by an intercolumnar screen with 18 columns.It was roofed
with stone slabs supported on wooden beams, the sockets to receive which
still exist.There is a doorway on the west wall, and another on the
east wall opening on to a stone terrace or quay.Similar structures are
believed to have existed at Thebes, close to the river, and connected by
causeways with the temples; they may therefore have served as halls from
which the processions started after disembarking from the boats on the
river.Strange as it may at first sight appear, we know less of the manners and
customs of the Egyptian people during the Greek and Roman domination,
than we do of them during the earlier dynasties.All the buildings
erected after the time of Alexander which have come down to our time are
essentially temples.Nothing that can be called a palace or pavilion has
survived, and no tombs, except some of Roman date at Alexandria, are
known to exist.We have consequently no pictures of gardens, with their
villas and fish-ponds; no farms, with their cattle; no farmyards, with
their geese and ducks; no ploughing or sowing; no representations of the
mechanical arts; no dancing or amusements; no arms or campaigns.Nothing, in short, but worship in its most material and least
intellectual form.Section of Temple at Kalábsheh.It is a curious inversion of the usually received dogmata on this
subject, but as we read the history of Egypt as written on her
monuments, we find her first wholly occupied with the arts of peace,
agricultural and industrious, avoiding war and priestcraft, and
eminently practical in all her undertakings.In the middle period we
find her half political, half religious; sunk from her early happy
position to a state of affairs such as existed in Europe in the Middle
Ages.In her third and last stage we find her fallen under the absolute
influence of the most degrading superstition.We know from her masters
that she had no political freedom and no external influence at this
time; but we hardly expected to find her sinking deeper and deeper into
superstition, at a time when the world was advancing forward with such
rapid strides in the march of civilisation, as was the case between the
ages of Alexander and that of Constantine.It probably was in
consequence of this retrograde course that her civilisation perished so
absolutely and entirely under the influence of the rising star of
Christianity; and that, long before the Arab conquest, not a trace of it
was left in any form.What had stood the vicissitudes of 3000 years, and
was complete and stable under Hadrian, had vanished when Constantine
ascended the throne.If, however, their civilisation passed so suddenly away, their buildings
remain to the present day; and taken altogether, we may perhaps safely
assert that the Egyptians were the most essentially a building people of
all those we are acquainted with, and the most generally successful in
all they attempted in this way.The Greeks, it is true, surpassed them
in refinement and beauty of detail, and in the class of sculpture with
which they ornamented their buildings, while the Gothic architects far
excelled them in constructive cleverness; but with these exceptions no
other styles can be put in competition with them.At the same time,
neither Grecian nor Gothic architects understood more perfectly all the
gradations of art, and the exact character that should be given to every
form and every detail.Whether it was the plain flat-sided pyramid, the
crowded and massive hypostyle hall, the playful pavilion, or the
luxurious dwelling—in all these the Egyptians understood perfectly both
how to make the general design express exactly what was wanted, and to
make every detail, and all the various materials, contribute to the
general effect.They understood, also, better than any other nation, how
to use sculpture in combination with architecture, and to make their
colossi and avenues of sphinxes group themselves into parts of one great
design, and at the same time to use historical paintings, fading by
insensible degrees into hieroglyphics on the one hand, and into
sculpture on the other—linking the whole together with the highest class
of phonetic utterance.With the most brilliant colouring, they thus
harmonised all these arts into one great whole, unsurpassed by anything
the world has seen during the thirty centuries of struggle and
aspiration that have elapsed since the brilliant days of the great
kingdom of the Pharaohs.SERAPEUM AND APIS MAUSOLEUM.The remains of the Serapeum and the burial-places of the sacred bulls
(who, when alive, were worshipped at Memphis), were discovered by M.
Mariette in 1860-61.Of the former, sufficient traces were found to show
that it resembled in its arrangement the ordinary Egyptian temple, viz.,
with pylons, preceded by an avenue of sphinxes, and an enclosed space
behind, with halls and chambers, in one of which was the opening to the
inclined passage leading to the subterranean galleries.The earlier
tombs of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties were hewn in the rocky
platform.From the 22nd to the 25th dynasty the bulls were buried in a
subterranean gallery.The same system was adopted from the 26th dynasty
till the time of the later Ptolemies (_circa_ 50 B.C.), but the
galleries were of greater size and magnificence, having an extent of 400
yards, and the bulls were interred in immense granite sarcophagi placed
in niches, on both sides of the galleries, but never opposite to one
another.The chief historical value of the discovery rests in the
steles, or inscribed tablets, some 500 in number, placed there as
ex-votos by pious visitors, the principal examples of which are now in
the Gizeh Museum or in the Louvre.Kingdom of Meroë—Pyramids.It was long a question with the learned whether civilisation ascended or
descended the Nile—whether it was a fact, as the Greeks evidently
believed, that Meroë was the parent State whence the Egyptians had
migrated to the north, bringing with them the religion and the arts
which afterwards flourished at Thebes and Memphis—or whether these had
been elaborated in the fertile plains of Egypt, and only in later times
had extended to the Upper Nile.Recent discoveries have rendered it nearly certain that the latter is
the correct statement of the facts—within historic times at least—that
the fertile and easily cultivated Delta was first occupied and
civilised; then Thebes, and afterwards Meroë.At the same time it is by
no means improbable that the Ethiopians were of the same stock as the
Thebans, though differing essentially from the Memphites, and that the
former may have regarded these remote kindred with respect, perhaps even
with a degree of half-superstitious reverence due to their remote
situation in the centre of a thinly-peopled continent, and have in
consequence invented those fables which the Greeks interpreted too
literally.If any such earlier civilisation existed in these lands, its records and
its monuments have perished.No building is now found in Meroë whose
date extends beyond the time of the great king Tirhakah, of the 25th
Egyptian dynasty, B.C.724 to 680, unless it be those bearing the name
of one king, Amoum Gori, who was connected with the intruding race of
sun-worshippers, which broke in upon the continuous succession of the
kings of the 18th dynasty.Their monuments were all purposely destroyed
by their successors; and almost the only records we have of them are the
grottoes of Tel el Amarna, covered with their sculptures, which bear, it
must be confessed, considerable resemblance in style to those found in
Ethiopia.Even this indication is too slight to be of much value; and we
must wait for some further confirmation before founding any reasoning
upon it.The principal monuments of Tirhakah are two temples at Gibel Barkal, a
singular isolated mount near the great southern bend of the river.One
is a large first-class temple, of purely Egyptian form and design, about
500 ft.in length by 120 or 140 in width, consisting of two great
courts, with their propylons, and with internal halls and sanctuaries
arranged much like those of the Rameseum at Thebes (Woodcut No.19), and
so nearly also on the same scale as to make it probable that the one is
a copy of the other.The other temple placed near this, but as usual unsymmetrically,
consists of an outer hall, internally about 50 ft.by 60, the roof of
which is supported by four ranges of columns, all with capitals
representing figures of Typhon or busts of Isis.This leads to an inner
cell or sanctuary, cut in the rock.[60]

  FIG.2.—Section and Elevation of that marked A. Scale 50 ft.There are smaller remains strewed about, indicating the existence of a
city on the spot, but nothing of architectural importance.The most remarkable monuments of the Ethiopian kingdom are the pyramids,
of which three great groups have been discovered and described.The
principal group is at a place called Dankelah, the assumed site of the
ancient Meroë, in latitude 17° north.Another is at Gibel Barkal; the
third at Nourri, a few miles lower down than the last named, but
probably only another necropolis of the same city.Compared with the great Memphite examples, these pyramids are most
insignificant in size—the largest at Nourri being only 110 ft.by 100;
at Gibel Barkal the largest is only 88 ft.square; at Meroë none exceed
60 ft.They differ also in form from those of Egypt, being
much steeper, as their height is generally equal to the width of the
base.They also all possess the roll-moulding on their angles, and all
have a little porch or pronaos attached to one side, generally
ornamented with sculpture, and forming either a chapel, or more probably
the place where the coffin of the deceased was placed.We know from the
Greeks that, so far from concealing the bodies of their dead, the
Ethiopians had a manner of preserving them in some transparent
substance, which rendered them permanently visible after death.[61]

To those familiar with the rigid orientation of those of Lower Egypt,
perhaps the most striking peculiarity of the pyramids is the more than
Theban irregularity with which they were arranged, no two being ever
placed, except by accident, at the same angle to the meridian, but the
whole being grouped with the most picturesque diversity, as chance
appears to have dictated.Among their constructive peculiarities it may be mentioned that they
seem all to have been first built in successive terraces, each less in
dimensions than that below it, something like the great pyramid at
Sakkara (Woodcut No.9), these being afterwards smoothed over by the
external straight-lined coating.Like the temples of Gibel Barkal, all these buildings appear to belong
to the Tirhakah epoch of the Ethiopian kingdom.It is extremely
improbable that any of them are as old as the time of Solomon, or that
any are later than the age of Cambyses, every indication seeming to
point to a date between these two great epochs, and to the connection of
African history with that of Asia.The ruins at Wady-el-Ooatib, a little further up the Nile than Meroë,
should perhaps be also mentioned here, if only from the importance given
to them by Heeren, who thought he had discovered in them the ruins of
the temple of Jupiter Ammon.They are, however, all in the debased style
of the worst age of Ptolemaic or Roman art in that country.They are
wholly devoid of hieroglyphics, or any indication of sanctity or
importance, and there can be little doubt that they are the remains of a
caravansera on the great commercial route between Egypt and Axum, along
which the greater part of the trade of the East arrived at Alexandria in
the days of its magnificence.Although widely differing in date from the monuments just
described—except the last—this may be the place to mention a group of
the most exceptional monuments of the world—the obelisks of Axum.It is
said they were originally 55 in number, four of them equal to that shown
in the annexed woodcut, which represents the only one now standing; but
there are fragments of several of these lying about, and some of the
smaller ones still standing, all of the same class and very similar in
design to the large one.Its height, according to Lord Valentia, is 60
ft., its width at base nearly 10, and it is of one stone.The idea is
evidently Egyptian, but the details are Indian.It is, in fact, an
Indian nine-storeyed pagoda, translated in Egyptian in the first century
of the Christian era!(From Lord Valentia’s ‘Travels.’)]

The temple most like it in India is probably that at Budh Gya.That, in
its present form, is undoubtedly more modern, but probably retains many
of its original features.It also resembles the tower at Chittore,[62]
but towers are from their form such frail structures, that certainly
nine-tenths of those that once existed have perished; and it is only
because they are so frequent still in China and other Buddhist countries
that we are sure that the accounts are true which represent them as once
as frequent as in the country of their birth.Be this as it may, this
exceptional monolith exactly represents that curious marriage of Indian
with Egyptian art which we would expect to find in the spot where the
two people came in contact, and enlisted architecture to symbolise their
commercial union.CHAPTER I.

                         ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.It is by no means impossible that the rich alluvial plain of Shinar may
have been inhabited by man as early as the Valley of the Nile; but if
this were so, it is certain that the early dwellers in the land have
left no trace of their sojourn which has as yet rewarded the research of
modern investigators.So far indeed our knowledge at present extends, we
have proof of the existence of the primitive races of mankind in the
valleys of France and England at a far earlier period than we trace
their remains on the banks of either the Euphrates or the Nile.It is
true these European vestiges of prehistoric man are not architectural,
and have consequently no place here, except in so far as they free us
from the trammels of a chronology now admitted to be too limited in
duration, but which has hitherto prevented us from grasping, as we might
have done, the significance of architectural history in its earliest
dawn.Unfortunately for our investigation of Chaldean antiquity, the works of
Berosus, the only native historian we know of, have come down to us in
even a more fragmentary state than the lists of Manetho, and the
monuments have not yet enabled us to supply those deficiencies so
completely, though there is every prospect of their eventually doing so
to a considerable extent.In the meanwhile the most successful attempt
to restore the text which has been made, is that of Herr Gutschmid,[63]
and it is probable that the dates he assigns are very near the truth.Rejecting the 1st dynasty of 86 Chaldeans and their 34,080 years as
mythical, or as merely expressing the belief of the historian that the
country was inhabited by a Chaldean race for a long time before the
Median invasion, he places that event 2458 B.C.His table of dynasties
then runs thus.—

                                      Years.8 Medes               224 commencing 2458
             III.11 Chaldeans           258            2234
              IV.49 Chaldeans           458            1976
               V.9 Arabians            245            1518
              VI.45 Assyrians           526            1273
             VII.8 Assyrians           122             747
            VIII.6 Chaldeans            87             625
                     Persian conquest                    538

As every advance that has been made, either in deciphering the
inscriptions or in exploring the ruins since this reading was proposed,
have tended to confirm its correctness, it may fairly be assumed to
represent very nearly the true chronology of the country from Nimrod to
Cyrus.Assuming this to be so, it is interesting to observe that the
conquest of Babylonia by the Medes only slightly preceded the invasion
of Egypt by the Hyksos, and that the fortification of Avaris “against
the Assyrians”[64] was synchronous with the rise of the great Chaldean
dynasty, most probably under Nimrod, B.C.If this is so, the whole
of the old civilisation of Egypt under the pyramid-building kings had
passed away before the dawn of history in Babylonia.The Theban kings of
the 12th dynasty had spread their conquests into Asia, and thus it seems
brought back the reaction of the Scythic invasion on their own hitherto
inviolate land, and by these great interminglings of the nations Asia
was first raised to a sense of her greatness.What we learn from this table seems to be that a foreign invasion of
Medes—whoever they may have been—disturbed the hitherto peaceful tenor
of the Chaldean kingdom some twenty-five centuries before the Christian
era.They, in their turn, were driven out to make place for the Chaldean
dynasties, which we have every reason to suppose were those founded by
Nimrod about the year 2235 B.C.This kingdom seems to have lasted about seven centuries without any
noticeable interruption, and then to have been overthrown by an invasion
from the west about the year 1518 B.C.Can this mean the Egyptian
conquest under the kings of the great 18th dynasty?The depression of the Chaldeans enabled the Assyrians to raise their
heads and found the great kingdom afterwards known as that of Nineveh,
about the year 1273.For six centuries and a half they were the great
people of Asia, and during the latter half of that period built all
those palaces which have so recently been disinterred.They were struck down in their turn by the kings of Babylonia, who
established the second Chaldean kingdom about the year 625, but only to
give place to the Persians under Cyrus in the year 538, after little
more than a century of duration.As in the Valley of the Nile, the first kingdom was established near the
mouths of the Euphrates, and flourished there for centuries before it
was superseded by the kingdom of Nineveh, in the same manner as Thebes
had succeeded to the earlier seat of power in the neighbourhood of
Memphis.Owing to the fortunate employment of sculptured alabaster slabs to line
the walls of the palaces during the great period of Assyrian prosperity,
we are enabled to restore the plan of the royal palaces of that period
with perfect certainty, and in consequence of the still more fortunate
introduction of stone masonry during the Persian period—after they had
come into contact with the Greeks—we can understand the construction of
these buildings, and restore the form of many parts which, being
originally of wood, have perished.The Plains of Shinar possessed no
natural building material of a durable nature, and even wood or fuel of
any kind seems to have been so scarce that the architects were content
too frequently to resort to the use of bricks only dried in the sun.The
consequence is that the buildings of the early Chaldeans are now
generally shapeless masses, the plans of which it is often extremely
difficult to follow, and in no instance has any edifice been discovered
so complete that we can feel quite sure we really know all about it.Fortunately, however, the temples at Wurka and Mugheyr become
intelligible by comparison with the Birs Nimroud and the so-called tomb
of Cyrus, and the palaces of Nineveh and Khorsabad from the
corresponding ones at Susa and Persepolis.Consequently, if we attempt
to study the architecture of Chaldea, of Assyria, or of Persia, as
separate styles, we find them so fragmentary, owing to the imperfection
of the materials in which they were carried out, that it is difficult to
understand their forms.But taken as the successive developments of one
great style, the whole becomes easily intelligible; and had the southern
excavations been conducted with a little more care, there is perhaps no
feature that would have been capable of satisfactory explanation.Even
as it is, however, the explorations of the last fifteen years have
enabled us to take a very comprehensive view of what the architecture of
the valley of the Euphrates was during the 2000 years it remained a
great independent monarchy.It is a chapter in the history of the art
which is entirely new to us, and which may lead to the most important
results in clearing our ideas as to the origin of styles.Unfortunately,
it is only in a scientific sense that this is true.Except the buildings
at Persepolis, everything is buried or heaped together in such confusion
that the passing traveller sees nothing.It is only by study and
comparison that the mind eventually realises the greatness and the
beauty of the most gorgeous of Eastern monarchies, or that any one can
be made to feel that he actually sees the sculptures which a
Sardanapalus set up, or the tablets which a Nebuchadnezzar caused to be
engraved.Owing to the fragmentary nature of the materials, it must perhaps be
admitted that the study of the ancient architecture of Central Asia is
more difficult and less attractive than that of other countries and more
familiar forms.On the other hand, it is an immense triumph to the
philosophical student of art to have penetrated so far back towards the
root of Asiatic civilisation.It is besides as great a gain to the
student of history to have come actually into contact with the works of
kings whose names have been familiar to him as household words, but of
whose existence he had until lately no tangible proof.In addition to this it must be admitted that the Assyrian exploration
commenced in 1843 by M. Botta, at Khorsabad, and brought to a temporary
close by the breaking out of the war in 1855, have added an entirely new
chapter to our history of architecture; and, with the exception of that
of Egypt, probably the most ancient we can ever now hope to obtain.It
does not, it is true, rival that of Egypt in antiquity, as the Pyramids
still maintain a pre-eminence of 1000 years beyond anything that has yet
been discovered in the valley of the Euphrates, and we now know,
approximately at least, what we may expect to find on the banks of that
celebrated river.There is nothing certainly in India that nearly
approaches these monuments in antiquity, nor in China or the rest of
Asia; and in Europe, whatever may be maintained regarding primæval man,
we can hardly expect to find any building of a date prior to the Trojan
war.All our histories must therefore begin with Egypt and
Assyria—beyond them all is speculation, and new fields of discovery can
hardly be hoped for.The Assyrian discoveries are also most important in supplying data which
enable us to understand what follows, especially in the architectural
history of Greece.No one now probably doubts that the Dorian Greeks
borrowed the idea of their Doric order from the pillars of Beni-Hasan
(Woodcuts Nos.15 and 16) or Nubia—or rather perhaps from the rubble or
brick piers of Memphis or Naucratis,[65] from which these rock-cut
examples were themselves imitated.But the origin of the Ionic element
was always a mystery.We knew indeed that the Greeks practised it
principally in Asia Minor—hence its name; but we never knew how
essentially Asiatic it was till the architecture of Nineveh was revealed
to us, and till, by studying it through the medium of the buildings at
Persepolis, we were made to feel how completely the Ionic order was a
Grecian refinement on the wooden and somewhat Barbaric orders of the
Euphrates valley.It is equally, or perhaps almost more, important to know that in Chaldea
we are able to trace the origin of those Buddhist styles of art which
afterwards pervaded the whole of Eastern Asia, and it may be also the
germs of the architecture of Southern India.[66] These affinities,
however, have not yet been worked out, hardly even hinted at; but they
certainly will one day become most important in tracing the origin of
the religious development of the further East.In these researches neither the literature nor the language of the
country avail us much.If the affinities are ever traced, it will be
through the architecture, and that alone; but there is every prospect of
its proving sufficient for the purpose when properly explored.It will hardly be necessary even to allude to the decipherment of the
mysterious written characters of the Chaldeans.There is probably no one
now living, who has followed up the course of the inquiry with anything
like a proper degree of study, who has any doubt regarding the general
correctness of the interpretation of the arrow-headed inscriptions.Singularly enough, the great difficulty is with regard to proper names,
which as a rule were not spelt phonetically, but were made up of
symbols.This is provoking, as these names afford the readiest means of
comparing the monuments with our histories; and the uncertainty as to
their pronunciation has induced many to fancy that the foundation of the
whole system is unstable.But all this is becoming daily less and less
important as the history itself is being made out from the monuments
themselves.It may also be true that, when it is attempted to translate
literally metaphysical or astrological treatises, there may still be
differences of opinion as to the true meaning of a given passage; but
plain historical narratives can be read with nearly as much certainty as
a chapter of Herodotus or of Plutarch; and every day is adding to the
facility with which they can be deciphered, and to the stock of
materials and facts with which the readings may be checked or rectified.From the materials already collected, combined with the chronology above
sketched out, we are enabled to divide the architectural history of the
Middle Asiatic countries during the period of their ancient greatness
into three distinct and well-defined epochs.The ancient Babylonian or Chaldean period, ranging from B.C.2234
to 1520, comprising the ruins at Wurka, Mugheyr, Abu Shahrein, Niffer,
Kaleh Sherghat, &c. Temples, tombs, and private dwellings, all typical
of a Turanian or Scythic race.The Assyrian and second Chaldean kingdoms, founded about 1290 B.C.,
and extending down to the destruction of Babylon by Cyrus, 538 B.C.,
comprising all the buildings of Nimroud, Koyunjik, Khorsabad, and those
of the second Babylon.An architecture essentially palatial, without
tombs, and few temples, betokening the existence of a Semitic race.The Persian, commencing with Cyrus, 538 B.C., and ending with
Alexander, B.C.333, comprising Pasargadæ, Susa, and Persepolis.An
architecture copied from the preceding: palatial, with rock tombs and
small temples.Aryan it may be, but of so strangely mixed a character
that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from its sister styles.Either it seems to be that Cyrus and his descendants were of Turanian
blood, governing an Aryan people, or that they were Aryan, but that
there was so strong an infusion of Turanians among their subjects that
they were forced to follow their fashions.Perhaps a little of both: but
taking the evidence as it now stands, it seems as if the first
hypothesis is that nearest the truth.These rock-cut tombs, and the
splendour of their sepulchral arrangements generally, savour strongly of
Scythic blood; and their gorgeous palaces, their love of art, the
splendour of their state and ceremonial, all point to feelings far more
prevalent among the Turanians than to anything ever found among kings or
people of an Aryan race.None of these styles, however, are perfectly pure, or distinct one from
the other.The three races always inhabited the country as they do now.And as at this hour the Turkish governor issues his edicts in Turkish,
Arabic, and Persian, so did Darius write the history of his reign on the
rocks at Behistun in Persian, Assyrian, and the old Scythic or Median
tongue.The same three races occupied the country then as they do now.But each race was supreme in the order just given, and the style of each
predominated during the period of their sway, though impregnated with
the feelings and peculiarities of the other two.It is this, indeed,
which gives the architecture of the country in that age its peculiar
value to the archæologist.The three great styles of the world are here
placed in such close juxtaposition, that they can be considered as a
whole, illustrating and supplementing each other, but still sufficiently
distinct never to lose their most marked characteristics.The materials
are still, it must be confessed, somewhat scanty to make all this clear;
but every day is adding to them, and, even now, no one familiar with
architectural analysis can be mistaken in recognising the leading
features of the investigation.Nimrod                     B.C.Bowariyeh, Wurka         2093

Already the names of fifteen or sixteen kings belonging to these old
dynasties have been recovered, and the remains of some ten or twelve
temples have been identified as founded by them; but unfortunately none
of these are in a sufficiently perfect state to afford any certainty as
to their being entirely of this age, and all are in such a state of ruin
that, making use of all the information we possess, we cannot yet
properly restore a temple of the old Chaldean epoch.Notwithstanding this, it is a great gain to the history of architecture
to have obtained so much knowledge as we have of temples which were only
known to us before from the vague descriptions of the Greeks, and which
are the earliest forms of a type of temples found afterwards continually
cropping up in the East.It would be contrary to all experience to suppose that a people of
Turanian origin should be without temples of some sort, but, except the
description by the Greeks of the temple or tomb of Belus, we have
nothing to guide us.We have now a fair idea what the general outline of
their temples was, and even if we cannot trace their origin, we can at
least follow their descendants.There seems now no doubt but that many,
perhaps most, of the Buddhist forms of architecture in India and further
eastward, were derived from the banks of the Euphrates.Many of the
links are still wanting; but it is something to know that the Birs
Nimroud is the type which two thousand years afterwards was copied at
Pagahn in Burmah, and Boro Buddor in Java; and that the descent from
these can easily be traced in those countries and in China to the
present day.The principal reason why it is so difficult to form a distinct idea of
this old form of temple is, that the material most employed in their
construction was either crude, sun-dried, or very imperfectly-burnt
bricks; or when a better class of bricks was employed, as was probably
the case in Babylon, they have been quarried and used in the
construction of succeeding capitals.A good deal also is owing to the
circumstance that those who have explored them have in many cases not
been architects, or were persons not accustomed to architectural
researches, and who consequently have failed to seize the peculiarities
of the building they were exploring.Under these circumstances, it is fortunate that the Persians did for
these temples exactly what they accomplished for the palace forms of
Assyria.They repeated in stone in Persia what had been built in the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris with wood or with crude bricks.It
thus happens that the so-called tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadæ enables us to
verify and to supply much that is wanting in the buildings at Babylon,
and to realise much that would be otherwise indistinct in their forms.The oldest temple we know of at present is the Bowariyeh at Wurka
(Erek), erected by Urukh, at least 2000 years B.C.; but now so utterly
ruined, that it is difficult to make out what it originally was like.It
seems, however, to have consisted of two storeys at least: the lowest
about 200 feet square, of sun-dried bricks; the upper is faced with
burnt bricks, apparently of a more modern date.The height of the two
storeys taken together is now about 100 feet, and it is nearly certain
that a third or chamber storey existed above the parts that are now
apparent.[68]

The Mugheyr Temple[69] is somewhat better preserved, but in this case it
is only the lower storey that can be considered old.The cylinders found
in the angles of the upper part belong to Nabonidus, the last king of
the later Babylonian kingdom; and the third storey only exists in
tradition.Still, from such information as we have, we gather that its
plan was originally a rectangle 198 feet by 133, with nine buttresses in
the longer and six in the shorter faces.The walls <DW72> inwards in the
ratio of 1 in 10.Above them was a second storey 119 feet by 75, placed
as is usual nearer one end of the lower storey, so as to admit of a
staircase being added at the other.It is 47 feet distant from the
south-eastern end, and only 28 or 30 from the other; but whether the
whole of this was occupied by a flight of steps or not is by no means
clear.Taken altogether, the plan and probable appearance of the
building when complete may have been something like that represented in
Woodcuts Nos.48 and 49, though there are too many elements of
uncertainty to make it a restoration which can altogether be depended
upon.Diagram of Elevation of Temple at Mugheyr.The typical example of this class of temples is the Birs Nimroud,[70]
near Babylon.It is true that as it now stands every brick bears the
stamp of Nebochadnassar, by whom it was repaired, perhaps nearly
rebuilt; but there is no reason for supposing that he changed the
original plan, or that the sacred form of these temples had altered in
the interval.It owes its more perfect preservation to the fact of the
upper storey having been vitrified, after erection, by some process we
do not quite understand.This now forms a mass of slag, which has to a
great extent protected the lower storeys from atmospheric influences.In so far as it has been explored, the lower storey forms a perfect
square, 272 feet each way.Above this are six storeys, each 42 feet less
in horizontal dimensions.These are not placed concentrically on those
below them, but at a distance of only 12 feet from the south-eastern
edge, and consequently 30 feet from the N.W., and 21 feet from the two
other sides.Diagram Elevation of Birs Nimroud.The height of the three upper storeys seems to have been ascertained
with sufficient correctness to be 15 feet each, or 45 feet together.Unfortunately no excavation was undertaken to ascertain the height of
the lowest and most important storey.Sir Henry Rawlinson assumes it at
26; and I have ventured to make it 45, from the analogy of the tomb of
Cyrus and the temple at Mugheyr.The height of the two intermediate
storeys, instead of being 22 feet 6 inches, as we might expect, was 26,
which seems to have resulted from some adjustment due to the chambers
which ranged along their walls on two sides.The exact form and
dimensions of these chambers were not ascertained, which is very much to
be regretted, as they seem the counterpart of those which surrounded
Solomon’s Temple and the Viharas in India, and are consequently among
the most interesting peculiarities of this building.No attempt was made to investigate the design of the upper storey,
though it does not seem that it would be difficult to do so, as
fragments of its vaulted roof are strewed about the base of the
tower-like fragment that remains, from which a restoration might be
effected by any one accustomed to such investigations.[71] What we do
know is that it was the cella or sanctuary of the temple.[72] There
probably also was a shrine on the third platform.This temple, as we know from the decipherment of the cylinders which
were found on its angles, was dedicated to the seven planets or heavenly
spheres, and we find it consequently adorned with the colours of each.The lower, which was also richly panelled, was black, the colour of
Saturn; the next, orange, the colour of Jupiter; the third, red,
emblematic of Mars; the fourth, yellow, belonging to the sun; the fifth
and sixth, green and blue respectively, as dedicated to Venus and
Mercury; and the upper probably white, that being the colour belonging
to the Moon, whose place in the Chaldean system would be uppermost.Access to each of these storeys was obtained by stairs, probably
arranged as shown in the plan; these have crumbled away or been removed,
though probably traces of them might still have been found if the
explorations had been more complete.Another temple of the same class was exhumed at Khorsabad about twenty
years ago by M. Place.It consisted, like the one at Borsippa, of seven
storeys, but, in this instance, each was placed concentrically on the
one below it: and instead of stairs on the sloping face, a ramp wound
round the tower, as we are told was the case with the temple of Belus at
Babylon.The four lower storeys are still perfect: each of them is
richly panelled and  as above mentioned, and in some parts even
the parapet of the ramp still remains _in situ_.The three upper storeys
are gone, but may be easily restored from those below, as was done by M.
Place, as shown in the annexed woodcut.According to him, it was an
observatory, and had no cella on its summit.If this was the case it was
a Semitic temple, and belongs to a quite different religion from that
whose temples we have been describing.But unfortunately there is no
direct evidence to determine whether it had such a chamber or not.My
own impressions on the subject are decidedly at variance with those of
M. Place, but until some bas-reliefs are discovered containing
representations of these temples and of their cells, we shall probably
hardly ever know exactly what the form of the crowning member really
was.From the imitations in modern times we seem to see dimly that it
was conical, and possibly curvilinear.The dimensions of this tower at
Khorsabad were, 150 feet square at the base and 135 high from the
pavement to the platform on its summit.Its base, however, was at a
considerable elevation above the plain, so that when seen from below it
must have been an imposing object.Observatory at Khorsabad, from Places ‘Ninive et
l’Assyrie.’ Scale 50 ft.The inscriptions at Borsippa and elsewhere mention other temples of the
same class, and no doubt those of Babylon were more magnificent than any
we have yet found; but they must always have been such prominent
objects, and the materials of which they were composed so easily
removed, that it is doubtful if anything more perfect will now be found.The Mujelibé, described by Rich, and afterwards explored without success
by Layard, is probably the base of the great temple of Belus described
by the Greeks; but even its dimensions can now hardly be ascertained, so
completely is it ruined.It seems, however, to be a parallelogram of
about 600 feet square,[73] and rising to a height of about 140 feet; but
no trace of the upper storeys exist, nor indeed anything which would
enable us to speak with certainty of the form of the basement itself.If
this is the height of the basement, however, analogy would lead us to
infer that the six storeys rose to a height of about 450 feet; and with
the ziggurah or sikra on their summit, the whole height may very well
have been the stadium mentioned by Strabo.[74]

As before mentioned, p.158, we have fortunately in the tomb of Cyrus at
Pasargadæ (Woodcuts Nos.84-86) a stone copy of these temples; in this
instance, however, so small that it can hardly be considered as more
than a model, but not the less instructive on that account.Like the
Birs Nimroud, the pyramid consists of six storeys: the three upper of
equal height, in this instance 23½ inches; the next two are equal to
each other, and, as in the Birs Nimroud, in the ratio of 26 to 15, or 41
inches.The basement is equal to the three upper put together, or 5 ft.9 in., making a total of 18 ft.[75] The height of the cella is
equal to the height of the basement, but this may be owing to the small
size of the whole edifice, it being necessary to provide a chamber of a
given dimension for the sepulchre.In the larger temples, it may be
surmised that the height was divided into four nearly equal parts; one
being given to the basement, one to the two next storeys, one to the
three upper storeys, and the fourth to the chamber on the summit.There is one other source from which we may hope to obtain information
regarding these temples, and that is, the bas-reliefs on the walls of
the Assyrian palaces.They drew architecture, however, so badly, that it
is necessary to be very guarded in considering such representations as
more than suggestions; but the annexed woodcut (No.54) does seem to
represent a four-storeyed temple, placed on a mound, with very tolerable
correctness, and if the upper storey had not been broken away the
drawing might have given us a valuable hint as to the form and purposes
of the cella, which was the principal object of the erection.Its
colouring, too, is gone; but the certain remains of symbolical colours
at Borsippa and Khorsabad confirm so completely the Greek accounts of
the seven- walls of Ecbatana that with the other indications of
the same sort extant that branch of the inquiry may be considered as
complete.(From a Bas-relief from
Koyunjik.)]It is to be hoped that now that the thread is caught, it will be
followed up till this form of temple is thoroughly investigated; for to
the philosophical student of architectural history few recent
discoveries are of more interest.There hardly seems a doubt but that
many temples found further eastward are the direct lineal descendants of
these Babylonian forms, though we as yet can only pick up here and there
the missing links of the chain of evidence which connects the one with
the other.We know, however, that Buddhism is essentially the religion
of a Turanian people, and it has long been suspected that there was some
connection between the Magi of Central Asia and the priests of that
religion, and that some of its forms at least were elaborated in the
valley of the Euphrates.If the architectural investigation is fully
carried out, I feel convinced we shall be able to trace back to their
source many things which hitherto have been unexplained mysteries, and
to complete the history of this form of temple and of the religion to
which it belonged, from the Bowariyeh at Wurka, built 2000 years B.C.,
to the Temple of Heaven erected in the city of Pekin within the limits
of the present century.Elevation of a portion of the external Wall of Wuswus
at Wurka (From Loftus.)]The only exception to the class of temple mounds found in Chaldea is the
ruin of Wuswus, at Wurka,[76] which seems to partake of the character of
a palace.Whether it is or not is by no means clear, as the interior is
too much ruined for its plan to be traced with certainty, and its date
cannot be fixed from any internal evidence.Some of the bricks used in
its construction bear the name of Sin Shada 1700 B.C., but it is
suspected they may have been brought from an older edifice.The same
sort of panelling was used by Sargon at Khorsabad 1000 years after the
assumed date; and panelling very like it is used even in the age of the
Pyramids (Woodcuts Nos.11 and 12), 1000 years at least before that
time.With more knowledge we may recognise minor features which may
enable us to discriminate more exactly, but at present we only know that
this class of panelling was used for the adornment of external walls
from the earliest ages down at least to the destruction of Babylon.It
was probably used with well-marked characteristics in progression of
style; but these we have yet to ascertain.Externally the Wuswus is a
parallelogram 256 ft.Like almost every building in the
Euphrates valley in those ancient times, instead of the sides facing the
cardinal points of the compass, as was the case in Egypt in the Pyramid
age, the angles point towards them.In this case the entrance is in the
north-east face.The centre apparently was occupied by a court; and
opposite the entrance were two larger and several smaller apartments,
the larger being 57 ft.The great interest of the building lies
in the mode in which the external walls were ornamented (Woodcuts Nos.These were plastered and covered by an elaborate series of
reedings and square sinkings, forming a beautiful and very appropriate
mode of adorning the wall of a building that had no external openings.Elevation of Wall at Wurka (From the Report of the
Assyrian Excavation Fund.)]This system is carried still further in a fragment of a wall in the same
city, but of uncertain date.In this instance these reedings—there are
no panels in the smaller fragment—and the plain surfaces are ornamented
by an elaborate mosaic of small cones about 3 or 3½ in.The butt
or thicker end of these is dipped in colour, and they are then built up
into patterns as shown in the woodcut No.It is probable that the
walls of the Wuswus were adorned with similar patterns in colours, but
being executed in less durable materials, have perished.Indeed, from
the accounts which we have, as well as from the remains, we are
justified in asserting that this style of architecture depended for its
effect on colour as much, at least, if not more, than on form.Could
colour be made as permanent this might frequently be wise, but too great
dependence on it has deprived us of half the knowledge we might
otherwise possess of the architectural effects of other times.Shalmaneser I. founded Nimroud                      B.C.1290

All the knowledge which we in reality possess regarding the ancient
palatial architecture of the Euphrates valley[77] is derived from the
exploration of the palaces erected by the great Assyrian dynasty of
Nineveh during the two centuries and a half of its greatest prosperity.Fortunately it is a period regarding the chronology of which there is no
doubt, since the discovery of the Assyrian Canon by Sir Henry
Rawlinson,[78] extending up to the year 900 B.C.: this, combined with
Ptolemy’s Canon, fixes the date of every king’s reign with almost
absolute certainty.It is also a period regarding which we feel more
real interest than almost any other in the history of Asia.Almost all
the kings of that dynasty carried their conquering arms into Syria, and
their names are familiar to us as household words, from the record of
their wars in the Bible.It is singularly interesting not only to find
these records so completely confirmed, but to be able to study the
actual works of these very kings, and to analyse their feelings and
aspirations from the pictures of their actions and pursuits which they
have left on the walls of their palaces.From the accounts left us by the Greeks we are led to suppose that the
palaces of Babylon were superior in beauty and magnificence to those of
Nineveh; and, judging from the extent and size of the mounds still
remaining there, it is quite possible that such may have been the case;
but they are so completely ruined, and have been so long used as
quarries, that it is impossible to restore, even in imagination, these
now formless masses.One thing seems nearly certain, which is, that no stone was used in
their construction.If, consequently, their portals were adorned with
winged bulls or lions, they must have been in stucco.If their walls
were covered with scenes of war or the chase, as those of Nineveh, they
must have been painted on plaster; so that, though their dimensions may
have been most imposing and their splendour dazzling, they must have
wanted the solidity and permanent character so essential to true
architectural effect.It is the employment of stone which alone has enabled us to understand
the arrangements of the Assyrian palaces.Had not their portals been
marked by their colossal genii, we should hardly have known where to
look for them; and if the walls of their apartments had not been
wainscoted with alabaster slabs, we should never have been able to trace
their form with anything like certainty.Practically, all we know of
Assyrian art is due to the fact of their having so suitable a material
as alabaster close at hand, and to the skill with which they knew how to
employ it.Had their walls only been plastered, the mounds of Khorsabad
and Nimroud would have remained as mysterious now as they were before
Layard and Botta revealed to us their splendours.Notwithstanding the wonderful results that were achieved in the ten or
twelve years during which the Assyrian explorations were pursued with
activity, it is by no means impossible but that much more still remains
to reward an energetic and skilful research in these mounds.Still,
seven palaces have been more or less perfectly exhumed; four at Nimroud,
two at Koyunjik, and one at Khorsabad.Among these we have the palaces
of Sennacherib and Sardanapalus, of Esarhaddon, Sargon, Shalmaneser, and
probably of Tiglath Pileser.Consequently the palaces of all the great
kings, whose names are so familiar to us, are laid bare.Beyond these,
the palace of Asshur-bani-pal worthily commences the series before the
kings of Assyria came into contact with the inhabitants of Syria, and
consequently before their Biblical record begins.It may be that other
works of the same kings may be discovered, or the buildings of some less
celebrated monarch, but if we do not know all that is to be known, we
may rest assured that we already have acquired the greater part of the
knowledge that is to be obtained from these explorations.The oldest of the buildings hitherto excavated in Assyria is the
North-West Palace at Nimroud, built by Asshur-bani-pal, about the year
884 B.C.Though not the largest, it more than makes up for this
deficiency by the beauty of its sculptures and the general elegance of
its ornaments.As will be seen by the annexed woodcut (No.58), the
excavated portion of the palace is nearly a square, about 330 ft.The principal entrance was on the north, at the head of a noble
flight of steps leading from the river to the level of the terrace on
which the palace stood.From this, two entrances, adorned with winged
bulls, led to a great hall, 152 ft.in length by 32 in width, at the
upper end of which was situated the throne, and at the lower a smaller
apartment or vestibule opened on the terrace that overlooked the river.Within the great hall was one of smaller dimensions, opening into the
central court of the palace, the entrance of which was so arranged as to
ensure privacy, proving that it partook of the nature of the private
apartment or hareem of the palace.To the eastward of this was a suite
of apartments, three deep, decreasing in width as they receded from the
light, but so arranged that the inner apartments must have been entirely
dark had the walls been carried to the ceiling.As will, however, be
presently explained in describing Khorsabad, it is more than probable
that the walls extended to only half the height of the rooms, and formed
terraces with dwarf pillars on their summits, between which light was
introduced, and they in fact formed the upper storey of the building.To
the south was a double suite, apparently the banqueting halls of the
palace; and to the westward a fourth suite, more ruined, however, than
the rest, owing to its being situated so near the edge of the terrace.As far as can be made out, the rooms on this face seem to have been
arranged three deep: the outer opening on the terrace by three portals,
the central one of which had winged bulls, but the lateral seem to have
been without these ornaments; the whole façade being about 330 ft.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, showing the excavations
as they were left by M. Botta.All these apartments were lined with sculptured slabs, representing
mostly either the regal state of the sovereign, his prowess in war, or
amusements during peace, but many of them were wholly devoted to
religious subjects.Beyond these apartments were many others, covering
at least an equal extent of ground, but their walls having been only
plastered and painted, the sun-burnt bricks of which they were built
have crumbled again to their original mud.It is evident, however, that
they were inferior to those already described, both in form and size,
and applied to inferior purposes.The mound at Nimroud was so much extended after this palace was built,
and so covered by subsequent buildings, that it is now impossible to
ascertain either the extent or form of this, which is the only palace of
the older dynasty known.It will therefore perhaps be as well to turn at
once to Khorsabad, which, being built wholly by one king, and not
altered afterwards, will give a clearer idea of the position and
arrangements of an Assyrian palace than we can obtain from any one on
the Nimroud mound.It has besides this the advantage of being the only
one so complete and so completely excavated as to enable us to form a
correct idea of what an Assyrian palace really was and of all its
arrangements.[80]

The city of Khorsabad was situated about fifteen miles from Nineveh, in
a northerly direction, and was nearly square in plan, measuring about an
English mile each way.Nearly in the centre of the north-western wall
was a gap, in which was situated the mound on which the palace stood.It
seems to have been a peculiarity common to all Assyrian palaces to be so
situated.Their builders wisely objected to being surrounded on all
sides by houses and walls, and at the same time sought the protection of
a walled enclosure to cover the gateways and entrances to their palaces.At Koyunjik and Nimroud the outer face of the palace was covered and
protected by the river Tigris; and here the small brook Kausser flows
past the fort, and, though now an insignificant stream, it is by no
means improbable that it was dammed up so as to form a lake in front of
the palace when inhabited.This piece of water may have been further
deepened by excavating from it the earth necessary to raise the mound on
which the palace stood.That part of the mound in this instance which projected between the
walls was a square of about 650 ft.above
the level of the plain, and protected on every side by a supporting wall
cased with stone of very beautiful masonry (Woodcut No.Behind
this, and inside the city, was a somewhat lower mound, about 300 ft.in length, on which were situated the great
portals of the palace, together with the stables and offices, and,
outside the walls of the palace properly so called, the hareem.All the principal apartments of the palace properly so called were
revêted with sculptural slabs of alabaster, generally about 9 ft.in
height, like those at Nimroud; these either represent the wars or the
peaceful amusements of King Sargon, commemorate his magnificence, or
express his religious feelings.The great portals that gave access to the palace of Khorsabad from the
city were among the most magnificent of those yet discovered.The façade
in which they stood presented a frontage of 330 ft., in which were three
portals; the central one flanked by great human-headed bulls 19 ft.in
height, and on each side two other bulls 15 ft.high, with a giant
strangling a lion between them, as shown in the woodcut (No.62),
representing what still remained of them when uncovered by M. Botta, and
now forming one of the principal ornaments of the British Museum.These
portals were reached from the city by a flight of steps, now entirely
destroyed, but which there can be little difficulty in restoring from
what we find at Persepolis and elsewhere.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, as completely excavated
by M. Place.These portals led to the great outer court of the palace, measuring 315
ft.by 280 between the buttresses with which it was adorned all round.On the right hand were six or seven smaller courts surrounded by the
stables and outhouses of the palace, which were approached by a ramp on
the outside, at the head of which was a block of buildings containing
the cellarage, and generally the stores of eatables.On the left hand of
this court were the metal stores, each room having been appropriated to
iron, copper, or other such materials, and behind them, outside the
palace, was the hareem.[81]

In the northern angle, a rather insignificant passage formed a means of
communication between this great outer court and the next, which was 360
ft.long by 200 wide, and probably open to the country, at least in
front of the great portals.On the inner side of this second court a
magnificent portal opened into what appears to have been the residential
portion of the palace, measuring nearly 300 by 500 ft.Existing Remains of Propylæa at Khorsabad.]The proper entrance to this court was by the ramp before alluded to,
which was indeed the only access to the palace for chariots and
horsemen.From the second court, through the only vaulted passage in the
palace, access was obtained to the state apartments looking over the
country.The three principal of these are shown to a larger scale in the
woodcut (No.64) is a restored section of these apartments, showing what
their arrangement was, and the mode in which it is conceived they were
roofed, according to the information gathered on the spot, and what we
find afterwards practised at Persepolis and elsewhere.[82]

[Illustration: 63.Enlarged Plan of the Three Principal Rooms at
Khorsabad.It will be observed that the area covered by the walls is of nearly the
same extent as that of the rooms themselves, so that the galleries
formed in fact an upper storey to the palace; and thus, in the heat of
the day, the thickness of the walls kept the inner apartments free from
heat and glare, while in the evenings and mornings the galleries formed
airy and light apartments, affording a view over the country, and open
on every side to the breezes that at times blow so refreshingly over the
plains.It will also be observed that by this arrangement the direct
rays of the sun could never penetrate into the halls themselves, and
that rain, or even damp, could easily be excluded by means of curtains
or screens.Restored Section of Principal Rooms at Khorsabad.Restoration of Northern Angle of Palace Court,
Khorsabad.The whole of these state-rooms were revêted with sculptured alabaster
slabs, as shown in the section; above which the walls were decorated
with conventional designs painted on stucco, remains of which were found
among the débris.The external face of this suite, as seen from the north-eastern court,
was probably something very like what is shown in the woodcut (No.66),
though there are less materials for restoring the exterior than there
are for the internal parts of the palace.The arched entrance to the
court, shown on the left, is certain: so also, I conceive, is the mode
in which the light was introduced into the apartments.The details of
the pillars are not so certain, though not admitting of much latitude of
doubt.As before mentioned, outside the palace stood the hareem, of a somewhat
irregular form, but measuring 400 ft.by 280, (on left of plan, woodcut
No.The whole of its external walls are adorned with reeded
pilasters and panels like those of the Wuswus at Wurka (Woodcut No.61),
which is not the case with any other part of the palace.It has only one
small external opening from the terrace, and another, which may be
called a concealed one, from the great outer court.Internally its
arrangements are very remarkable.First there is an outer court into
which these two entrances open, and within that two other courts, on
whose side are extended what may be called three complete suites of
apartments, very similar to each other in arrangement, though varied in
dimensions.It looks as if each was appropriated to a queen, and that
their relative magnificence accorded with the dignity of the person to
whom it was assigned.But are we justified in assuming that Sargon had
three queens, and only that number of legitimate wives?Assuming this,
however, there is still room in this hareem for any number of concubines
and their attendants.The central court of the hareem is one of the richest discoveries that
rewarded M. Place’s industry.It was adorned with six free-standing
statues—the smaller court with two—and the walls were wainscoted with
enamelled tile representing the king, his vizier, lions, eagles, vines
and fruits, and other objects in a bright yellow colour on a blue
ground.The whole is, in fact, one of the most curious and interesting
discoveries yet made in these palaces.As it can hardly admit of a doubt that this was really the hareem of the
palace, it is curious that such a building as the observatory described
above (p.162), should have been erected in its immediate proximity.Every one ascending the ramp or standing on its summit must have looked
into its courts, unless they were covered with awnings or roofs in some
manner we do not quite understand; and we can hardly assume that such a
tower was intended as the praying place of the king and the king only.The fact is undoubted, however we may explain it.From the above description it will be observed that in every case the
principal part, the great mass, of the palace was the terrace on which
it stood, which was raised by artificial means to a height of 30 ft.and
more, and, as shown in the illustration (Woodcut No.60), carefully
revêted with stone.On this stood the palace, consisting principally of
one great block of private apartments situated around an inner square
court.From this central mass two or three suites of apartments
projected as wings, so arranged as to be open to the air on three sides,
and to give great variety to the outline of the palace as seen from
below, and great play of light and shade in every aspect under which the
building could be surveyed.So far also as we can judge, the whole
arrangements were admirably adapted to the climate, and the ornaments
not only elegant in themselves, but singularly expressive and
appropriate to the situations in which they are found.Another most important discovery of M. Place is that of the great arched
gates of the city.These were apparently always constructed in pairs—one
for the use of foot-passengers, the other for wheeled carriages, as
shown by the marks of wheels worn into the pavement in the one case,
while it is perfectly smooth in the other.Those appropriated to carriages had plain jambs rising perpendicularly
12 or 15 ft.These supported a semicircular arch, 18 ft.in diameter,
adorned on its face with an archivolt of great beauty, formed of blue
enamelled bricks, with a pattern of figures and stars of a warm yellow
colour, relieved upon it.The gateways for foot-passengers were nearly of the same dimensions,
about 14 or 15 ft.broad, but they were ornamented by winged bulls with
human heads, between which stood giants strangling lions.In the example
illustrated in the annexed woodcut (No.67), the arch sprang directly
from the backs of the bulls, and was ornamented by an archivolt similar
to that over the carriage entrances, and which is perhaps as beautiful a
mode of ornamenting an arch as is to be found anywhere.Other arches have been found in these Assyrian excavations, but none of
such extent as these, and none which show more completely how well the
Assyrians in the time of Sargon (721 B.C.)understood not only the
construction of the arch, but also its use as a decorative architectural
feature.[83]

[Illustration: 68.Interior of a Yezidi House at Bukra, in the Sinjar.]There must always be many points, even in royal residences, which would
be more easily understood if we knew the domestic manners and usages
prevalent among the common people of the same era and country.This
knowledge we actually can supply in the present case, to a great extent,
from modern Eastern residences.Such a mode of illustration in the West
would be out of the question; but in the East, manners and customs,
processes of manufacture and forms of building, have existed unchanged
from the earliest times to the present day.This immutability is the
greatest charm of the East, and frequently enables us to understand what
in our own land would have utterly faded away and been obliterated.In
the Yezidi house, for instance, borrowed from Mr.Layard’s work, we see
an exact reproduction, in every essential respect, of the style of
building in the days of Sennacherib.Here we have the wooden pillars
with bracket capitals, supporting a mass of timber intended to be
covered with a thickness of earth sufficient to prevent the rain or heat
from penetrating to the dwelling.There is no reason to doubt that the
houses of the humbler classes were in former times similar to that here
represented; and this very form amplified into a palace, and the walls
and pillars ornamented and carved, would exactly correspond with the
principal features of the palace of the great Assyrian king.PALACE OF SENNACHERIB, KOYUNJIK.Having said so much of Khorsabad, it will not be necessary to say much
about the palace at Koyunjik, built by Sennacherib, the son of the
Khorsabad king.As the great metropolitan palace of Nineveh, it was of course of far
greater extent and far more magnificent than the suburban palace of his
father.The mound itself on which it stands is about 1½ mile in
circumference (7800 ft.); and, as the whole was raised artificially to
the height of not less than 30 ft., it is in itself a work of no mean
magnitude.The principal palace stood at the south-western angle of this mound, and
as far as the excavation has been carried seems to have formed a square
of about 600 ft.each way—double the lineal dimensions of that at
Nimroud.Its general arrangements were very similar to those at
Khorsabad, but on a larger scale.It enclosed within itself two or three
great internal courts, surrounded with sixty or seventy apartments, some
of great extent.The principal façade, facing the east, surpassed any of
those of Khorsabad, both in size and magnificence, being adorned by ten
winged bulls of the largest dimensions, with a giant between each of the
two principal external ones, in the manner shown in the woodcut (No.62), besides smaller sculptures—the whole extending to a length of not
less than 350 ft.The principal façade at Khorsabad, as above mentioned,
extended 330 ft., but the bulls and the portals there were to those at
Koyunjik in the proportion of 30 to 40, which nearly indeed expresses
the relative magnificence of the two palaces.Inside the great portal at
Koyunjik was a hall, 180 ft.in length by 42 in width, with a recess at
each end, through which access was obtained to two courtyards, one on
the right and one on the left; and beyond these to the other and
apparently the more private apartments of the palace, which overlooked
the country and the river Tigris, flowing to the westward of the
palace—the principal entrance, as at Khorsabad, being from the city.[84]

It is impossible, of course, to say how much further the palace
extended, though it is probable that nearly all the apartments which
were revêted with sculptures have been laid open; but what has been
excavated occupies so small a portion of the mound that it is impossible
to be unimpressed with the conviction that it forms but a very small
fraction of the imperial palace of Nineveh.Judging even from what has
as yet been uncovered, it is, of all the buildings of antiquity, alone
surpassed in magnitude by the great palace-temple at Karnac; and when we
consider the vastness of the mound on which it was raised, and the
richness of the ornaments with which it was adorned, a doubt arises
whether it was not as great, or at least as expensive, a work as the
great palace-temples of Thebes.The latter, however, were built with far
higher motives, and designed to last through ages, while the palace at
Nineveh was built only to gratify the barbaric pride of a wealthy and
sensual monarch, and perished with the ephemeral dynasty to which he
belonged.PALACE OF ESARHADDON.Another Assyrian palace, of which considerable remains still exist, is
that of Esarhaddon, commonly known as the South-west Palace at Nimroud.Like the others, this too has been destroyed by fire, and the only part
that remains sufficiently entire to be described is the entrance or
southern hall.in
width, and it consequently is the largest hall yet found in Assyria.The
architects, however, either from constructive necessities or for
purposes of state, divided it down the centre by a wall supporting dwarf
columns,[85] forming a central gallery, to which access was had by
bridge galleries at both ends, a mode of arrangement capable of great
variety and picturesqueness of effect, and of which there is little
doubt that the builders availed themselves to the fullest extent.This
led into a courtyard of considerable dimensions, surrounded by
apartments, but they are all too much destroyed by fire to be
intelligible.Another great palace, built, as appears from the inscriptions, by a son
of Esarhaddon, has been discovered nearly in the centre of the mound at
Koyunjik.Its terrace-wall has been explored for nearly 300 ft.in two
directions from the angle near which the principal entrance is placed.lower than the palace itself, which is reached
by an inclined passage nearly 200 ft.in length, adorned with sculpture
on both sides.The palace itself, as far as its exploration has been
carried, appears similar in its arrangements to those already described;
but the sculptures with which it is adorned are more minute and
delicate, and show a more perfect imitation of nature, than the earlier
examples, though inferior to them in grandeur of conception and breadth
of design.The architectural details also display a degree of elegance and an
amount of elaborate finish not usually found in the earlier examples, as
is well illustrated by the Woodcut No.71, representing one of the
pavement slabs of the palace.It is of the same design, and similarly
ornamented, but the finish is better, and the execution more elaborate,
than in any of the more ancient examples we are acquainted with.Besides these, there were on the mound at Nimroud a central palace built
by Tiglath Pileser, and one at the south-eastern angle of the mound,
built by a grandson of Esarhaddon; but both are too much ruined for its
being feasible to trace either their form or extent.Around the great
pyramid, at the north-west angle of the mound, were buildings more
resembling temples than any others on it—all the sculptures upon them
pointing apparently to devotional purposes, though in form they differed
but little from the palaces.At the same time there is certainly nothing
in them to indicate that the mound at the base of which they were
situated was appropriated to the dead, or to funereal purposes.Between
the north-west and south-west palaces there was also raised a terrace
higher than the rest, on which were situated some chambers, the use of
which it is not easy to determine.Pavement Slab from the Central Palace, Koyunjik.]Notwithstanding the impossibility that now exists of making out all the
details of the buildings situated on the great mounds of Nimroud and
Koyunjik, it is evident that these great groups of buildings must have
ranked among the most splendid monuments of antiquity, surrounded as
they were by stone-faced terraces, and approached on every side by noble
flights of stairs.When all the palaces with their towers and temples
were seen gay with colour, and crowded with all the state and splendour
of an Eastern monarch, they must have formed a scene of such dazzling
magnificence that one can easily comprehend how the inhabitants of the
little cities of Greece or Judea were betrayed into such extravagant
hyperbole when speaking of the size and splendour of the great cities of
Assyria.Pavilion, from the Sculptures at Khorsabad.]The worst feature of all this splendour was its ephemeral
character—though perhaps it is owing to this very fact that we now know
so much about it—for, like the reed that bends to the storm and recovers
its elasticity, while the oak is snapped by its violence, these relics
of a past age have retained to some extent their pristine beauty.Had
these buildings been constructed like those of the Egyptians, their
remains would probably have been applied to other purposes long ago; but
having been overwhelmed so early and forgotten, they have been preserved
to our day; nor is it difficult to see how this has occurred.The
pillars that supported the roof being of wood, probably of cedar, and
the beams on the under side of the roof being of the same material,
nothing was easier than to set fire to them.The fall of the roofs,
which were probably composed, as at the present day, of five or six feet
of earth, and which is requisite to keep out heat as well as wet, would
alone suffice to bury the building up to the height of the sculptures.The gradual crumbling of the thick walls consequent on their unprotected
exposure to the atmosphere would add three or four feet to this: so that
it is hardly too much to suppose that green grass might have been
growing over the buried palaces of Nineveh before two or three years had
elapsed from the time of their destruction and desertion.When once this
had taken place, the mounds afforded far too tempting positions not to
be speedily occupied by the villages of the natives; and a few centuries
of mud-hut building would complete the process of entombment so
completely as to protect the hidden remains perfectly for the centuries
during which they have lain buried.These have now been recovered to
such an extent as enables us to restore their form almost as certainly
as we can those of the temples of Greece or Rome, or of any of the great
nations of antiquity.Assyrian Temple, North Palace, Koyunjik.Bas-relief, representing façade of Assyrian Palace.It is by no means improbable that at some future period we may be able
to restore much that is now unintelligible, from the representations of
buildings on the sculptures, and to complete our account of their style
of architecture from illustrations drawn by the Assyrians themselves.One or two of these have already been published.The annexed woodcut,
for instance (No.72), of a bas-relief representing a little
fishing-pavilion on the water’s edge, exhibits in a rude manner all the
parts of an Assyrian order with its entablature, and the capital only
requires to be slightly elongated to make it similar to those found at
Persepolis.Another from the North Palace, Koyunjik, repeats the same arrangement,
with pillars which must be considered as early examples of the
Corinthian order, and, if we may trust the drawing, it likewise
represents an aqueduct with horizontally constructed arches of pointed
form.74) from the same palace seems intended to
portray a complete palace façade, with its winged bulls in the entrance
and its colossal lions on the front.Above these animals, but not
apparently meant to be represented as resting on them, are pillars in
antis, as in the two previous illustrations.[86] Unfortunately the
cornice is broken away, and the whole is more carelessly executed than
is usual in these sculptures.Exterior of a Palace, from a Bas-relief at Koyunjik.]75) is that of a palace of
two storeys, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik, showing a range of openings
under the roof in both storeys, each opening being divided into three
parts by two Ionic columns between square piers, and are probably meant
to represent such an arrangement as that shown in Woodcuts Nos.On the right the upper storey is a correct representation of the
panelled style of ornamentation above alluded to as recently discovered
at Khorsabad and elsewhere, and which we know from recent discoveries to
have been so favourite a mode of decorating walls in that age.The most remarkable fact, however, that we gather from all these
illustrations is, that the favourite arrangement was a group of pillars
“distyle in antis,” as it is technically termed, viz., two circular
pillars between two square piers.It is frequently found elsewhere in
the façade of tombs, but here it seems to have been repeated over and
over again to make up a complete design.For a temple such an
arrangement would have been inadmissible: for a palace it seems
singularly appropriate and elegant.(From Bas-relief, British Museum.)]Further comparisons will no doubt do much to complete the subject; and
when the names written over these bas-reliefs are definitively
deciphered, we may find that we really possess contemporary
representations, if not of Jerusalem, at least of Lachish, of Susa, and
other cities familiar to us both from ancient and from modern history.Horse-Tent (Nimroud).]We have no representation of the dwellings of private individuals so
complete as to enable us to understand them, but there are several of
royal camps which are interesting.Among the most curious of these are
the representations of the tents of the king and his nobles.One of
these is shown in Woodcut No.76, though how it was constructed is by no
means clear.It seems to have been open in the centre to the air, but
covered at either end by a sort of hood so arranged as to catch the
passing breeze, and afford protection from rain at the same time.The
annexed woodcut (No.77), representing the front and one side of the
royal horse-tent, gives a good idea of the luxury and elegance that was
carried into the detail even of subordinate structures.Except the Chaldean-formed temples, which have been described in the
previous chapter, there are no religious edifices sufficiently complete
to enable us to form a distinct idea of what the architectural
arrangements of these temples were.As belonging to a Semitic people we
should expect them to be few and insignificant.So little remains of the temple at Khorsabad, that it is difficult to
say what its original form may have been; the terrace, however, which
supported it is interesting, as it shows almost the only instance of a
perfect Assyrian moulding or cornice betraying a similarity to the forms
of Egyptian architecture which we do not find elsewhere.The curve,
however, is not exactly that of an Egyptian cornice, being continued
beyond the vertical tangent; but this may have arisen from the terrace
being only six feet in height, which placed the curve below the line of
sight, and so required a different treatment from one placed so high
above it as is usually the case in Egypt.Elevation of Stylobate of temple.]The bas-relief on the next page is perhaps the best sculptured
representation that exists of what we might fancy an Assyrian temple to
have been.The emblem so enshrined is probably the Asheerah, or grove,
to the worship of which the Israelites at all times showed such a
tendency to relapse, and is one of the most frequent objects of
adoration among the Assyrians.As a Semitic people we should hardly expect to find any tombs among
them, and indeed, unless the pyramid at the north-west angle of the
Nimroud mound is the tomb of Sardanapalus, mentioned by the Greeks,[87]
it is not clear that a single Assyrian sepulchre has yet been
discovered.Those that crowd and choke the ruins of Wurka and Mugheyr
and other cities of Babylonia are the remains of a Turanian people who
always respected their dead, and paid especial attention to the
preservation of their bodies.The pyramid at Nimroud seems to have been
explored with sufficient care to enable us to affirm that no stairs or
inclined plane led to its summit, and without these it certainly was not
one of those observatory temples before alluded to.Still, it is so
singular to have one monument, and one only, of its class, that it is
difficult to form a satisfactory opinion on the subject.It stands at the north-west angle of the mound, and measures 167 ft.in height, is composed of beautiful stone
masonry, ornamented by buttresses and offsets, above which the wall was
continued perpendicularly in brickwork.In the centre of the building,
and on the level of the base or terrace, a long vaulted gallery or
tunnel was discovered, but it contained no clue to the destination of
the building.Sacred Symbolic Tree of the Assyrians.(From Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone.)](From Layard’s ‘Nineveh.’)]

The whole now rises to a height of about 120 ft.from the plain, and is
composed of sun-dried bricks, with courses of kiln-burnt bricks between
them, at certain intervals towards the summit, which render it probable
that it originally was not a pyramid in the usual sense of the term, but
a square tower, rising in three or four storeys, each less than the
lower one, as in the traditional temple of Belus at Babylon, or like the
summit of the obelisk represented in the woodcut (No.81), which most
probably is a monolithic reproduction of such a sepulchral tower as
this, rather than an obelisk like those of Egypt.Other obelisks have since been discovered, some of which look even more
like miniature models of structural buildings than this one does.Till further information is obtained, it will hardly be possible to say
much that is satisfactory with regard to either the tombs, temples, or
minor antiquities of the Assyrian people.Their architecture was
essentially Palatial—as that of the Greeks was Templar—and to that alone
our remarks might almost be confined.Fortunately, however, sculpture
was another art to which they were specially addicted, and to their
passion for this we owe most of our knowledge of their manners and
customs.To this art also we are indebted for our ability to restore
many details of their palaces and buildings, which without its aid would
have been altogether unintelligible.Judged by the same rules of criticism which we apply to Classic or
Mediæval art, the architecture of the Assyrians must, it is feared, rank
very low.But for gorgeous Barbaric splendour of effect it seems
difficult to imagine anything that could well have been grander or more
imposing than the palaces of Nineveh must have been when entire and
filled with the state and magnificence of the monarchs of the Assyrian
empire.Cyrus founds Pasargadæ                                     B.C.560

There still remains a third chapter to write before the survey of the
architecture of the central region of Asia is complete—before indeed a
great deal which has just been assumed can become capable of proof.By a
fortunate accident the Persians used stone where the Assyrians used only
wood, and consequently many details of their architecture have come down
to our day which would otherwise have passed away had the more
perishable materials of their predecessors been made use of.Whatever else the ancient world may owe to the learning of the
Egyptians, it seems certain that they were the first to make use of
stone as a constructive building material.As before mentioned, the
Egyptians used a stone Proto-Doric pillar at least 1000 years before the
Greeks or the Etruscans, or any other ancient people we know of, dreamt
of such a thing.The Babylonians and Assyrians never seem to have used
stone constructively, except as the revêtement of a terrace wall; and it
was not till after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses that we find any
Asiatic nations using a pillar of stone in architecture, or doing more
than building a wall, or heaping mass on mass of this material without
any constructive contrivance.The Indians first learned this art from
the Bactrian Greeks, and many civilised Asiatic nations still prefer
wood for their palaces and temples, as the Assyrians did, and only use
stone as “a heap.” It must have been difficult, however, for any
intelligent people to visit the wonderful stone temples of Thebes and
Memphis without being struck by their superior magnificence and
durability; and we consequently find the Persians on their return,
though reproducing their old forms, adopting the new material, which,
fortunately for them and for our history, was found in abundance in the
neighbourhood of their capitals.Even, however, on the most cursory inspection, it is easy to see how
little the arts of the Assyrians were changed by their successors.The
winged lions and bulls that adorn the portals at Persepolis are
practically identical with those of Nineveh.The representations of the
king on his throne with his attendants are so similar, that but for the
locality it would require considerable knowledge to discriminate between
Sennacherib and Xerxes.The long procession of tribute bearers—the
symbolical animals slain by the king; the whole ornamentation, in fact,
is so slightly altered from what existed in Assyria, that we are
startled to find how little change in these sculptures the new dynasty
had introduced; and if this is the case with them, and their position
and arrangement are nearly identical, we may feel very certain that the
architecture was also the same.It appears at first sight to have been otherwise; but on closer
examination it appears quite certain that this even is due more to the
material employed than to any alteration in form.Something may be due
to the fact that the buildings we now find on the platform at Persepolis
may have been dedicated to somewhat different purposes than were those
of Nineveh; but even this is not quite clear.If the great square courts
of the Ninevite palaces were roofed over, as Layard suggested—and as
probably was the case—they would exactly represent the square halls of
Persepolis.But as all the intermediate buildings of sun-dried brick
have been washed off the bare rock by the winter rains of Persia, we can
only speculate on what they might have been, without daring to lay too
much stress on our convictions.In their present state the remains at Pasargadæ are, perhaps, more
interesting to the antiquary than to the architect, the palaces on the
plain being so ruined that their architectural arrangements cannot be
understood or restored.Elevation of Platform at Pasargadæ.]On the side of a hill overlooking the plain is a platform of masonry
(Woodcut No.82) which originally supported either a temple or
fire-altar, but this has now entirely disappeared, and the structure is
only remarkable for the beauty of its masonry and the large dimensions
of the stones with which it is built.83), not only at their joints but often on their faces, with the same
flat sinking as is found in all the Jewish works at Jerusalem, and
sometimes in Greek buildings of the best age.Thus an ornament of great
beauty and elegance is formed out of what would otherwise be merely a
plain mass of masonry.The tomb of Cyrus has already been referred to (p.164) as a copy in
stone of one of the ziggurats or terrace-temples.But it must be borne
in mind that the most celebrated example of this form is as often called
the tomb, as the temple of Belus;[88] and among a Turanian people the
tomb and the temple may be considered as one and the same thing.The
tomb is surrounded on three sides[89] by a portico of columns standing
14 feet apart: no stone capitals have been found, but it is probable
that the columns carried wooden bracket-capitals to diminish the bearing
of the wooden architrave or beam which supported the roof.Beyond the
portico there are the traces of a second enclosure 25 feet wide, which,
from its width, was probably an open court.(From Texier’s ‘Arménie et la
Perse.’)]

On the plain are the remains of buildings, three of which were palaces,
and one the ruin of a tomb.The plan of one of them, called the palace
of Cyrus, has been measured and published by M. Texier, MM.Flandin &
Coste, and M. Dieulafoy, and although the restoration given by the
latter goes somewhat farther than the remains will account for, there
are certain features in which they all agree, and which show that it
contained at least two porches or porticoes and a great hall of columns
not dissimilar from the examples found at Persepolis.The angle piers or
responds of two porticoes still exist in situ; on one of them in the
upper stone is cut the socket in which the architrave of the portico
rested, the form of this socket having a peculiar value, as it shows
more clearly than the socket in the respond of the portico of the palace
of Darius, that the Persian architrave was composed of two or more beams
placed one over the other, and overhanging, as in the tomb of Darius.A
second pier has an inscription which enables us to ascribe its erection
to Cyrus.A column, 34 feet high, of the great hall still remains, which
shows that at all events in this case the central hall rose above the
porticoes, deriving its light therefore through clerestory windows.No
capitals have been found,[90] and it is possible therefore they were in
wood, as we have suggested may have been the case in the portico of the
tomb of Cyrus.Plan of Tomb of Cyrus, Pasargadæ.To the east of this palace, and distant about 170 yards, are the remains
of a second palace with a hall of columns, and measuring 124 by 49 ft.,
and on the west side of it is the stone jamb of a doorway similar to
those at Persepolis, and carved with the well-known bas-relief of Cyrus.The third palace has been excavated by Mr.Weld Blundell, and the
foundations of its walls traced, measuring 187 by 131 ft., with a hall
of 24 columns.At Nineveh, as we have seen, all the pillars, the roofs, and the
constructive parts of the building, which were of wood,[91] have
disappeared, and left nothing but the massive walls, which, falling and
being heaped the one on the other, have buried themselves and their
ornaments till the present day.At Persepolis, on the contrary, the
brick walls, being thinner and exposed on the bare surface of the naked
rock, have been washed away by the storms and rains of 2000 years,
leaving only the skeletons of the buildings.In the rocky country of
Persia, however, the architect fortunately used stone; and we have thus
at Persepolis, if the expression may be used, all the bones of the
building, but without the flesh; and at Nineveh, the flesh, but without
the bones that gave it form and substance.View from top of Great Stairs at Persepolis.]The general appearance of the ruins, as they at present stand, will be
seen from the woodcut (No.[92] The principal mass in the foreground
on the left is the Propylæa of Xerxes, and behind that and to the right
stand the pillars of the Chehil Minar, or Great Hall of Xerxes.Between
these are seen in the distance the remains of the smaller halls of
Darius and Xerxes.The most striking features in this view are the staircases that led from
the plain to the platform, and from the lower level to that on which the
great hall stood.Indeed, among these ruins, nothing is more remarkable
than these great flights of steps.The builders of those days were, so
far as we know, the only people who really understood the value of this
feature.The Egyptians seem wholly to have neglected it, and the Greeks
to have cared little about it; but it was not so at Nineveh, where, so
far as we can understand from the indistinct traces left, the stairs
must have been one of the most important parts of the design.But they
were so situated that they were not buried when the buildings were
ruined, and consequently have been removed.At Jerusalem, too, we read
that when the Queen of Sheba saw “the ascent by which Solomon went up to
the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.” Indeed, in all
the ancient temples and palaces of this district, more attention is paid
to this feature than to almost any other; and from their favourable
situation on artificial terraces, the builders were enabled to apply
their stairs with far more effect than any others in ancient or in
modern times.The lower or great staircase at Persepolis is plain, and without any
sculpture, but is built of the most massive Cyclopean masonry, and of
great width and very easy acclivity.That in front of the great hall is
ornamented with sculpture, in three tiers, representing the people of
the land bringing presents and the subject nations tribute, to lay at
the feet of the monarch, combined with mythological representations; the
whole bearing a very considerable resemblance to the sculptures on the
walls of the Assyrian palaces, though the position is different.The
arrangement of these stairs, too, is peculiar, none of them being at
right angles to the buildings they approach, but all being double,
apparently to permit of processions passing the throne, situated in the
porches at their summit, without interruption, and without altering the
line of march.One of these flights, leading to the platform of Xerxes’ palace, is
shown in the woodcut (No.In arrangement it is like the stairs
leading to the great terrace, but very much smaller, and is profusely
adorned with sculpture.The principal apartment in all the buildings situated on the platform is
a central square hall, the floor of which is studded with pillars placed
equidistant the one from the other.The smallest have 4 pillars, the
next 16, then 36, and one has 100 pillars on its floor; but to avoid
inventing new names, we may call these respectively, distyle,
tetrastyle, hexastyle, and decastyle halls, from their having 2, 4, 6,
or 10 pillars on each face of the phalanx, and because that is the
number of the pillars in their porticoes when they have any.The building at the head of the great stairs is a distyle hall, having 4
pillars supporting its roof.On each side of the first public entrance
stands a human-headed winged bull, so nearly identical with those found
in Assyrian palaces as to leave no doubt of their having the same
origin.At the opposite entrance are two bulls without wings, but drawn
with the same bold, massive proportions which distinguish all the
sculptured animals in the palaces of Assyria and Persia.The other, or
palace entrance, is destroyed, the foundation only remaining; but this,
with the foundations of the walls, leaves no room to doubt that the
annexed woodcut (No.89) is a true representation of its
ground-plan.[93] Nor can it be doubted that this is one of those
buildings so frequently mentioned in the Bible as a “gate,” not the door
of a city or buildings, but a gate of justice, such as that where
Mordecai sat at Susa—where Abraham bought his field—where Ruth’s
marriage was judged of—and, indeed, where public business was generally
transacted.There are three other distyle halls or gates on the platform: one to the
westward of this, very much ruined; one in the centre of the whole
group, which seems to have had external porticoes; and a third on the
platform in front of the palace of Xerxes.There are two tetrastyle halls, one of which, erected by Darius (woodcut
No.90), is the most interesting of the smaller buildings on the
terrace.It is the only building that faces the south, and is approached
by a flight of steps, represented with the whole façade of the palace as
it now stands in the woodcut (No.These steps led to a tetrastyle
porch, two ranges in depth, which opened into the central hall with its
16 columns, around which were arranged smaller rooms or cells, either
for the occupation of the king, if it was a palace, or of the priests if
a temple.In the western side a staircase and doorway were added,
somewhat unsymmetrically, by Artaxerxes.These remains would hardly suffice to enable us to restore the external
appearance of the palace; but fortunately the same king who built the
palace for his use on this mound, repeated it in the rock as an “eternal
dwelling” for himself after death.The tomb known as that of Darius at
Naksh-i-Rustam (woodcut No.92), is an exact reproduction, not only of
the architectural features of the palace, but to the same scale, and in
every respect so similar, that it seems impossible to doubt but that the
one was intended as a literal copy of the other.Assuming it to be so,
we learn what kind of cornice rested on the double bull capitals.And
what is still more interesting, we obtain a representation of a prayer
platform, which we have described elsewhere as a Talar,[94] but the
meaning of which we should hardly know but for this representation.The other tetrastyle hall is similar to this, but plainer and somewhat
smaller.Façade of Palace of Darius at Persepolis.Turning from these to the hexastyle halls, the smallest but most perfect
(Woodcut No.91) is that standing on the southern edge of the upper
platform, the inscriptions on which certainly prove it to have been
built by Xerxes.Tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustam, representing the
façade of his Palace surmounted by a Talar.]The platform on which it stands is approached by two flights of steps,
that on the east being the one represented in the woodcut No.84,—there
are also indications of a tetrastyle hall or gate having existed on its
summit,—while that to the west is much simpler.The hall itself had a
portico of 12 columns, and on each side a range of smaller apartments,
the two principal of which had their roof supported by 4 pillars each.The building is one of great beauty in itself, but its greatest value is
that it enables us to understand the arrangement of the great hall of
Xerxes—the Chehil Minar—the most splendid building of which any remains
exist in this part of the world.94)
it will be seen that the arrangement of the whole central part is
identical with that of the building just described.There can be no
possible doubt about this, as the bases of all the 72 columns still
exist in situ, as well as the jambs of the two principal doorways, which
are shaded darker in the plan.The side and rear walls only are restored
from the preceding illustration.The only difference is, that instead of
the two distyle halls on either side, this had hexastyle porticoes of 12
pillars each, similar to that in front; the angles between which were in
all probability filled up with rooms or buildings, as suggested in the
plan.[95]

[Illustration: 94.Restored Plan of Great Hall of Xerxes at Persepolis.Two orders of pillars were employed to support the roof of this splendid
building; one, represented in Woodcut No.91, with double bull capitals,
like those of the porch of Darius’s palace.in
height from the floor to the back of the bull’s neck, or 64 ft.to the
under side of the beam that lay between the bulls.The other order, with
the Ionic volutes (woodcut No.96), was also that employed in the
northern portico, and generally in the interior throughout this
building, and is nearly identical, as far as the base and shaft are
concerned, except in the height of the latter.The capital, however,
differs widely, and is 16 ft.in height, making an order
altogether 9 ft.less than that used externally, the difference
being made up by brackets of wood, which supported the beams of the
roof, internally at least, though externally the double bull capital
probably surmounted these Ionic-like scrolls.There is no reason to doubt that these halls also had platforms or
talars like the smaller halls, which would also serve to shelter any
opening in the roof, though in the present instance it seems very
doubtful if any such openings or skylights existed or were indeed
required.Thus arranged, the section of the buildings would be as shown in the
woodcut (No.97); and presuming this structure to have been sculptured
and painted as richly as others of its age and class, which it no doubt
was, it must have been not only one of the largest, but one of the most
splendid buildings of antiquity.In plan it was a rectangle of about 300
ft.by 350, and consequently covered 105,000 square ft.; it was thus
larger than the hypostyle hall at Karnac, or any of the largest temples
of Greece or Rome.It is larger, too, than any mediæval cathedral except
that of Milan; and although it has neither the stone roof of a
cathedral, nor the massiveness of an Egyptian building, still its size
and proportions, combined with the lightness of its architecture and the
beauty of its decorations, must have made it one of the most beautiful
buildings ever erected.Both in design and proportion it far surpassed
those of Assyria, and though possessing much of detail or ornament that
was almost identical, its arrangement and proportions were so superior
in every respect that no similar building in Nineveh can be compared
with this, the great architectural creation of the Persian Empire.There is no octastyle hall at Persepolis, and only one decastyle.In
this instance the hall itself measured about 225 ft.each way, and had
100 pillars on its floor; still, it was low in proportion, devoid of
lateral porticoes, and consequently by no means so magnificent a
building as the great hall of Xerxes.The portico in front was two
ranges in depth, and flanked by gigantic bulls; but as the whole height
was barely 25 ft., it could not have been a remarkable or pleasing
object.The sculptures on the jambs of the doorways are the most
interesting part of this building; these represent the king on his
throne, and various mythological subjects, on a more extensive scale
than those similarly situated in the other buildings of the platform.Indeed, it is probable that in the other palaces these subjects were
painted on the internal walls, as was done in those Assyrian halls which
were not revêted with slabs.With an appropriateness that cannot be too
much praised, sculpture seems always to have been used in parts of the
building exposed to atmospheric injury, and, because of the exposure, to
have been employed there in preference to painting.Besides these buildings on the platform there are the remains of several
others on the plain, and within the precincts of the town of Istakr is a
building still called the Hareem of Jemsheed, and which may in reality
have been the residence of the Achæmenian kings.It certainly belongs to
their age, and from the irregularity of its form, and its general
proportions, looks very much more like a residence, properly so called,
than any of the monumental erections on the neighbouring platform of
Persepolis.Looked at from an architectural point of view the principal defect of
the interior arrangement, especially of the smaller Persepolitan halls,
is that their floor is unnecessarily crowded with pillars.As these had
to support only a wooden roof, some might have been dispensed with, or a
more artistic arrangement have been adopted.This would no doubt have
been done but for the influence of the Assyrian style, in which frequent
pillars were indispensable to support the heavy flat roofs, and as they
were of timber a greater number were required than would have been the
case if of stone.Those of wood also looked less cumbersome and less in
the way than those made of more durable materials.It is also a defect that the capitals of the pillars retain at
Persepolis so much of the form of their wooden prototypes.In wood such
capitals as those depicted (Woodcuts No.In stone they are clumsy; and the Greeks showed their usual
discrimination when they cut away all the volutes but one pair and
adopted a stone construction for the entablature.Notwithstanding these defects, there is a grandeur of conception about
the Persepolitan halls which entitles them to our admiration.Their
greatest point of interest to the architectural student consists
probably in their being examples of a transition from a wooden to a
stone style of art, and in their enabling us to complete and understand
that art which had been elaborated in the valley of the Euphrates during
previous centuries; but which, owing to the perishable nature of the
materials employed, has almost wholly passed away, without leaving
sufficient traces to enable all its characteristics to be understood or
restored.Loftus at Susa in 1850 laid bare the foundations
of a palace almost identical both in plan and dimensions with the Chehil
Minar at Persepolis.It was, however, much more completely ruined, the
place having long been used as a quarry by the inhabitants of the
neighbouring plains, so that now only the bases of the pillars remain in
situ, with fragments of the shafts and capitals strewed everywhere
about, but no walls or doorways, or other architectural members to
enable us to supply what is wanting at Persepolis.Restored Elevation of Capital at Susa.The bases seem to be of the same form and style as those at Persepolis,
but rather more richly carved.The capitals are also more elaborate, but
more essentially wooden in their form, and betray their origin not only
in the exuberance of their carving but also in the disproportion of the
capital to the shaft.In wood so large a capital does not look
disproportioned to so slender a shaft; in stone the effect is most
disagreeable, and was to a certain extent remedied at Persepolis so soon
as the result was perceived.Whether the Persians would ever have been
able to shake off entirely the wooden original is not quite clear, but
the Greeks, being bound by no such association, cut the knot at once,
and saved them the trouble.In 1885, M. Marcel Dieulafoy turned his attention to the excavations as
left by Loftus, and conceiving the idea that the principal entrance
should be sought for on the south side of the palace, he cut his
trenches in a north-east direction and discovered the traces of the
walls enclosing the court in front of the palace.These walls were faced
with enamelled beton blocks.Portions of these enamels had disappeared,
but sufficient remained, as the walls had fallen on their faces, to
allow of their being placed in their relative positions.From these
fragments M. Dieulafoy was able to put together a frieze of lions not
dissimilar to those found in the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad, with
decorative borders above and below, the whole crowned by a battlement,
also in enamelled colours.The lower portion of the wall was covered
with unglazed bricks of two colours, red and white, arranged in diaper
patterns.Continuing the trench, M. Dieulafoy discovered the great
staircase placed at the south side of the tumulus, a staircase of even
greater dimensions than the well-known example of Persepolis.Loftus’s researches had already proved that the palace consisted of a
central hall of thirty-six columns, with three porticoes of twelve
columns, similar, therefore, to the great hall of Xerxes.M. Dieulafoy’s
discoveries have shown that the central hall was enclosed with a wall,
thus confirming the late Mr.Fergusson’s theory as to the restoration of
the palace of Xerxes (see p.On the east side leading to the royal
entrance of the great hall, M. Dieulafoy discovered the remains of the
great frieze of archers (Woodcut No.99), now in the Louvre; these were
executed in bright enamelled colours on beton bricks.The figures, which
are about 5 ft.in height, are modelled in low relief, arrayed in
processional order, each man grasping a lance in his hand and carrying,
slung on his shoulder, a bow and quiver full of arrows.The shape of
each man’s dress is the same, but the colours and patterns alternate; in
one case the dress is studded with rosettes, in the other with squares
containing the earliest heraldic device known, a representation of three
towers on a hill.These enamels, as also those of the lions and of fragments of the
crenelated staircase, are now all in the Louvre, and retain sufficient
of their pristine effect to suggest a scheme of colour and of decorative
treatment of the greatest beauty.[96] The inscriptions round the bases
of the pillars had already informed us that the hall was erected by
Darius and Xerxes, but repaired and restored by Artaxerxes Mnemon, who
added the inscriptions.This has been confirmed by another inscription
under the lions on the pylons; these M. Dieulafoy attributes to Xerxes,
as fragments of enamelled bricks of burnt clay, and not beton, and
therefore of an earlier building, have been utilised as a filling-in.In
all probability the hall of this palace is the identical hall in which
the scenes described in the Book of Esther took place.The foundations
of other parts of this palace might be no doubt laid bare by further
excavations; but the ruin of the place has been so complete, that little
of interest in an architectural point of view can be looked for.Below
these Persian ruins are probably buried the remains of long-preceding
dynasties, which deeper excavations would lay bare, and which would in
all probability afford a rich harvest to the historical explorer.Near the town of Istakr, and opposite the tombs of Naksh-i-Rustam,
stands a small tower-like building, represented in Woodcut No.The
lower part is solid; the upper contains a small square apartment, roofed
by two great flat slabs of stone.Access to this chamber is obtained by
a doorway situated at some distance from the ground.Both the traditions of the place and the knowledge we have of their
religious practices point to this as one of the fire temples of the
ancient Persians.Its roof is internally still black, probably with the
smoke of ancient fires, and though simple and insignificant as an
architectural monument, it is interesting as the only form of a temple
apart from regal state which the ancient Persians possessed.Another, almost identical in form, is found at Pasargadæ,[97] and a
third exists (according to Stolze) near Maubandajan, at the foot of the
Kuh Pir-i-mard, eleven miles to east of Fasa.Perrot suggests it may
have been the tomb of Hytaspes, father of Darius.The celebrated Kaabah
at Mecca, to which all the Moslem world now bow in prayer, is probably a
fourth, while the temple represented in Woodcut No.81, from Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone, may be a representation of such a structure as
these, with its curtains and paraphernalia complete.It is too evident,
however, that the Persians were not a temple-building people,[98] and
the examples that have come down to our time are too few and too
insignificant on which to found any theory.Little requires to be said of the tombs of the Persians; that of Darius
is represented in plan and elevation in Woodcut No.92, and, as before
remarked, it is a literal copy on the rock of the façade of his palace.Internally, three small cells contained the remains of the king, with
those of the persons, probably his favourite wife or wives for whom he
had destined that honour.Close by this, at Naksh-i-Rustam, are four
others, and in the rock behind Persepolis are three more tombs of the
Achæmenian kings, identical with these in all essential respects; but
still with such a difference in workmanship and detail as would enable a
careful architectural student easily to detect a sequence, and so affix
to each, approximately at least, the name of the king whose sepulchre it
is.Unfortunately, that of Darius only is inscribed; but his position in
the dynasty is so well known, that, starting from that point, it would
be easy to assign each of these tombs to the king who excavated it for
his own resting-place.Although these tombs of the Achæmenians are not remarkable for their
magnificence, they are interesting in an architectural point of view,
inasmuch as—as pointed out above—they enable us to restore their
structural buildings in a manner we would hardly be able to do without
their assistance.They are also interesting ethnographically as
indicating that these kings of Persia were far from being the pure
Aryans the language of their inscriptions would lead us to suspect they
might be.There are not, so far as is yet known, any series of rock-cut
sepulchres belonging to any dynasty of pure Aryan blood.Nor would any
king of Semitic race attempt anything of the sort.Their evidence,
therefore, as far as it goes—and it is tolerably distinct—seems to prove
that the Achæmenian kings were of Turanian race.They only, and not any
of their subjects in Persia, seem to have adopted this style of
grandeur, which, as we shall presently see, was common in Asia Minor,
and other countries subject to their sway, but who were of a different
race altogether.CHAPTER V.

                         INVENTION OF THE ARCH.Before leaving this early section of architecture, it may be as well
briefly to refer to the invention of the true arch, regarding which
considerable misconception still exists.It is generally supposed that the Egyptians were ignorant of the true
principles of the arch, and only employed two stones meeting one another
at a certain angle in the centre when they wished to cover a larger
space than could conveniently be done by a single block.This, however,
seems to be a mistake, as many of the tombs and chambers around the
pyramids and the temples at Thebes are roofed by stone and brick arches
of a semicircular form, and perfect in every respect as far as the
principles of the arch are concerned.Several of these have been drawn by Lepsius, and are engraved in his
work; but, as no text accompanies them, and the drawings are not on a
sufficient scale to make out the hieroglyphics, where any exist, their
date cannot now be ascertained.Consequently, these examples cannot yet
be used as the foundation of any argument on the subject, though the
curved form of the roofs in the Third Pyramid would alone be sufficient
to render it more than probable that during the period of the 4th
dynasty the Egyptians were familiar with this expedient.[99]

At Beni-Hasan, during the time of the 12th dynasty, curvilinear forms
reappear in the roofs (Woodcut No.16), used in such a manner as to
render it almost certain that they are copied from roofs of arcuate
construction.Behind the Rameseum at Thebes there are a series of arches
in brick, which seem undoubtedly to belong to the same age as the
building itself; and Sir G. Wilkinson mentions a tomb at Thebes, the
roof of which is vaulted with bricks, and still bears the name of
Amenoph I., of the 18th dynasty.[100]

The temple at Abydus, erected by Rameses II., shows the same peculiarity
as the tombs at Beni-Hasan, of a flat segmental arch thrown across
between the stone architraves.In this instance it is also a copy in
stone, but such as must have been originally copied from one of brick
construction.There is also every reason to believe that the apartments
of the little pavilion at Medeenet Habû (Woodcuts Nos.32 and 33) were
covered with semicircular vaults, though these have now
disappeared.Hoskins found stone arches vaulting the roofs of the
porches to the pyramids, perfect in construction, and, what is still
more singular, showing both circular and pointed forms (Woodcut No.These, as before remarked, are probably of the time of Tirhakah,
or at all events not earlier than the age of Solomon, nor later than
that of Cambyses.Section of Tomb near the Pyramids of Gizeh.]In the age of Psammeticus we have several stone arches in the
neighbourhood of the pyramids; one, in a tomb at Sakkara, has been
frequently drawn; but one of the most instructive is that in a tomb
discovered by Colonel Campbell (Woodcut No.101), showing a very
primitive form of an arch composed of 3 stones only, and above which is
another arch of regular construction of 4 courses.In his researches at
Nimroud, Layard discovered vaulted drains and chambers below the
north-west and south-east edifices, which were consequently as old as
the 8th or 9th century before our era, and contemporary with those in
the pyramids of Meroë.They were of both circular and pointed forms, and
built apparently with great care and attention to the principles of the
arch (Woodcut No.Vaulted Drain beneath the South-East Palace at
Nimroud.]The great discovery of this class is that of the city gates at
Khorsabad, which, as mentioned at p.181, were spanned by arches of
semicircular form, so perfect both in construction and in the mode in
which they were ornamented, as to prove that in the time of Sargon the
arch was a usual and well-understood building expedient, and one
consequently which we may fairly assume to have been long in use.Arch at Dêr-el-Bahree.On the other hand, we have in the temple at Dêr-el-Bahree in Thebes,
built by Thothmes III., a curious example of the retention of the old
form, when at first sight it would appear as though the true arch would
have been a more correct expedient.In this example, the lower arch is
composed of stones bracketing forward horizontally, though the form of
the arch is semicircular; and above this is a discharging arch of two
stones used as in the Pyramids.The upper arch is so arranged as to
relieve the crown of the lower—which is its weakest part—of all weight,
and at the same time to throw the whole pressure on the outer ends of
the arch stones, exactly where it is wanted.The whole thus becomes
constructively perfect, though it is a more expensive way of attaining
the end desired than by an arch.The truth seems to be, the Egyptians had not at this age invented
voussoirs deeper in the direction of the radii of the arch than in that
of its perimeter; and the arch with them was consequently not generally
an appropriate mode of roofing.It was the Romans with their tiles who
first really understood the true employment of the arch.So far as we can now understand from the discoveries that have been
made, it seems that the Assyrians used the pointed arch for tunnels,
aqueducts, and generally for underground work where they feared great
superincumbent pressure on the apex, and the round arch above-ground
where that was not to be dreaded; and in this they probably showed more
science and discrimination than we do in such works.Arch of the Cloaca Maxima, Rome.In Europe the oldest arch is probably that of Cloaca Maxima at Rome,
constructed under the early kings.It is of stone in 3 rims, and shows
as perfect a knowledge of the principle as any subsequent example.Its
lasting uninjured to the present day proves how well the art was then
understood, and, by inference, how long it must have been practised
before reaching that degree of perfection.From all this it becomes almost certain that the arch was used as early
as the times of the pyramid-builders of the 4th dynasty, and was copied
in the tombs of Beni-Hasan in the 12th; though it may be that the
earliest existing example cannot be dated further back than the first
kings of the 18th dynasty; from that time, however, there can be no
doubt that it was currently used, not only in Egypt, but also in
Ethiopia and Assyria.It would, indeed, be more difficult to account for the fact of such
perfect builders as the Egyptians being ignorant of the arch if such
were the case; though, at the same time, it is easy to understand why
they should use it so sparingly, as they did in their monumental
erections.Even in the simplest arch, that formed of only two stones, such as is
frequently found in the pyramids, and over the highest chamber (Woodcut
No.8), it will be evident that any weight placed on the apex has a
tendency to lower the summit, and press the lower ends of the stones
outwards.Where there was the whole mass of the pyramid to abut against,
this was of no consequence, but in a slighter building it would have
thrust the walls apart, and brought on inevitable ruin.The introduction of a third stone, as in the arch (Woodcut No.101),
hardly remedied this at all, the central stone acting like a wedge to
thrust the two others apart; and even the introduction of 2 more stones,
making 5, as in Woodcut No.105, only distributed the pressure without
remedying the defect; and without the most perfect masonry every
additional joint was only an additional source of weakness.Arches in the Pyramids at Meroë.This has been felt by the architects of all ages and in all countries:
still, the advantage of being able to cover large spaces with small
stones or bricks is so great, that many have been willing to run the
risk; and all the ingenuity of the Gothic architects of the Middle Ages
was applied to overcoming the difficulty.But even the best of their
buildings are unstable from this cause, and require constant care and
attention to keep them from falling.The Indian architects have fallen into the other extreme, refusing to
use the arch under any circumstances, and preferring the smallest
dimensions and the most crowded interiors, to adopting what they
consider so destructive an expedient.As mentioned in the Introduction
(page 22), their theory is that “an arch never sleeps,” and is
constantly tending to tear a building to pieces: and, where aided by
earthquakes and the roots of trees, there is only too much truth in
their belief.The Egyptians seem to have followed a middle course, using arches either
in tombs, where the rock formed an immovable abutment; or in pyramids
and buildings, where the mass immensely overpowered the thrust; or
underground, where the superincumbent earth prevented movement.They seem also to have used flat segmental arches of brickwork between
the rows of massive architraves which they placed on their pillars; and
as all these abutted one another, like the arches of a bridge, except
the external ones, which were sufficiently supported by the massive
walls, the mode of construction was a sound one.This is exactly that
which we have re-introduced during the last 30 years, in consequence of
the application of cast-iron beams, between which flat segmental arches
of brick are thrown, when we desire to introduce a more solid and
fire-proof construction than is possible with wood only.In their use of the arch, as in everything else, the building science of
the Egyptians seems to have been governed by the soundest principles and
the most perfect knowledge of what was judicious and expedient, and what
should be avoided.Many of their smaller edifices have no doubt perished
from the scarcity of wood forcing the builders to employ brick arches,
but they wisely avoided the use of these in all their larger
monuments—in all, in fact, which they wished should endure to the latest
posterity.CHRONOLOGICAL MEMORANDA CONNECTED WITH ARCHITECTURE.Moses      B.C.1312

The Jews, like the other Semitic races, were not a building people, and
never aspired to monumental magnificence as a mode of perpetuating the
memory of their greatness.The palace of Solomon was wholly of cedar
wood, and must have perished of natural decay in a few centuries, if it
escaped fire and other accidents incident to such temporary structures.Their first temple was a tent, their second depended almost entirely on
its metallic ornaments for its splendour, and it was not till the Greeks
and Romans taught them how to apply stone and stone carving for this
purpose that we have anything that can be called architecture in the
true sense of the term.This deficiency of monuments is, however, by no means peculiar to the
Jewish people.As before observed, we should know hardly anything of the
architecture of Assyria but for the existence of the wainscot slabs of
their palaces, though they were nearly a purely Semitic people, but
their art rested on a Turanian basis.Neither Tyre nor Sidon have left
us a single monument; nor Utica nor Carthage one vestige that dates
anterior to the Roman period.What is found at Jerusalem, at Baalbec, at
Palmyra, or Petra, even in the countries beyond the Jordan, is all
Roman.What little traces of Phœnician art are picked up in the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean are copies, with Egyptian or
Grecian details, badly and unintelligently copied, and showing a want of
appreciation of the first principles of art that is remarkable in that
age.It is therefore an immense gain if by our knowledge of Assyrian art
we are enabled, even in a moderate degree, to realise the form of
buildings which have long ceased to exist, and are only known to us from
verbal descriptions.Diagram Plan of Solomon’s Palace.The most celebrated secular building of the Jews was the palace which
Solomon was occupied in building during the thirteen years which
followed his completion of the Temple.As not one vestige of this
celebrated building remains, and even its site is a matter of dispute,
the annexed plan must be taken only as an attempt to apply the knowledge
we have acquired in Assyria and Judea to the elucidation of the
descriptions of the Bible and Josephus,[102] and as such may be
considered of sufficient interest to deserve a place in the History of
Architecture.The principal apartment here, as in all Eastern palaces, was the great
audience hall, in this instance 150 feet in length by 75 in width; the
roof composed of cedar, and, like the Ninevite palaces, supported by
rows of cedar pillars on the floor.According to Josephus, who, however,
never saw it, and had evidently the Roman Stoa Basilica of the Temple in
his eye, the section would probably have been as shown in diagram A. But
the contemporary Bible narrative, which is the real authority, would
almost certainly point to something more like the Diagram B in the
annexed woodcut.Diagram Sections of the House of the Cedars of
Lebanon.]Next in importance to this was the Porch, which was the audience or
reception hall, attached to the private apartments; these two being the
Dewanni Aum and Dewanni Khas of Eastern palaces, at this day.The Hall
of Judgment we may venture to restore with confidence, from what we find
at Persepolis and Khorsabad; and the courts are arranged in the diagram
as they were found in Ninevite palaces.They are proportioned, so far as
we can now judge, to those parts of which the dimensions are given by
the authorities, and to the best estimate we can now make of what would
be most suitable to Solomon’s state, and to such a capital as Jerusalem
was at that time.From Josephus we learn that Solomon built the walls of this palace “with
stones 10 cubits in length, and wainscoted them with stones that were
sawed and were of great value, such as are dug out of the earth for the
ornaments of temples and the adornment of palaces.”[103] These were
ornamented with sculptures in three rows, but the fourth or upper row
was the most remarkable, being covered with foliage in relief, of the
most exquisite workmanship; above this the walls were plastered and
ornamented with paintings in colour: all of which is the exact
counterpart of what we find at Nineveh.From the knowledge we now possess of Assyrian palaces it might indeed be
possible to restore this building with fairly approximate correctness,
but it would hardly be worth while to attempt this except in a work
especially devoted to Jewish art.For the present it must suffice to
know that the affinities of the architecture of Solomon’s age were
certainly Assyrian; and from our knowledge of the one we may pretty
accurately realise the form of the other.TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM.Although not one stone remains upon another of the celebrated Temple of
Jerusalem, still, the descriptions in the Bible and Josephus are so
precise, that now that we are able to interpret them by the light of
other buildings, its history can be written with very tolerable
certainty.The earliest temple of the Jews was the Tabernacle, the plan of which
they always considered as divinely revealed to them through Moses in the
desert of Sinai, and from which they consequently never departed in any
subsequent erections.Its dimensions were for the cella, or Holy of
Holies, 10 cubits or 15 ft.cube; for the outer temple, two such cubes
or 15 ft.These were covered by the sloping roofs of the tent,
which extended 5 cubits in every direction beyond the temple itself,
making the whole 40 cubits or 60 ft.in length by 20 cubits or 30 ft.These stood within an enclosure 100 cubits long by 50 cubits
wide.[104]

[Illustration: 108.The Tabernacle, showing one half ground plan and one
half as covered by the curtains.]1015) built the Temple, he did not alter the
disposition in any manner, but adopted it literally, only doubling every
dimension.Thus the Holy of Holies became a cube of 20 cubits; the Holy
place, 20 by 40; the porch and the chambers which surrounded it 10
cubits each, making a total of 80 cubits or 120 ft.by 40 cubits or 60
ft., with a height of 30 as compared with 15, which was the height of
the ridge of the Tabernacle, and it was surrounded by a court the
dimensions of which were 200 cubits in length by 100 in width.Even with these increased dimensions the Temple was a very insignificant
building in size: the truth being that, like the temples of Semitic
nations, it was more in the character of a shrine or of a treasury
intended to contain certain precious works in metal.South-East View of the Tabernacle, as restored by
the Author.]The principal ornaments of its façade were two brazen pillars, Jachin
and Boaz, which seem to have been wonders of metal work, and regarding
which more has been written, and it may be added, more nonsense, than
regarding almost any other known architectural objects.The truth of the
matter appears to be that the translators of our Bibles in no instance
were architects, and none of the architects who have attempted the
restoration were learned as Hebrew scholars; and consequently the truth
has fallen to the ground between the two.A brazen pillar, however, 18
cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference—6 ft.in diameter—is an
absurdity that no brass-founder ever could have perpetrated.In the
Hebrew, the 15th verse reads: “He cast two pillars of brass, 18 cubits
was the height of the one pillar, and a line of 12 cubits encompassed
the other pillar.”[105] The truth of the matter seems to be that what
Solomon erected was a screen (chapiter) consisting of two parts, one 4
cubits, the other 5 cubits in height, and supported by two pillars of
metal, certainly not more than 1 cubit in diameter, and standing 12
cubits apart: nor does it seem difficult to perceive what purpose this
screen was designed to effect.As will be observed, in the restoration
of the Tabernacle (Woodcut No.109), the whole of the light to the
interior is admitted from the front.In the Temple the only light that
could penetrate to the Holy of Holies was from the front also; and
though the Holy place was partially lighted from the sides, its
principal source of light must have been through the eastern façade.In
consequence of this there must have been a large opening or window in
this front, and as a window was a thing that they had not yet learned to
make an ornamental feature in architectural design, they took this mode
of screening and partially, at least, hiding it.It becomes almost absolutely certain that this is the true solution of
the riddle, when we find that when Herod rebuilt the Temple in the first
century B.C., he erected a similar screen for the same purpose in front
of his Temple.Its dimensions, however, were one-third larger.It was 40
cubits high, and 20 cubits across, and it supported five beams instead
of two;[106] not to display the chequer-work and pomegranates of
Solomon’s screen, but to carry the Golden Vine, which was the principal
ornament of the façade of the Temple in its latest form.[107]

[Illustration: 110.Plan of Solomon’s Temple, showing the disposition of
the chambers in two storeys.]Although it is easy to understand how it was quite possible in metal
work to introduce all the ornaments enumerated in the Bible, and with
gilding and colour to make these objects of wonder, we have no examples
with which we can compare them, and any restoration must consequently be
somewhat fanciful.Still, we must recollect that this was the “bronze
age” of architecture.Homer tells us of the brazen house of Priam, and
the brazen palace of Alcinous; the Treasuries at Mycenæ were covered
internally with bronze plates; and in Etruscan tombs of this age metal
was far more essentially the material of decoration than carving in
stone, or any of the modes afterwards so frequently adopted.The altar
of the Temple was of brass.The molten sea, supported by twelve brazen
oxen; the bases, the lavers, and all the other objects in metal work,
were in reality what made the Temple so celebrated; and very little was
due to the mere masonry by which we should judge of a Christian church
or any modern building.No pillars are mentioned as supporting the roof, but every analogy
derived from Persian architecture, as well as the constructive
necessities of the case, would lead us to suppose they must have
existed, four in the sanctuary and eight in the pronaos.Plan of Temple at Jerusalem, as rebuilt by Herod.The temple which Ezekiel saw in a vision on the banks of the Chebar was
identical in dimensions with that of Solomon, in so far as naos and
pronaos were concerned.But a passage round the naos was introduced,
giving access to the chambers, which added 10 cubits to its dimensions
every way, making it 100 cubits by 60.The principal court, which
contained the Altar and the Temple properly so called, had the same
dimensions as in Solomon’s Temple; but he added, in imagination at
least, four courts, each 100 cubits or 150 ft.That on the east
certainly existed, and seems to have been the new court of Solomon’s
Temple,[108] and is what in that of Herod became the court of the
Gentiles.The north and south courts were never apparently carried out.They did not exist in Solomon’s Temple, and there is evidence to show
that they were not found in Zerubbabel’s.[109] That on the north-west
angle was the citadel of the Temple, where the treasures were kept, and
which was afterwards replaced by the Tower Antonia.View of the Temple from the East, as it appeared at
the time of the Crucifixion.When the Jews returned from the Captivity they rebuilt the Temple
exactly as it had been described by Ezekiel, in so far as dimensions are
concerned, except that, as just mentioned, they do not seem to have been
able to accomplish the northern and southern courts.The materials, however, were probably inferior to the original Temple;
and we hear nothing of brazen pillars in the porch, nor of the splendid
vessels and furniture which made the glory of Solomon’s Temple, so that
the Jews were probably justified in mourning over its comparative
insignificance.[110]

In the last Temple we have a perfect illustration of the mode in which
the architectural enterprises of that country were carried out.The
priests restored the Temple itself, not venturing to alter a single one
of its sacred dimensions, only adding wings to the façade so as to make
it 100 cubits wide, and it is said 100 cubits high, while the length
remained 100 cubits as before.[111] At this period, however, Judea was
under the sway of the Romans and under the influence of their ideas, and
the outer courts were added with a magnificence of which former builders
had no conception, but bore strongly the impress of the architectural
magnificence of the Romans.An area measuring 600 feet each way was enclosed by terraced walls of
the utmost lithic grandeur.On these were erected porticoes unsurpassed
by any we know of.One, the Stoa Basilica, had a section equal to that
of our largest cathedrals, and surpassed them all in length, and within
this colonnaded enclosure were ten great gateways, two of which were of
surpassing magnificence: the whole making up a rich and varied pile
worthy of the Roman love of architectural display, but in singular
contrast with the modest aspirations of a purely Semitic people.It is always extremely difficult to restore any building from mere
verbal description, and still more so when erected by a people of whose
architecture we know so little as we do of that of the Jews.Still, the
woodcut on the opposite page is probably not very far from representing
the Temple as it was after the last restoration by Herod, barring of
course the screen bearing the Vine mentioned above, which is omitted.Without attempting to justify every detail, it seems such a mixture of
Roman with Phœnician forms as might be expected and is warranted by
Josephus’s description.There is no feature for which authority could
not be quoted, but the difficulty is to know whether or not the example
adduced is the right one, or the one which bears most directly on the
subject.After all, perhaps, its principal defect is that it does not
(how can a modern restoration?)do justice to the grandeur and beauty of
the whole.Mary went back to the garden.As it has been necessary to anticipate the chronological sequence of
events in order not to separate the temples of the Jews from one
another, it may be as well before proceeding further to allude to
several temples similarly situated which apparently were originally
Semitic shrines but rebuilt in Roman times.That at Palmyra, for
instance, is a building very closely resembling that at Jerusalem, in so
far at least as the outer enclosure is concerned.[112] It consists of a
cloistered enclosure of somewhat larger dimensions, measuring externally
730 ft.by 715, with a small temple of an anomalous form in the centre.It wants, however, all the inner enclosures and curious substructures of
the Jewish fane; but this may have arisen from its having been rebuilt
in late Roman times, and consequently shorn of these peculiarities.It
is so similar, however, that it must be regarded as a cognate temple to
that at Jerusalem, though re-erected by a people of another race.A third temple, apparently very similar to these, is that of Kangovar in
Persia.[113] Only a portion now remains of the great court in which it
stood, and which was nearly of the same dimensions as those of Jerusalem
and Palmyra, being 660 ft.In the centre are the vestiges of a
small temple.At Aizaini in Asia Minor[114] is a fourth, with a similar
court; but here the temple is more important, and assumes more
distinctly the forms of a regular Roman peristylar temple of the usual
form, though still small and insignificant for so considerable an
enclosure.The mosque of Damascus was once one of these great square
temple-enclosures, with a small temple, properly so called, in the
centre.It may have been as magnificent, perhaps more so, than any of
these just enumerated, but it has been so altered by Christian and
Moslem rebuildings, that it is almost impossible now to make out what
its original form may have been.None of these are original buildings, but still, when put together and
compared the one with the other, and, above all, when examined by the
light which discoveries farther east have enabled us to throw on the
subject, they enable us to restore this style in something like its
pristine form.At present, it is true, they are but the scattered
fragments of an art of which it is feared no original specimens now
remain, and which can only therefore be recovered by induction from
similar cognate examples of other, though allied, styles of art.Historical notice—Tombs at Smyrna—Doganlu—Lycian tombs.It is now perhaps in vain to expect that any monuments of the most
ancient times, of great extent or of great architectural importance,
remain to be discovered in Asia Minor; still, it is a storehouse from
which much information may yet be gleaned, and whence we may expect the
solution of many dark historical problems, if ever they are to be solved
at all.Situated as that country is, in the very centre of the old world,
surrounded on three sides by navigable seas opening all the regions of
the world to her commerce, possessing splendid harbours, a rich soil,
and the finest climate of the whole earth, it must not only have been
inhabited at the earliest period of history, but must have risen to a
pitch of civilisation at a time preceding any written histories that we
possess.We may recollect that, in the time of Psammeticus, Phrygia
contended with Egypt for the palm of antiquity, and from the monuments
of the 18th dynasty we know what rich spoil, what beautiful vases of
gold, and other tributes of a rich and luxurious people, the Pout and
Roteno and other inhabitants of Asia Minor brought and laid at the feet
of Thothmes and other early kings eighteen centuries at least before the
Christian era.At a later period (716 to 547 B.C.)the Lydian empire was one of the
richest and most powerful in Asia; and contemporary with this and for a
long period subsequent to it, the Ionian colonies of Greece surpassed
the mother country in wealth and refinement, and almost rivalled her in
literature and art.Few cities of the ancient world surpassed Ephesus,
Sardis, or Halicarnassus in splendour; and Troy, Tarsus, and Trebisond
mark three great epochs in the history of Asia Minor which are
unsurpassed in interest and political importance by the retrospect of
any cities of the world.Excepting, however, the remains of the Greek
and Roman periods—the great temples of the first, and the great theatres
of the latter period—little that is architectural remains in this once
favoured land.It happens also unfortunately that there was no great
capital city—no central point—where we can look for monuments of
importance.The defect in the physical geography of the country is that
it has no great river running through it—no vast central plain capable
of supporting a population sufficiently great to overpower the rest and
to give unity to the whole.Elevation of Tumulus at Tantalais.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’) 100 ft.Plan and Section of Chamber in Tumulus at
Tantalais.]So far as our researches yet reach, it would seem that the oldest
remains still found in Asia Minor are the tumuli of Tantalais, on the
northern shore of the Gulf of Smyrna.They seem as if left there most
opportunely to authenticate the tradition of the Etruscans having sailed
from this port for Italy.One of these is represented in Woodcuts Nos.Though these tumuli are built wholly of stone, no one
familiar with architectural resemblances can fail to see in them a
common origin with those of Etruria.The stylobate, the sloping sides,
the inner chamber, with its pointed roof, all the arrangements, indeed,
are the same, and the whole character of the necropolis at Tantalais
would be as appropriate at Tarquinii or Cæræ as at Smyrna.Another tumulus of equal interest historically is that of Alyattes, near
Sardis, described with such care by Herodotus,[115] and which was
explored 35 years ago by Spiegelthal, the Prussian consul at
Smyrna.[116] According to the measurements of Herodotus, it was either
3800 or 4100 ft.in circumference; at present it is found to be 1180 ft.in diameter, and consequently about 3700 ft.in circumference at the top
of the basement, though of course considerably more below.It is
situated on the edge of a rocky ridge, which is made level on one side
by a terrace-wall of large stones, 60 ft.in height; above this the
mound rises to the height of 142 ft.: the total height above the plain
being 228 ft.The upper part of the mound is composed of alternate
layers of clay, loam, and a kind of rubble concrete.These support a
mass of brickwork, surmounted by a platform of masonry; on this one of
the steles described by Herodotus still lies, and one of the smaller
ones was found close by.The funereal chamber was discovered resting on the rock at about 160 ft.high; the roof flat and composed of large stones, on which
rested a layer of charcoal and ashes, 2 ft.in thickness, evidently the
remains of the offerings which had been made after the chamber was
closed, but before the mound had been raised over it.There are in the same locality an immense number of tumuli of various
dimensions, among which Herr Spiegelthal fancies he can discriminate
three classes, belonging to three distinct ages; that of Alyattes
belonging to the most modern.This is extremely probable, as at this
time (B.C.561) the fashion of erecting tumuli as monuments was dying
out in this part of the world, though it continued in less civilised
parts of Europe till long after the Christian era.The tumuli that still adorn the Plain of Troy are probably contemporary
with the oldest of the three groups of those around the Gygean Lake.Indeed, there does not seem much reason for doubting that they were
really raised over the ashes of the heroes who took part in that
memorable struggle, and whose names they still bear.The recent explorations of these mounds do not seem to have thrown much
light on the subject, but if we can trust the account Chevalier gives of
his researches at the end of the last century, the case is clear enough,
and there can be very little doubt but that the Dios Tepe on the Sigæan
promontory is really the tomb of Achilles.[117] Intensely interesting
though they are in other respects, Schliemann’s discoveries on the site
of Troy have done very little to increase our knowledge of the
architecture of the period.This may partly be owing to his ignorance of
the art, and to his having no architect with him, but it does not appear
that any architectural mouldings were discovered earlier than those of
“Ilium Novum,” two or three centuries before Christ.The so-called
Temple of Minerva was without pillars or mouldings of any sort, and the
walls and gates of the old city were equally devoid of ornament.What
was found seems to confirm the idea that the Trojans were a
Turanian-Pelasgic people burying their dead in mounds, and revelling in
barbaric splendour, but not having reached that degree of civilisation
which would induce them to seek to perpetuate their forms of art in more
permanent materials than earth and metals.[118]


It is not clear whether any other great groups of tumuli exist in Asia
Minor, but it seems more than probable that in the earliest times the
whole of this country was inhabited by a Pelasgic race, who were the
first known occupants of Greece, and who built the so-called Treasuries
of Mycenæ and Orchomenos, and who sent forth the Etruscans to civilise
Italy.If this be so, it accounts for the absence of architectural
remains, for they would have left behind them no buildings but the
sepulchres of their departed great ones; and if their history is to be
recovered, it must be sought for in the bowels of the earth, and not in
anything existing above-ground.Next to these in point of age and style comes a curious group of
rock-cut monuments, found in the centre of the land at Doganlu.They are
placed on the rocky side of a narrow valley, and are unconnected
apparently with any great city or centre of population.Generally they
are called tombs, but there are no chambers nor anything about them to
indicate a funereal purpose, and the inscriptions which accompany them
are not on the monuments themselves, nor do they refer to such a
destination.Altogether they are certainly among the most mysterious
remains of antiquity, and, beyond a certain similarity to the rock-cut
tombs around Persepolis, present no features that afford even a remote
analogy to other monuments which might guide us in our conjectures as to
the purpose for which they were designed.They are of a style of art
clearly indicating a wooden origin, and consist of a square
frontispiece, either carved into certain geometric shapes, or apparently
prepared for painting; at each side is a flat pilaster, and above a
pediment terminating in two scrolls.Some—apparently the more
modern—have pillars of a rude Doric order, and all indeed are much more
singular than beautiful.When more of the same class are discovered,
they may help us to some historic data: all that we can now advance is,
that, judging from the inscriptions on them and the traditions in
Herodotus, they would appear to belong to some race from Thessaly, or
thereabouts, who at some remote period crossed the Hellespont and
settled in their neighbourhood; they may be dated as far back as 1000,
and most probably 700 years at least before the Christian Era.Rock-cut Frontispiece at Doganlu.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’)]

There are other rock-cut sculptures farther east, at Pterium and
elsewhere; but all these are figure sculptures, without architectural
form or details, and therefore hardly coming within the limits of this
work.The only remaining important architectural group in Asia Minor is that
of Lycia, made known in this country since the year 1838, by the
investigations of Sir Charles Fellows and others.Interesting though
they certainly are, they are extremely disheartening to any one looking
for earlier remains in this land,—inasmuch as all of them, and more
especially the older ones, indicate distinctly a wooden origin—more
strongly perhaps than any architectural remains in the Western world.The oldest of them cannot well be carried farther back than the Persian
conquest of Cyrus and Harpagus.In other words, it seems perfectly
evident that up to that period the Lycians used only wood for their
buildings, and that it was only at that time, and probably from the
Greeks or Egyptians, that they, like the Persians themselves, first
learnt to substitute for their frail and perishable structures others of
a more durable material.As already observed, the same process can be traced in Egypt in the
earliest ages.In Central Asia the change was effected by the Persians.In India between the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.In Greece—in what was
not borrowed from the Egyptians—the change took place a little earlier
than in Lycia, or say in the 7th century B.C.What is important to
observe here is that, wherever the process can be detected, it is in
vain to look for earlier buildings.It is only in the infancy of stone
architecture that men adhere to wooden forms; and as soon as habit gives
them familiarity with the new material they abandon the incongruities of
the style, and we lose all trace of the original form, which never
reappears at an after age.All the original buildings of Lycia are tombs or monumental erections of
some kind, and generally may be classed under two heads, those having
curvilinear and those having rectilinear roofs, of both which classes
examples are found structural—or standing alone—as well as rock-cut.It consists
first of a double podium, which may have been in all cases, or at least
generally, of stone.Above this is a rectangular chest or sarcophagus,
certainly copied from a wooden form; all the mortises and framing, even
to the pins that held them together, being literally rendered in the
stonework.Above this is a curvilinear roof of pointed form, which also
is in all its parts a copy of an original in wood.The staves or bearers of the lower portion of the chest or sarcophagus
would suggest that the original feature was a portable ark, the upper
portion of which was framed in bamboo or some pliable wood tied together
by cross timbers or purlins which are carved on the principal front.A
somewhat similar scheme of construction is shown in the Chaityas of the
Buddhist temples, which are supposed to have been copies of wooden
structures not dissimilar to the Toda Mant huts which are built by the
Hindus down to the present day.[119]

[Illustration: 118.(From Forbes and Spratt’s
‘Lycia.’)]

[Illustration: 119.(From Sir Charles Fellows’s
work.)](From Texier’s ‘Asie
Mineure.’)]

When these forms are repeated in the rock the stylobate is omitted, and
only the upper part represented, as shown in the annexed woodcut (No.When the curvilinear roof is omitted, a flat one is substituted, nearly
similar to those common in the country at the present day, consisting of
beams of unsquared timber, laid side by side as close as they can be
laid, and over this a mass of concrete or clay, sufficiently thick to
prevent the rain from penetrating through.Sometimes this is surmounted
by a low pediment, and sometimes the lower framing also stands out from
the rock, so as to give the entrance of the tomb something of a
porchlike form.Both these forms are illustrated in the two woodcuts
(Nos.119 and 120), and numerous varieties of them are shown in the
works of Sir Charles Fellows and others, all containing the same
elements, and betraying most distinctly the wooden origin from which
they were derived.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

The last form that these buildings took was in the substitution of an
Ionic façade for these carpentry forms: this was not done apparently at
once, for, though the Ionic form was evidently borrowed from the
neighbouring Greek cities, it was only adopted by degrees, and even then
betrayed more strongly the wooden forms from which its entablature was
derived than is usually found in other or more purely Grecian examples.As soon as it had fairly gained a footing, the wooden style was
abandoned, and a masonry one substituted in its stead.The whole change
took place in this country probably within a century; but this is not a
fair test of the time such a process usually takes, as here it was
evidently done under foreign influence and with the spur given by the
example of a stone-building people.We have no knowledge of how long it
took in Egypt to effect the transformation.In India, where the form and
construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these
examples in Lycia, the process can be traced through five or six
centuries; and in Persia it took perhaps nearly as long to convert the
wooden designs of the Assyrians into even the imperfect stone
architecture of the Achæmenians.Even in their best and most perfect
buildings, however, much remained to be done before the carpentry types
were fairly got rid of and the style became entitled to rank among the
masonic arts of the world.The remaining ancient buildings of Asia Minor were all built by the
Greeks and Romans, each in their own style, so that their classification
and description belong properly to the chapters treating of the
architectural history of those nations, from which they cannot properly
be separated, although it is at the same time undoubtedly true that the
purely European forms of the art were considerably modified by the
influence on them of local Asiatic forms and feelings.The Ionic order,
for instance, which arose in the Grecian colonies on the coast, is only
the native style of this country Doricised, if the expression may be
used.In other words, the local method of building had become so
modified and altered by the Greeks in adapting it to the Doric, which
had become the typical style with them, as to cause the loss of almost
all its original Asiatic forms.It thus became essentially a stone
architecture with external columns, instead of a style indulging only in
wooden pillars, and those used internally, as there is every reason to
suppose was the earlier form of the art.The Ionic style, thus composed
of two elements, took the arrangement of the temples from the Doric, and
their details from the Asiatic original.The Roman temples, on the
contrary, which have been erected in this part of the world, in their
columns and other details exactly follow the buildings at Rome itself:
while, as in the instances above quoted of Jerusalem, Palmyra, Kangovar,
and others, the essential forms and arrangements are all local and
Asiatic.The former are Greek temples with Asiatic details, the latter
Asiatic temples with only Roman masonic forms.The Greeks, in fact, were
colonists, the Romans only conquerors; and hence the striking difference
in the style of Asiatic art executed under their respective influence.We shall have frequent occasion in the sequel to refer to this
difference.Though not strictly within the geographical limits of this chapter,
there is a group of tombs at Amrith—the ancient Marathos, on the coast
of Syria—which are too interesting to be passed over; but so exceptional
in the present state of our knowledge, that it is difficult to assign
them their proper place anywhere.The principal monument, represented in woodcut No.in height, composed of very large blocks of stone and situated over a
sepulchral cavern.There is no inscription or indication to enable us to
fix its date with certainty.[120] The details of its architecture might
be called Assyrian; but we know of nothing in that country that at all
resembles it.On the other hand there is a moulding on its base, which,
if correctly drawn, would appear to be of Roman origin; and there is a
look about the lions that would lead us to suspect they were carved
under Greek influence—after the age of Alexander at least.Elevation of the Monument and Section of the Tomb at
Amrith.[121])]

The interest consists in its being almost the only perfect survivor of a
class of monuments at one time probably very common; but which we are
led to believe from the style of ornamentation were generally in brick.It is also suggestive, from its close resemblance to the Buddhist topes
in Afghanistan and India; the tall form of those, especially in the
first-named country, and their universally domical outline, point
unmistakably to some such original as this: and lastly, were I asked to
point out the building in the old world which most resembled the stele
which Herod erected over the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem, in
expiation of his desecration of their sanctity,[122] this is the
monument to which I should unhesitatingly refer.(From
Wordsworth’s ‘Athens.’[123])]

Till within a very recent period the histories of Greece and Rome have
been considered as the ancient histories of the world; and even now, in
our universities and public schools, it is scarcely acknowledged that a
more ancient record has been read on the monuments of Egypt and dug out
of the bowels of the earth in Assyria.It is nevertheless true that the decipherment of the hieroglyphics on
the one hand, and the reading of the arrow-headed characters on the
other, have disclosed to us two forms of civilisation anterior to that
which reappeared in Greece in the 8th century before Christ.Based on
those that preceded it, the Hellenic form developed itself there with a
degree of perfection never before seen, nor has it, in its own peculiar
department, ever been since surpassed.These discoveries have been of the utmost importance, not only in
correcting our hitherto narrow views of ancient history, but in
assisting to explain much that was obscure, or utterly unintelligible,
in those histories with which we were more immediately familiar.We now,
for the first time, comprehend whence the Greeks obtained many of their
arts and much of their civilisation, and to what extent the character of
these was affected by the sources from which they were derived.Having already described the artistic forms of Egypt and Assyria, it is
not difficult to discover the origin of almost every idea, and of every
architectural feature, that was afterwards found in Greece.But even
with this assistance we should not be able to understand the phenomena
which Greek art presents to us, were it not that the monuments reveal to
us the existence of two distinct and separate races existing
contemporaneously in Greece.If the Greeks were as purely Aryan as their
language would lead us to believe, all our ethnographic theories are at
fault.But this is precisely one of those cases where archæology steps
in to supplement what philology tells us and to elucidate what that
science fails to reveal.That the language of the Greeks, with the
smallest possible admixture from other sources, is pure Aryan, no one
will dispute: but their arts, their religion, and frequently their
institutions, tend to ascribe to them an altogether different origin.Fortunately the ruins at Mycenæ and Orchomenos are sufficient to afford
us a key to the mystery.From them we learn that at the time of the war
of Troy a people were supreme in Greece who were not Hellenes, but who
were closely allied to the Etruscans and other tomb-building, art-loving
races.Whether they were purely Turanian, or merely ultra-Celtic, may be
questioned; but one thing seems clear, that this people were then known
to the ancients under the name of Pelasgi, and it is their presence in
Greece, mixed up with the more purely Dorian races, which explains what
would otherwise be unintelligible in Grecian civilisation.Except from our knowledge of the existence of a strong infusion of
Turanian blood into the veins of the Grecian people, it would be
impossible to understand how a people so purely Aryan in appearance came
to adopt a religion so essentially Anthropic and Ancestral.Their belief
in oracles, their worship of trees,[124] and many minor peculiarities,
were altogether abhorrent to the Aryan mind.The existence of these two antagonistic elements satisfactorily explains
how it was that while art was unknown in the purely Dorian city of
Sparta, it flourished so exuberantly in the quasi-Pelasgic city of
Athens; why the Dorians borrowed their architectural order from Egypt,
and hardly changed its form during the long period they employed it; and
how it came to pass that the eastern art of the Persians was brought
into Greece, and how it was there modified so essentially that we hardly
recognise the original in its altered and more perfect form.It
explains, too, how the different States of Greece were artistic or
matter-of-fact in the exact proportion in which either of the two
elements predominated in the people.Thus the poetry of Arcadia was unknown in the neighbouring State of
Sparta; but the Doric race there remained true to their institutions and
spread their colonies and their power farther than any other of the
little principalities of Greece.The institutions of Lycurgus could
never have been maintained in Athens; but, on the other hand, the
Parthenon was as impossible in the Lacedemonian State.Even in Athens
art would not have been the wonder that it became without that happy
admixture of the two races which then prevailed, mingling the common
sense of the one with the artistic feeling of the other, which tended to
produce the most brilliant intellectual development which has yet
dazzled the world with its splendour.The contemporary presence of these two races perhaps also explains how
Greek civilisation, though so wonderfully brilliant, passed so quickly
away.Had either race been pure, the Dorian institutions might have
lasted as long as the village-systems of India or the arts of Egypt or
China; but where two dissimilar races mix, the tendency is inevitably to
revert to the type of one, and, though the intermixture may produce a
stock more brilliant than either parent, the type is less permanent and
soon passes away.So soon was it the case, in this instance, that the
whole of the great history of Greece may be said to be comprehended in
the period ranging between the battle of Marathon (B.C.490) and the
peace concluded with Philip of Macedon by the Athenians (B.C.346): so
that the son of a man who was born before the first event may have been
a party to the second.All those wonders of patriotism, of poetry, and
art, for which Greece was famous, crowded into the short space of a
century and a half, is a phenomenon the like of which the world has not
seen before, and is not likely to witness again.As might be expected, from the length of time that has elapsed since the
Pelasgic races ruled in Greece, and owing to the numerous changes that
have taken place in that country since their day, their architectural
remains are few, and comparatively insignificant.It has thus come to
pass that, were it not for their tombs, their city walls, and their
works of civil engineering, such as bridges and tunnels—in which they
were pre-eminent—we should hardly now possess any material remains to
prove their existence or mark the degree of civilisation to which they
had reached.Section and Plan of Tomb of Atreus at Mycenæ.The most remarkable of these remains are the tombs of the kings of
Mycenæ, a city which in Homeric times had a fair title to be considered
the capital of Greece, or at all events to be considered one of the most
important of her cities.The Dorians described these as treasuries, from
the number of precious objects found in them, as in the tombs of the
Etruscans, and because they looked upon such halls as far more than
sufficient for the narrow dwellings of the dead.The most perfect and
the largest of them now existing is known as the Treasury or Tomb of
Atreus at Mycenæ, shown in plan and section in the annexed woodcut.The
principal chamber is 48 ft.in diameter, and is, or was when
perfect, of the shape of a regular equilateral pointed arch, a form well
adapted to the mode of construction, which is that of horizontal layers
of stones, projecting the one beyond the other, till one small stone
closed the whole, and made the vault complete.As will be explained further on, this was the form of dome adopted by
the Jaina architects in India.It prevailed also in Italy and Asia Minor
wherever a Pelasgic race is traced, down to the time when the pointed
form again came into use in the Middle Ages, though it was not then used
as a horizontal, but as a radiating arch.On one side of this hall is a chamber cut in the rock, the true
sepulchre apparently, and externally is a long passage leading to a
doorway, which, judging from the fragments that remain (Woodcut No.125), must have been of a purely Asiatic form of art, and very unlike
anything found subsequent to this period in Greece.Fragment of Pillar in front of Tomb of Atreus at
Mycenæ.]To all appearance the dome was lined internally with plates of brass or
bronze, some nails of which metals are now found there; and the holes in
which the nails were inserted are still to be seen all over the place.A
second tomb or treasury of smaller dimensions was discovered by Dr.Another of these tombs, erected by Minyas at
Orchomenos, described by Pausanias as one of the wonders of Greece,[125]
seems from the remains still existing to have been at least 20 ft.wider
than this one, and proportionably larger in every respect.All these
were covered with earth, and some are probably still hidden which a
diligent search might reveal.Schliemann’s discoveries in
the Acropolis of Mycenæ and in the Troad prove that it is still possible
to discover an unrifled tomb even in Greece.As domes constructed on the horizontal principle, these three are the
largest of which we have any knowledge, though there does not appear to
be any reasonable limit to the extent to which such a form of building
might be carried.When backed by earth,[126] as these were, it is
evident, from the mode of construction, that they cannot be destroyed by
any equable pressure exerted from the exterior.The only danger to be feared is, what is technically called a rising of
the haunches; and to avoid this it might be necessary, where large domes
were attempted, to adopt a form more nearly conical than that used at
Mycenæ.This might be a less pleasing architectural feature, but it is
constructively a better one than the form of the radiating domes we
generally employ.It is certainly to be regretted that more of the decorative features of
this early style have not been discovered.They differ so entirely from
anything else in Greece, and are so purely Asiatic in form, that it
would be exceedingly interesting to be able to restore a complete
decoration of any sort.In all the parts hitherto brought to light, an
Ionic-like scroll is repeated in every part and over every detail,
rather rudely executed, but probably originally heightened by colour.Its counterparts are found in Assyria and at Persepolis, but nowhere
else in Greece.[127]

[Illustration: 126.(From Dodwell’s ‘Greece.’)]

The Pelasgic races soon learnt to adopt for their doorways the more
pleasing curvilinear form with which they were already familiar from
their interiors.126) from a
gateway at Thoricus, in Attica, serves to show its simplest and earliest
form; and the illustration (Woodcut No.129) from Assos, in Asia Minor,
of a far more modern date, shows the most complicated form it took in
ancient times.In this last instance it is merely a discharging arch,
and so little fitted for the purpose to which it is applied, that we can
only suppose that its adoption arose from a strong predilection for this
shape.Another illustration of Pelasgic masonry is found at Delos (Woodcut No.127), consisting of a roof formed by two arch stones, at a certain angle
to one another, similar to the plan adopted in Egypt, and is further
interesting as being associated with capitals of pillars formed of the
front part of bulls, as in Assyria, pointing again to the intimate
connection that existed between Greece and Asia at this early period of
the former’s history.(From Stuart’s ‘Athens.’)]

In all these instances it does not seem to have been so much want of
knowledge that led these early builders to adopt the horizontal in
preference to the radiating principle, as a conviction of its greater
durability, as well, perhaps, as a certain predilection for an ancient
mode.In the construction of their walls they adhered, as a mere matter of
taste, to forms which they must have known to be inferior to others.In
the example, for instance, of a wall in the Peloponnesus (woodcut No.128), we find the polygonal masonry of an earlier age actually placed
upon as perfect a specimen built in regular courses, or what is
technically called _ashlar_ work, as any to be found in Greece; and on
the other side of the gateway at Assos (Woodcut No.129) there exists a
semicircular arch, shown by the dotted lines, which is constructed
horizontally, and could only have been copied from a radiating arch.(From Blouet’s ‘Voyage en
Grèce.’)]

Their city walls are chiefly remarkable for the size of the blocks of
stone used and for the beauty with which their irregular joints and
courses are fitted into one another.Like most fortifications, they are
generally devoid of ornament, the only architectural features being the
openings.These are interesting, as showing the steps by which a
peculiar form of masonry was perfected, and which, in after ages, led to
important architectural results.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

One of the most primitive of these buildings is a nameless ruin existing
near Missolonghi (Woodcut No.In it the sides of the opening are
straight for the whole height, and, though making a very stable form of
opening, it is one to which it is extremely difficult to fit doors, or
to close by any known means.It was this difficulty that led to the next
expedient adopted of inserting a lintel at a certain height, and making
the jambs more perpendicular below, and more sloping above.This method
is already exemplified in the tomb of Atreus (Woodcut No.124), and in
the Gate of the Lions at Mycenæ (Woodcut No.131); but it is by no means
clear whether the pediments were always filled up with sculpture, as in
this instance, or left open.In the walls of a town they were probably
always closed, but left open in a chamber.In the gate at Mycenæ the two
lions stand against an altar[128] shaped like a pillar, of a form found
only in Lycia, in which the round ends of the timbers of the roof are
shown as if projecting into the frieze.These are slight remains, it must be confessed, from which to
reconstruct an art which had so much influence on the civilisation of
Greece; but they are sufficient for the archæologist, as the existence
of a few fossil fragments of the bones of an elephant or a tortoise
suffice to prove the pre-existence of those animals wherever they have
been found, and enable the palæontologist to reason upon them with
almost as much certainty as if he saw them in a menagerie.Nor is it
difficult to see why the remnants are so few.When Homer describes the
imaginary dwelling of Alcinous—which he meant to be typical of a perfect
palace in his day—he does not speak of its construction or solidity, nor
tell us how symmetrically it was arranged; but he is lavish of his
praise of its brazen walls, its golden doors with their silver posts and
lintels—just as the writers of the Books of Kings and Chronicles praise
the contemporary temple or palace of Solomon for similar metallic
splendour.The palace of Menelaus is described by the same author as full of brass
and gold, silver and ivory.It was resplendent as the sun and moon, and
appeared to the eye of Telemachus like the mansion of Jupiter himself.On the architecture of the early Greek palaces considerable light has
been thrown through the researches of the late Dr.Schliemann at Tiryns,
on his second visit in 1884, when he was accompanied by Dr.Dörpfield,
who measured and drew out the plan which is here reproduced (Woodcut No.The palace at Tiryns is assumed by Dr.Schliemann to have been
destroyed by fire in the 11th century B.C.It was built in the upper
citadel and faced the south.The citadel was entered through a propylæum
with outer and inner portico, both in antis.A second propylæum of
smaller dimensions on the south of the entrance court gave access to the
chief court of the palace; this court was surrounded by porticoes on
three sides, and on the fourth or south side, a vestibule consisting of
a portico-in-antis leading to an ante-chamber, and the megaron or men’s
hall.The ante-chamber was separated from the portico by three
folding-doors, hung on solid timber framing; a single door, probably
closed by a curtain only, led from the ante-chamber to the men’s hall,
measuring 48 ft.by 33 ft., the roof of which was supported on four
pillars or columns; a circle in the centre of these indicated probably
the hearth.There are various chambers on the west side, one of which,
the bath-room, measuring 13 ft.by 10 ft., had a floor consisting of a
gigantic block of limestone 2 ft.On
the east side of the men’s hall was a second court with vestibule or
south side leading to the women’s hall (thalamos), 24 ft.by 17 ft., and
various other rooms on the west side of it.To the south of the women’s
court was a third court which may be considered to be the court of
service, with a passage leading direct to the entrance propylon of the
citadel.The walls were built in rubble masonry and clay mortar (clay mixed with
straw or hay); the foundations were carried from 6 ft.The walls were protected externally; first by a layer of
clay of various thicknesses and then with a plaster of lime about half
an inch thick.The upper portions of the walls generally consisted of
sun-dried bricks, and in order to give greater strength to the walls,
beams laid on thin slabs of stone (to give a horizontal bed) were built
into the outer surface.Blocks of hard limestone or breccia were used
for all the steps and door cills.The exposed angles of the walls and
the responds or antæ[129] of the columns were built of stone in the
lower part and wood above (in Troy they were always in wood with a stone
base).Opinions differ as to the lighting of the halls; the smaller
chambers were probably lighted through the door, as in Pompeii; but the
men’s and women’s halls must either have received their light through
openings at the side under the roof, or by a raised lantern over the
hearth before referred to.No temples are mentioned by Homer, nor by any early writer; but the
funereal rites celebrated in honour of Patroclus, as described in the
XXIII.Book of the Iliad, and the mounds still existing on the Plains of
Troy, testify to the character of the people whose manners and customs
he was describing, and would alone be sufficient to convince us that,
except in their tombs, we should find little to commemorate their
previous existence.The subject is interesting, and deserves far more attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon it, and more space than can be devoted to it
here.Not only is this art the art of people who warred before Troy, but
our knowledge of it reveals to us a secret which otherwise might for
ever have remained a mystery.The religion of the Homeric poems is
essentially Anthropic and Ancestral—in other words, of Turanian origin,
with hardly a trace of Aryan feeling running through it.When we know
that the same was the case with the arts of those days, we feel that it
could not well be otherwise; but what most excites our wonder is the
power of the poet, whose song, describing the manners and feelings of an
extinct race, was so beautiful as to cause its adoption as a gospel by a
people of another race, tincturing their religion to the latest hour of
their existence.We have very little means of knowing how long this style of art lasted
in Greece.The treasury built by Myron king of Sicyon at Olympia about
650 B.C.seems to have been of this style, in so far as we can judge of
it by the description of Pausanias.[130] It consisted of two chambers,
one ornamented in the Doric, one in the Ionic style, not apparently with
pillars, but with that kind of decoration which appears at that period
to have been recognised as peculiar to each.But the entire decorations
seem to have been of brass, the weight of metal employed being recorded
in an inscription on the building.The earliest example of a Doric
temple that we know of—that of Corinth—would appear to belong to very
nearly the same age, so that the 7th century B.C.may probably be taken
as the period when the old Turanian form of Pelasgic art gave way before
the sterner and more perfect creations of a purer Hellenic design.Perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Hellenic history of
Greece commenced with the Olympiads (B.C.776), but before that kingdom
bloomed into perfection an older civilisation had passed away, leaving
little beyond a few tombs and works of public utility as records of its
prior existence.It left, however, an undying influence which can be
traced through every subsequent stage of Grecian history, which gave
form to that wonderful artistic development of art, the principal if not
the only cause of the unrivalled degree of perfection to which it
subsequently attained.B. Temple of Niké Apteros.E. Foundations of old Temple of Athena, sixth century B.C.
]The culminating period of the Pelasgic civilisation of Greece was at the
time of the war with Troy—the last great military event of that age, and
the one which seems to have closed the long and intimate connection of
the Greek Pelasgians with their cognate races in Asia.Sixty years later the irruption of the Thessalians, and twenty years
after that event the return of the Heracleidæ, closed, in a political
sense, that chapter in history, and gave rise to what may be styled the
Hellenic civilisation, which proved the great and true glory of Greece.Four centuries, however, elapsed, which may appropriately be called the
dark ages of Greece, before the new seed bore fruit, at least in so far
as art is concerned.These ages produced, it is true, the laws of
Lycurgus, a characteristic effort of a truly Aryan race, conferring as
they did on the people who made them that power of self-government, and
capacity for republican institutions, which gave them such stability at
home and so much power abroad, but which were as inimical to the softer
glories of the fine arts in Sparta as they have proved elsewhere.When, after this long night, architectural art reappeared, it was at
Corinth, under the Cypselidæ, a race of strongly-marked Asiatic
tendencies; but it had in the meantime undergone so great a
transformation as to well-nigh bewilder us.On its reappearance it was
no longer characterised by the elegant and ornate art of Mycenæ and the
cognate forms of Asiatic growth, but had assumed the rude, bold
proportions of Egyptian art, and with almost more than Egyptian
massiveness.DORIC TEMPLES IN GREECE.The age of the Doric temple at Corinth is not, it is true,
satisfactorily determined; but the balance of evidence would lead us to
believe that it belongs to the age of Cypselus, or about 650 B.C.The
pillars are less than four diameters in height, and the architrave—the
only part of the superstructure that now remains—is proportionately
heavy.It is, indeed, one of the most massive specimens of architecture
existing, more so than even the rock-cut prototype at Beni Hasan.As a
work of art, it fails from excess of strength, a fault common to most of
the efforts of a rude people, ignorant of the true resources of art, and
striving, by the expression of physical power alone, to attain its
objects.Next in age to this is the little temple at Ægina.[131] Its date, too,
is unknown, though, judging from the character of its sculpture, it
probably belongs to the middle of the sixth century before Christ.We know that Athens had a great temple on the Acropolis, contemporary
with these, and the frusta of its columns still remain, which, after its
destruction by the Persians, were built into the walls of the citadel.It is more than probable that all the principal cities of Greece had
temples commensurate with their dignity before the Persian War.Many of
these were destroyed during that struggle; but it also happened then, as
in France and England in the 12th and 13th centuries, that the old
temples were thought unworthy of the national greatness, and of that
feeling of exaltation arising from the successful result of the greatest
of their wars, so that almost all those which remained were pulled down
or rebuilt.The consequence is, that nearly all the great temples now
found in Greece were built in the forty or fifty years which succeeded
the defeat of the Persians at Salamis and Platæa.One of the oldest temples of this class is that best known as the
Theseion or Temple of Theseus at Athens, now recognised as the Temple of
Hephaistos mentioned in the “Attica” of Pausanias.By an analysis of the
architectural character of the Temple Dr.Dorpfield contends that it is
posterior to the Parthenon and not anterior, as is generally supposed.Of all the great temples, the best and most celebrated is the Parthenon,
the only octastyle Doric Temple in Greece, and in its own class
undoubtedly the most beautiful building in the world.It is true it has
neither the dimensions nor the wondrous expression of power and eternity
inherent in Egyptian temples, nor has it the variety and poetry of the
Gothic Cathedral; but for intellectual beauty, for perfection of
proportion, for beauty of detail, and for the exquisite perception of
the highest and most recondite principles of art ever applied to
architecture, it stands utterly and entirely alone and unrivalled—the
glory of Greece and a reproach to the rest of the world.Next in size and in beauty to this was the great hexastyle temple of
Jupiter at Olympia, finished two years later than the Parthenon.Its
dimensions were nearly the same, but having only six pillars in front
instead of eight, as in the Parthenon, the proportions were different,
this temple being 95 ft.by 230, the Parthenon 101 ft.The excavations at Olympia, undertaken at the cost of the German
Government in 1876, not only laid bare the site of the Temple of
Jupiter, of which the lower frusta of half the column, the lower
portions of the walls of cella and nearly the whole of the pavement was
found in situ; but led to the recovery of a great portion of the
sculptures which decorated the metopes and filled the pediments, so that
it is not only possible to restore the complete design of the temple
itself but to obtain a distinct idea of its sculptural decoration.The
foundations of other Doric temples were found; of the Temple of Hera,
which seems originally to have been a wooden structure, the wood being
gradually replaced by stone when from its decay it required
renewal.[132] This temple was coeval if not more ancient than that of
Zeus; the interior of the cella would seem to have been subdivided into
bays or niches inside, similar to those of the Temple at Bassæ; a third
hexastyle Doric temple, the Metroum, was also discovered, and many
buildings dating from the Roman occupation.To the same age belongs the exquisite little Temple of Apollo Epicurius
at Bassæ (47 ft.by 125), the Temple of Minerva at Sunium, the greater
temple at Rhamnus, the Propylæa at Athens, and indeed all that is
greatest and most beautiful in the architecture of Greece.The temple of
Ceres at Eleusis also was founded and designed at this period, but its
execution belongs to a later date.The temple at Assos, though not of any great size, is interesting on
account of its having had the outer face of the architrave sculptured in
relief, requiring therefore an architectural frame which was obtained by
leaving a raised fillet along the bottom.The temple was
hexastyle-peristyle with pronaos but no posticum.The date is assumed to
be about 470 B.C., or shortly after the battle of Mycale.[133]


                        DORIC TEMPLES IN SICILY.Owing probably to some local peculiarity, which we have not now the
means of explaining, the Dorian colonies of Sicily and Magna Græcia seem
to have possessed, in the days of their prosperity, a greater number of
temples, and certainly retain the traces of many more, than were or are
to be found in any of the great cities of the mother country.The one
city of Selinus alone possesses six, in two groups,—three in the citadel
and three in the city.Of these the oldest is the central one of the
first-named group.Angell
and Harris, indicate an age only slightly subsequent to the foundation
of the colony, B.C.636, and therefore probably nearly contemporary with
the example above mentioned at Corinth.The most modern is the great
octastyle temple, which seems to have been left unfinished at the time
of the destruction of the city by the Carthaginians, B.C.by 166, and was consequently very much larger than any
temple of its class in Greece.The remaining four range between these
dates, and therefore form a tolerably perfect chronometric series at
that time when the arts of Greece itself fail us.The inferiority,
however, of provincial art, as compared with that of Greece itself,
prevents us from applying such a test with too much confidence to the
real history of the art, though it is undoubtedly valuable as a
secondary illustration.At Agrigentum there are three Doric temples, two small hexastyles, whose
age may be about 500 to 480 B.C., and one great exceptional example,
differing in its arrangements from all the Grecian temples of the age.long by 173 broad, and consequently very
nearly the same as those of the great Temple of Selinus just alluded to.Its date is perfectly known, as it was commenced by Theron, B.C.480,
and left unfinished seventy-five years afterwards, when the city was
destroyed by the Carthaginians.At Syracuse there still exist the ruins of a very beautiful temple of
this age; and at Segesta are remains of another in a much more perfect
state.Pæstum, in Magna Græcia, boasts of the most magnificent group of temples
after that at Agrigentum.One is a very beautiful hexastyle, belonging
probably to the middle of the fifth century B.C., built in a bold and
very pure style of Doric architecture, and still retains the greater
part of its internal columnar arrangement.The other two are more modern, and are far less pure both in plan and in
detail, one having nine columns at each end, the central pillars of
which are meant to correspond with an internal range of pillars,
supporting the ridge of the roof.The other, though of a regular form,
is so modified by local peculiarities, so corrupt, in fact, as hardly to
deserve being ranked with the beautiful order which it most resembles.We have even fewer materials for the history of the Ionic order in
Greece than we have for that of the Doric.The recent discoveries in
Assyria have proved beyond a doubt that the Ionic was even more
essentially an introduction from Asia[134] than the Doric was from
Egypt: the only question is, when it was brought into Greece.My own
impression is, that it existed there in one form or another from the
earliest ages, but owing to its slenderer proportions, and the greater
quantity of wood used in its construction, the examples may have
perished, so that nothing is now known to exist which can lay claim to
even so great an antiquity as the Persian War.The oldest example, probably, was the temple on the Ilissus, now
destroyed, dating from about 484 B.C.; next to this is the little gem of
a temple dedicated to Niké Apteros, or the Wingless Victory, built about
fifteen years later, in front of the Propylæa at Athens.The last and
most perfect of all the examples of this order is the Erechtheium, on
the Acropolis; its date is apparently about 420 B.C., the great epoch of
Athenian art.Nowhere did the exquisite taste and skill of the Athenians
show themselves to greater advantage than here; for though every detail
of the order may be traced back to Nineveh or Persepolis, all are so
purified, so imbued with purely Grecian taste and feeling, that they
have become essential parts of a far more beautiful order than ever
existed in the land in which they had their origin.The largest, and perhaps the finest, of Grecian Ionic temples was that
built about a century afterwards at Tegea, in Arcadia—a regular
peripteral temple of considerable dimensions, but the existence of which
is now known only from the description of Pausanias.[135]

As in the case, however, of the Doric order, it is not in Greece itself
that we find either the greatest number of Ionic temples or those most
remarkable for size, but in the colonies in Asia Minor, and more
especially in Ionia, whence the order most properly takes its name.That an Ionic order existed in Asia Minor before the Persian War is
quite certain, but all examples perished in that memorable struggle; and
when it subsequently reappeared, the order had lost much of its purely
Asiatic character, and assumed certain forms and tendencies borrowed
from the simpler and purer Doric style.If any temple in the Asiatic Greek colonies escaped destruction in the
Persian wars, it was that of Juno at Samos.It is said to have been
built by Polycrates, and appears to have been of the Doric order.The
ruins now found there are of the Ionic order, 346 ft.by 190 ft., and
must have succeeded the first mentioned.The apparent archaisms in the
form of the bases, &c., which have misled antiquarians, are merely
Eastern forms retained in spite of Grecian influence.More remarkable even than this was the celebrated Temple of Diana at
Ephesus, said by Pliny to have been 425 ft.Recent
excavations on the site, however, carried out by Mr.T. Wood, prove that
these dimensions apply only to the platform on which it stood.The
temple itself, measured from the outside of the angle pillars, was only
348 ft.by 164, making the area 57,072 ft., or about the average
dimensions of our mediæval cathedrals.Besides these, there was a splendid decastyle temple, dedicated to
Apollo Didymæus, at Miletus, 156 ft.in length; an
octastyle at Sardis, 261 ft.; an exquisitely beautiful,
though small hexastyle, at Priene, 122 ft.; and another at
Teos, and smaller examples elsewhere, besides many others which have no
doubt perished.German explorations in Pergamon have brought to light the remains of the
Augustæum, a building consisting of two detached wings with columns of
the Ionic order resting on a lofty podium enriched with sculpture and
connected one with the other by a magnificent flight of steps, the whole
block measuring 125 ft.[136]


                          CORINTHIAN TEMPLES.The Corinthian order is as essentially borrowed from the bell-shaped
capitals of Egypt as the Doric is from their oldest pillars.Like
everything they touched, the Greeks soon rendered it their own by the
freedom and elegance with which they treated it.The acanthus-leaf with
which they adorned it is essentially Grecian, and we must suppose that
it had been used by them as an ornament, either in their metal or wood
work, long before they adopted it in stone as an architectural feature.As in everything else, however, the Greeks could not help betraying in
this also the Asiatic origin of their art, and the Egyptian order with
them was soon wedded to the Ionic, whose volutes became an essential
though subdued part of this order.It is in fact a composite order, made
up of the bell-shaped capitals of the Egyptians and the spiral of the
Assyrians, and adopted by the Greeks at a time when national
distinctions were rapidly disappearing, and when true and severer art
was giving place to love of variety.At that time also mere ornament and
carving were supplanting the purer class of forms and the higher
aspirations of sculpture with which the Greeks ornamented their temples
in their best days.In Greece the order does not appear to have been introduced, or at least
generally used, before the age of Alexander the Great; the oldest
authentic example, and also one of the most beautiful, being the
Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (B.C.335), which, notwithstanding the
smallness of its dimensions, is one of the most beautiful works of art
of the merely ornamental class to be found in any part of the world.A
simpler example, but by no means so beautiful, is that of the porticoes
of the small octagonal building commonly called the Tower of the Winds
at Athens.The largest example in Greece of the Corinthian order is the
Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.This, however, may almost be
called a Roman building, though on Grecian soil—having been commenced in
its present form under Antiochus Epiphanes, in the second century B.C.by the Roman architect Cossutius, and only finished by Hadrian, to whom
probably we may ascribe the greatest part of what now remains.by 354 ft., and from the number of its columns,
their size and their beauty, it must have been when complete the most
beautiful Corinthian temple of the ancient world.Judging, however, from some fragments found among the Ionic temples of
Asia Minor, it appears that the Corinthian order was introduced there
before we find any trace of it in Greece Proper.Indeed, _à priori_, we
might expect that its introduction into Greece was part of that reaction
which the elegant and luxurious Asiatics exercised on the severer and
more manly inhabitants of European Greece, and which was in fact the
main cause of their subjection, first to the Macedonians, and finally
beneath the iron yoke of Rome.As used by the Asiatics, it seems to have
arisen from the introduction of the bell-shaped capital of the
Egyptians, to which they applied the acanthus-leaf, sometimes in
conjunction with the honeysuckle ornament of the time, as in Woodcut No.135, and on other and later occasions together with the volutes of the
same order, the latter combination being the one which ultimately
prevailed and became the typical form of the Corinthian capital.DIMENSIONS OF GREEK TEMPLES.Although differing so essentially in plan, the general dimensions of the
larger temples of the Greeks were very similar to those of the mediæval
cathedrals, and although they never reached the altitude of their modern
rivals, their cubic dimensions were probably in about the same ratio of
proportion.The following table gives the approximate dimensions, rejecting
fractions, of the eight largest and best known examples:—

   Juno, at Samos         346 feet long 190 feet wide = 65,740 feet.Jupiter, at Agrigentum 360 feet long 173 feet wide = 62,280 feet.Apollo, at Branchidæ   362 feet long 168 feet wide = 60,816 feet.Diana, at Ephesus      348 feet long 164 feet wide = 57,072 feet.Jupiter, at Athens     354 feet long 135 feet wide = 47,790 feet.Didymæus, at Miletus   295 feet long 156 feet wide = 45,020 feet.Cybele, at Sardis      261 feet long 144 feet wide = 37,884 feet.Parthenon, at Athens   228 feet long 101 feet wide = 23,028 feet.There may be some slight discrepancies in this table from the figures
quoted elsewhere, and incorrectness arising from some of the temples
being measured on the lowest step and others, as the Parthenon, on the
highest; but it is sufficient for comparison, which is all that is
attempted in its compilation.The Doric was the order which the Greeks especially loved and cultivated
so as to make it most exclusively their own; and, as used in the
Parthenon, it certainly is as complete and as perfect an architectural
feature as any style can boast of.When first introduced from Egypt, it,
as before stated, partook of even more than Egyptian solidity, but by
degrees became attenuated to the weak and lean form of the Roman order
of the same name.136, 137, 138 illustrate the three stages
of progress from the oldest example at Corinth to the order as used in
the time of Philip at Delos, the intermediate being the culminating
point in the age of Pericles: the first is 4·47 diameters in height, the
next 6·025, the last 7·015; and if the table were filled up with all the
other examples, the gradual attenuation of the shaft would very nearly
give the relative date of the example.This fact is in itself sufficient
to refute the idea of the pillar being copied from a wooden post, as in
that case it would have been slenderer at first, and would gradually
have departed from the wooden form as the style advanced.[137] This is
the case in all carpentry styles.With the Doric order the contrary
takes place.The earlier the example the more unlike it is to any wooden
original.As the masons advanced in skill and power over their stone
material, it came more and more to resemble posts or pillars of wood.The fact appears to be that, either in Egypt or in early Greece, the
pillar was originally a pier of brickwork, or of rubble masonry,
supporting a wooden roof, of which the architraves, the triglyphs, and
the various parts of the cornice, all bore traces down to the latest
period.Even as ordinarily represented, or as copied in this country, there is a
degree of solidity combined with elegance in this order, and an
exquisite proportion of the parts to one another and to the work they
have to perform, that command the admiration of every person of taste;
but, as used in Greece, its beauty was very much enhanced by a number of
refinements whose existence was not suspected till lately, and even now
cannot be detected but by the most practised eye.The columns were at first assumed to be bounded by straight lines.It is
now found that they have an _entasis_, or convex profile, in the
Parthenon to the extent of 1/550 of the whole height, and are outlined
by a very delicate hyperbolic curve; it is true this can hardly be
detected by the eye in ordinary positions, but the want of it gives that
rigidity and poverty to the column which is observable in modern
examples.[138]

In like manner, the architrave in all temples was carried upwards so as
to form a very flat arch, just sufficient to correct the optical
delusion arising from the interference of the sloping lines of the
pediment.This, I believe, was common to all temples, but in the
Parthenon the curve was applied to the sides also, though from what
motive it is not so easy to detect.Another refinement was making all the columns <DW72> slightly inwards, so
as to give an idea of strength and support to the whole.Add to this,
that all the curved lines used were either hyperbolas or parabolas.With
one exception only, no circular line was employed, nor even an ellipse.Every part of the temple was also arranged with the most unbounded care
and accuracy, and every detail of the masonry was carried out with a
precision and beauty of execution which is almost unrivalled, and it may
be added that the material of the whole was the purest and best white
marble.All these delicate adjustments, this exquisite finish and
attention to even the smallest details, are well bestowed on a design in
itself simple, beautiful, and appropriate.They combine to render this
order, as found in the best Greek temples, as nearly faultless as any
work of art can possibly be, and such as we may dwell upon with the most
unmixed and unvarying satisfaction.The system of definite proportion which the Greeks employed in the
design of their temples, was another cause of the effect they produce
even on uneducated minds.It was not with them merely that the height
was equal to the width, or the length about twice the breadth; but every
part was proportioned to all those parts with which it was related, in
some such ratio as 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, 4 to 9, or 5 to 10, &c. As
the scheme advances these numbers become undesirably high.In this case
they reverted to some such simple ratios as 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and
so on.We do not yet quite understand the process of reasoning by which the
Greeks arrived at the laws which guided their practice in this respect;
but they evidently attached the utmost importance to it, and when the
ratio was determined upon, they set it out with such accuracy, that even
now the calculated and the measured dimensions seldom vary beyond such
minute fractions as can only be expressed in hundredths of an inch.Though the existence of such a system of ratios has long been suspected,
it is only recently that any measurements of Greek temples have been
made with sufficient accuracy to enable the matter to be properly
investigated and their existence proved.[139]

The ratios are in some instances so recondite, and the correlation of
the parts at first sight so apparently remote, that many would be
inclined to believe they were more fanciful than real.[140] It would,
however, be as reasonable in a person with no ear, or no musical
education, to object to the enjoyment of a complicated concerted piece
of music experienced by those differently situated, or to declare that
the pain musicians feel from a false note was mere affectation.The eyes
of the Greeks were as perfectly educated as our ears.They could
appreciate harmonies which are lost in us, and were offended at false
quantities which our duller senses fail to perceive.But in spite of
ourselves, we do feel the beauty of these harmonic relations, though we
hardly know why; and if educated to them, we might acquire what might
almost be considered a new sense.But be this as it may, there can be no
doubt but that a great deal of the beauty which all feel in
contemplating the architectural productions of the Greeks, arises from
causes such as these, which we are only now beginning to appreciate.To understand, however, the Doric order, we must not regard it as a
merely masonic form.Sculpture was always used, or intended to be used,
with it.The Metopes between the triglyphs, the pediments of the
porticoes, and the acroteria or pedestals on the roof, are all unmeaning
and useless unless filled or surmounted with sculptured figures.Sculpture is, indeed, as essential a part of this order as the
acanthus-leaves and ornaments of the cornice are to the capitals and
entablature of the Corinthian order; and without it, or without its
place being supplied by painting, we are merely looking at the dead
skeleton, the mere framework of the order, without the flesh and blood
that gave it life and purpose.It is when all these parts are combined together, as in the portico of
the Parthenon (Woodcut No.139), that we can understand this order in
all its perfection; for though each part was beautiful in itself, their
full value can be appreciated only as parts of a great whole.Another essential part of the order, too often overlooked, is the
colour, which was as integral a part of it as its form.Till very
lately, it was denied that Greek temples were, or could be, painted: the
unmistakable remains of colour, however, that have been discovered in
almost all temples, and the greater knowledge of the value and use of it
which now prevails, have altered public opinion very much on the matter,
and most people now admit that some colour was used, though few are
agreed as to the extent to which it was carried.It cannot now be questioned that colour was used everywhere internally,
and on every object.Externally too it is generally admitted that the
sculpture was painted and relieved by strongly <DW52> backgrounds; the
lacunaria, or recesses of the roof, were also certainly painted; and all
the architectural mouldings, which at a later period were carved in
relief, have been found to retain traces of their painted ornaments.It is disputed whether the echinus or carved moulding of the capital was
so ornamented.There seems little doubt but that it was; and that the
walls of the cells were also  throughout and covered with
paintings illustrative of the legends and attributes of the divinity to
whom the temple was dedicated or of the purposes for which it was
erected.The plane face of the architrave was probably left white, or
merely ornamented with metal shields or inscriptions, and the shafts of
the columns appear also to have been left plain, or merely slightly
stained to tone down the crudeness of the white marble.Generally
speaking, all those parts which from their form or position were in any
degree protected from the rain or atmospheric influences seem to have
been ; those particularly exposed, to have been left plain.To
whatever extent, however, painting may have been carried, these 
ornaments were as essential a part of the Doric order as the carved
ornaments were of the Corinthian, and made it, when perfect, a richer
and more ornamental, as it was a more solid and stable, order than the
latter.The colour nowhere interfered with the beauty of its forms, but
gave it that richness and amount of ornamentation which is indispensable
in all except the most colossal buildings, and a most valuable adjunct
even to them.The Ionic order, as we now find it, is not without some decided
advantages over the Doric.It is more complete in itself and less
dependent on sculpture.Its frieze was too small for much display of
human life and action, and was probably usually ornamented with lines of
animals,[141] like the friezes at Persepolis.But the frieze of the
little temple of Nikè Apteros is brilliantly ornamented in the same
style as those of the Doric order.It also happened that those details
and ornaments which were only painted in the Doric, were carved in the
Ionic order, and remain therefore visible to the present day, which
gives to this order a completeness in our eyes which the other cannot
boast of.Add to this a certain degree of Asiatic elegance and grace,
and the whole when put together makes up a singularly pleasing
architectural object.But notwithstanding these advantages, the Doric
order will probably always be admitted to be superior, as belonging to a
higher class of art, and because all its forms and details are better
and more adapted to their purpose than those of the Ionic.Ionic order of Erechtheium at Athens.]The principal characteristic of the Ionic order is the Pelasgic or
Asiatic spiral, here called a volute, which, notwithstanding its
elegance, forms at best but an awkward capital.The Assyrian honeysuckle
below this, carved as it is with the exquisite feeling and taste which a
Greek alone knew how to impart to such an object, forms as elegant an
architectural detail as is anywhere to be found; and whether used as the
necking of a column, or on the crowning member of a cornice, or on other
parts of the order, is everywhere the most beautiful ornament connected
with it.Comparing this order with that at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96),
the only truly Asiatic prototype we have of it, we see how much the
Doric feeling of the Greeks had done to sober it down, by abbreviating
the capital and omitting the greater part of the base.This process was
carried much farther when the order was used in conjunction with the
Doric, as in the Propylæa, than when used by itself, as in the
Erechtheium; still in every case all the parts found in the Asiatic
style are found in the Greek.The same form and feelings pervade both;
and, except in beauty of execution and detail, it is not quite clear how
far even the Greek order is an improvement on the Eastern one.The
Persepolitan base is certainly the more beautiful of the two; so are
many parts of the capital.The perfection of the whole, however, depends
on the mode in which it is employed; and it is perfectly evident that
the Persian order could not be combined with the Doric, nor applied with
much propriety as an external order, which was the essential use of all
the Grecian forms of pillars.Ionic order in Temple of Apollo at Bassæ.]Section of half of the Ionic Capital at Bassæ, taken
through the volute.]When used between antæ or square piers, as seems usually to have been
the case in Assyria, the two-fronted form of the Ionic capital was
appropriate and elegant; but when it was employed, as in the
Erechtheium, as an angle column, it presented a difficulty which even
Grecian skill and ingenuity could not quite conquer.When the Persians
wanted the capital to face four ways they turned the side outwards, as
at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96), and put the volutes in the angles—which
was at best but an awkward mode of getting over the difficulty.The instance in which these difficulties have been most successfully met
is in the internal order at Bassæ.There the three sides are equal, and
are equally seen—the fourth is attached to the wall—and the junction of
the faces is formed with an elegance that has never been surpassed.It
has not the richness of the order of the Erechtheium, but it excels it
in elegance.Its widely spreading base still retains traces of the
wooden origin of the order, and carries us back towards the times when a
shoe was necessary to support wooden posts on the floor of an Assyrian
hall.Notwithstanding the amount of carving which the Ionic order displays,
there can be little doubt of its having been also ornamented with colour
to a considerable extent, but probably in a different manner from the
Doric.My own impression is, that the carved parts were gilt, or picked
out with gold, relieved by  grounds, varied according to the
situation in which they were found.The existing remains prove that
colours were used in juxtaposition, to relieve and heighten the
architectural effect of the carved ornaments of this order.In the Ionic temples at Athens the same exquisite masonry was used as in
the Doric; the same mathematical precision and care is bestowed on the
entasis of the columns, the drawing of the volutes, and the execution of
even the minutest details; and much of its beauty and effect are no
doubt owing to this circumstance, which we miss so painfully in nearly
all modern examples.As before mentioned, the Corinthian order was only introduced into
Greece on the decline of art, and never rose during the purely Grecian
age to the dignity of a temple order.It most probably, however, was
used in the more ornate specimens of domestic architecture, and in
smaller works of art, long before any of those examples of it were
executed which we now find in Greece.Order of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.]The most typical specimen we now know is that of the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates (Woodcut No.143), which, notwithstanding all its elegance
of detail and execution, can hardly be pronounced to be perfect, the
Egyptian and Asiatic features being only very indifferently united to
one another.The foliaged part is rich and full, but is not carried up
into the upper or Ionic portion, which is, in comparison, lean and poor;
and though separately the two parts are irreproachable, it was left to
the Romans so to blend the two together as to make a perfectly
satisfactory whole out of them.In this example, as now existing, the junction of the column with the
capital is left a plain sinking, and so it is generally copied in modern
times; but there can be little doubt that this was originally filled by
a bronze wreath, which was probably gilt.Accordingly this is so
represented in the woodcut as being essential to the completion of the
order.The base and shaft have, like the upper part of the capital, more
Ionic feeling in them than the order was afterwards allowed to retain;
and altogether it is, as here practised, far more elegant, though less
complete, than the Roman form which superseded it.Order of the Tower of the Winds, Athens.]The other Athenian example, that of the Tower of the winds (Woodcut No.144), is remarkable as being almost purely Egyptian in its types, with
no Ionic admixture.The columns have no bases, the capitals no volutes,
and the water-leaf clings as closely to the bell as it does in the
Egyptian examples.The result altogether wants richness, and, though
appropriate on so small a scale, would hardly be pleasing on a larger.The great example of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius differs in no
essential part from the Roman order, except that the corners of the
abacus are not cut off; and that, being executed in Athens, there is a
degree of taste and art displayed in its execution which we do not find
in any Roman examples.Strictly speaking, however, it belongs to that
school, and should be enumerated as a Roman, and not as a Grecian,
example.Caryatide Figure in the British Museum.]It has been already explained that the Egyptians never used caryatide
figures, properly so called, to support the entablatures of their
architecture, their figures being always attached to the front of the
columns or piers, which were the real bearing mass.At Persepolis, and
elsewhere in the East, we find figures everywhere employed supporting
the throne or the platform of the palaces of the kings; not, indeed, on
their heads, as the Greeks used them, but rather in their uplifted
hands.The name, however, as well as their being only used in conjunction with
the Ionic order and with Ionic details, all point to an Asiatic origin
for this very questionable form of art.As employed in the little
Portico attached to the Erechtheium, these figures are used with so much
taste, and all the ornaments are so elegant, that it is difficult to
criticise or find fault; but it is nevertheless certain that it was a
mistake which even the art of the Greeks could hardly conceal.To use
human figures to support a cornice is unpardonable, unless it is done as
a mere secondary adjunct to a building.In the Erechtheium it is a
little too prominent for this, though used with as much discretion as
was perhaps possible under the circumstances.Another example of the
sort is shown in Woodcut No.146, which, by employing a taller cap,
avoids some of the objections to the other; but the figure itself, on
the other hand, is less architectural, and so errs on the other side.Caryatide Figure from the Erechtheium.]Another form of this class of support is that of the Giants or
_Telamones_, instances of which are found supporting the roof of the
great Temple at Agrigentum, and in the baths of the semi-Greek city of
Pompeii.As they do not actually bear the entablature, but only seem to
relieve the masonry behind them, their employment is less objectionable
than that of the female figures above described; but even they hardly
fulfil the conditions of true art, and their place might be better
filled by some more strictly architectural feature.The arrangements of Grecian Doric temples show almost less variety than
the forms of the pillars, and no materials exist for tracing their
gradual development in an historical point of view.The temples at
Corinth, and the oldest at Selinus, are both perfect examples of the
hexastyle arrangement to which the Greeks adhered in all ages; and
though there can be little doubt that the peripteral form, as well as
the order itself, was borrowed from Egypt, it still was so much modified
before it appeared in Greece, that it would be interesting, if it could
be done, to trace the several steps by which the change was effected.In an architectural point of view this is by no means difficult.The
simplest Greek temples were mere cells, or small square apartments
suited to contain an image—the front being what is technically called
_distyle in antis_, or with two pillars between _antæ_, or square
pilaster like piers terminating the side walls.Hence the interior
enclosure of Grecian temples is called the cell or cella, however large
and splendid it may be.The next change was to separate the interior into a cell and porch by a
wall with a large doorway in it, as in the small temple at Rhamnus
(Woodcut No.148), where the opening however can scarcely be called a
doorway, as it extends to the roof.A third change was to put a porch of
4 pillars in front of the last arrangement, or, as appears to have been
more usual, to bring forward the screen to the positions of the pillars
as in the last example, and to place the 4 pillars in front of this.None of these plans admitted of a peristyle, or pillars on the flanks.To obtain this it was necessary to increase the number of pillars of the
portico to 6, or, as it is termed, to make it hexastyle, the 2 outer
pillars being the first of a range of 13 or 15 columns, extended along
each side of the temple.The cell in this arrangement was a complete
temple in itself—distyle in antis, most frequently made so at both ends,
and the whole enclosed in its envelope of columns, as in Woodcut No.Sometimes the cell was tetrastyle or with four pillars in front.(From Hittorff,
‘Arch.Antique en Sicile.’) Scale 100 ft.In this form the Greek temple may be said to be complete, very few
exceptions occurring to the rule, though the Parthenon itself is one of
these few.It has an inner hexastyle portico at each end of the cell;
beyond these outwardly are octastyle porticoes, with 17 columns on each
flank.The great Temple at Selinus is also octastyle, but it is neither so
simple nor so beautiful in its arrangement; and, from the decline of
style in the art when it was built, is altogether an inferior example;
still, as one of the largest of Greek Doric temples, its plan is worthy
of being quoted as an illustration of the varying forms of these
temples.Another great exception is the great temple at Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.152 and 154), where the architect attempted an order on so gigantic a
scale that he was unable to construct the pillars with their architraves
standing free.The interstices of the columns are therefore built up
with walls pierced with windows, and altogether the architecture is so
bad, that even its colossal dimensions must have failed to render it at
any time a pleasing or satisfactory work of art.A fourth exception is the double temple at Pæstum, with 9 pillars in
front, a clumsy expedient, but which arose from its having a range of
columns down the centre to support the ridge of the roof by a simpler
mode than the triangular truss usually employed for carrying the roof
between two ranges of column.Plan of Great Temple at Agrigentum.With the exception of the temple at Agrigentum, all these were
peristylar, or had ranges of columns all around them, enclosing the cell
as it were in a case, an arrangement so apparently devoid of purpose,
that it is not at first sight easy to account for its universality.It
will not suffice to say that it was adopted merely because it was
beautiful, for the forms of Egyptian temples, which had no pillars
externally, were as perfect, and in the hands of the Greeks would have
become as beautiful, as the one they adopted.Besides, it is natural to
suppose they would rather have copied the larger than the smaller
temples, if no motive existed for their preference of the latter.The
peristyle, too, was ill suited for an ambulatory, or place for
processions to circulate round the temple; it was too narrow for this,
and too high to protect the procession from the rain.Indeed, I know of
no suggestion except that it may have been adopted to protect the
paintings on the walls of the cells from the inclemency of the weather.It hardly admits of a doubt that the walls were painted, and that
without protection of some sort this would very soon have been
obliterated.It seems also very evident that the peristyle was not only
practically, but artistically, most admirably adapted for this purpose.The paintings of the Greeks were, like those of the Egyptians, composed
of numerous detached groups, connected only by the story, and it almost
required the intervention of pillars, or some means of dividing into
compartments the surface to be so painted, to separate these groups from
one another, and to prevent the whole sequence from being seen at once;
while, on the other hand, nothing can have been more beautiful than the
white marble columns relieved against a richly  plane surface.The one appears so necessary to the other, that it seems hardly to be
doubted that this was the cause, or that the effect must have been most
surpassingly beautiful.MODE OF LIGHTING TEMPLES.The arrangement of the interior of Grecian temples necessarily depended
on the mode in which they were lighted.No one will, I believe, now
contend, as was once done, that it was by lamplight alone that the
beauty of their interiors could be seen; and as light certainly was not
introduced through the side walls, nor could be in sufficient quantities
through the doorways, it is only from the roof that it could be
admitted.At the same time it could not have been by a large horizontal
opening in the roof, as has been supposed, as that would have admitted
the rain and snow as well as the light; and the only alternative seems
to be one I suggested some years ago—of a clerestory,[142] similar
internally to that found in all the great Egyptian temples,[143] but
externally requiring such a change of arrangement as was necessary to
adapt it to a sloping instead of a flat roof.This could have been
effected by countersinking it into the roof, so as to make it in fact 3
ridges in those parts where the light was admitted, though the regular
<DW72> of the roof was retained between these openings, so that neither
the ridge nor the continuity of the lines of the roof was interfered
with.This would effect all that was required, and in the most beautiful
manner; it moreover agrees with all the remains of Greek temples that
now exist, as well as with all the descriptions that have been handed
down to us from antiquity.to 1 in]

[Illustration: 154.Part Section, part Elevation, of Great Temple at
Agrigentum.This arrangement will be understood from the section of the Parthenon
(Woodcut No.153), restored in accordance with the above explanation,
which agrees perfectly with all that remains on the spot, as well as
with all the accounts we have of that celebrated temple.The same system
applies even more easily to the great hexastyle at Pæstum and to the
beautiful little Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, in Phigaleia (Woodcut No.149), and in fact to all regular Greek temples.Indeed, it seems
impossible to account for the peculiarities of that temple except on
some such theory as this.Any one who studies the plan (Woodcut No.149)
will see at once what pains were taken to bring the internal columns
exactly into the spaces between those of the external peristyle.The
effect inside is clumsy, and never would have been attempted were it not
that practically their position was seen from the outside, and this
could hardly have been so on any other hypothesis than that now
proposed.An equally important point in the examination of this theory
is that it applies equally to the exceptional ones.The side aisles, for
instance, of the great temple at Agrigentum were, as before mentioned,
lighted by side windows; the central one could only be lighted from the
roof, and it is easy to see how this could be effected by introducing
openings between the telamones, as shown in Woodcut No.In the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius (Woodcut No.196), as described
by Vitruvius,[144] the nave had two storeys of columns all round, and
the middle was open to the sky.Dorpfield that the temple in Vitruvius’s time was incomplete, and that
subsequently when Hadrian erected the great chryselephantine statue in
it the nave may have lost its hypæthral source of light.(In that case
its light may have been introduced through the court or hypæthron in
front of the cell, such as is shown on the plan in Woodcut No.The Ionic temples of Asia are all too much ruined to enable us to say
exactly in what manner, and to what extent, this mode of lighting was
applied to them, though there seems no doubt that the method there
adopted was very similar in all its main features.Elevation of West End of Erechtheium.The little Temple of Nikè Apteros and the temple on the Ilissus, were
both too small to require any complicated arrangement of the sort, but
the Ionic temple of Pandrosus was lighted by windows which still remain
at the west end, so that it is possible the same expedient may have been
adopted to at least some extent in the Asiatic examples.The latter,
however, is, with one exception, the sole instance of windows in any
European-Greek temple, the only other example being in the very
exceptional temple at Agrigentum.It is valuable, besides, as showing
how little the Greeks were bound by rules or by any fancied laws of
symmetry.As is shown in the plan, elevation, and view (Woodcuts Nos.155, 156,
157), the Erechtheium consisted, properly speaking, of 3 temples grouped
together; and it is astonishing what pains the architect took to prevent
their being mistaken for one.The porticoes of two of them are on
different levels, and the third or caryatide porch is of a different
height and different style.Every one of these features is perfectly
symmetrical in itself, and the group is beautifully balanced and
arranged; and yet no Gothic architect in his wildest moments could have
conceived anything more picturesquely irregular than the whole becomes.Indeed, there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that Greek
architecture was fettered by any fixed laws of formal symmetry: each
detail, every feature, every object, such as a hall or temple, which
could be considered as one complete and separate whole, was perfectly
symmetrical and regular; but no two buildings—no two apartments—if for
different purposes, were made to look like one.On the contrary, it is
quite curious to observe what pains they took to arrange their buildings
so as to produce variety and contrast, instead of formality or
singleness of effect.Temples, when near one another, were never placed
parallel, nor were even their propylæa and adjuncts ever so arranged as
to be seen together or in one line.The Egyptians, as before remarked,
had the same feeling, but carried it into even the details of the same
building, which the Greeks did not.In this, indeed, as in almost every
other artistic mode of expression, they seem to have hit exactly the
happy medium, so as to produce the greatest harmony with the greatest
variety, and to satisfy the minutest scrutiny and the most refined
taste, while their buildings produced an immediate and striking effect
on even the most careless and casual beholders.Owing to the Erechtheium having been converted into a Byzantine church
during the Middle Ages, almost all traces of its original internal
arrangements have been obliterated, and this, with the peculiar
combination of three temples in one, makes it more than usually
difficult to restore.The annexed plan, however, meets all the
requirements of the case in so far as they are known.To the east was a
portico of 6 columns, between two of which stood an altar to Dione,
mentioned in the inscription enumerating the repairs in 409 B.C.;[145]
inside, according to Pausanias,[146] were three altars, the principal
dedicated to Poseidon, the others to Butes and Hephaistos.From its
form, it is evident the roof must have been supported by pillars, and
they probably also bore a clerestory, by which, I believe, with rare
exceptions, all Greek temples were lighted.Restored Plan of Erechtheium.The dark parts remain; the shaded are restorations.
]The Temple of Pandrosus was on a lower level, and was approached by a
flight of steps, corresponding with which was a chamber, containing the
well of salt water, and which apparently was the abode of the
serpent-god Erechthonios, mentioned by Herodotus.[147] The central cell
was lighted by the very exceptional expedient of 3 windows in the
western wall, which looked directly into it.Beyond this, on the south,
was the beautiful caryatide porch, where, if anywhere within the temple,
grew the olive sacred to Minerva.Unfortunately, our principal guide,
Pausanias, does not give us a hint where the olive-tree grew, and on the
whole I am inclined to believe it was in the enclosure outside the
western wall of the temple,[148] and to which a doorway leads directly
from the Temple of Pandrosus, as well as one under the north portico,
the use of which it is impossible to explain unless we assume that this
enclosure was really of exceptional importance.TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.A history of Grecian architecture can hardly be considered as complete
without some mention of the great Ephesian temple, which was one of the
largest and most gorgeous of all those erected by the Greeks, and
considered by them as one of the seven wonders of the world.Strange to
say, till very recently even its situation was utterly unknown; and even
now that it has been revealed to us by the energy and intelligence of
Mr.Wood, scarcely enough remains to enable him to restore the plan with
anything like certainty.This is the more remarkable, as it was found
buried under 17 to 20 feet of mud, which must have been the accumulation
of centuries, and might, one would have thought, have preserved
considerable portions of it from the hand of the spoiler.Plan of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, embodying
Mr.Wood’s researches embodies all the
information he has been able to obtain.The dimensions of the double
peristyle, and the number and position of its 96 columns, are quite
certain.So are the positions of the north, south, and west walls of the
cella; so that the only points of uncertainty are the positions of the
four columns necessary to make up the 100 mentioned by Pliny,[149] and
the internal arrangement of the cella itself and of the opisthodomus.With regard to the first there seems very little latitude for choice.The position of the other two must
be determined either by bringing forward the wall enclosing the stairs,
so as to admit of the intercolumniation east and west being the same as
that of the other columns, or of spacing them so as to divide the inner
roof of the pronaos into equal squares.I have preferred the latter as
that which appears to me the most probable.[150]

The west wall of the cella and the position of the statue having been
found, the arrangement of the pillars surrounding this apartment does
not admit of much latitude.Fragments of these pillars were found, but
not _in situ_, showing that they were in two heights and supported a
gallery.I have spaced them intermediately between the external pillars,
as in the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ (Woodcut No.149), because I do not
know of any other mode by which this temple could be lighted, except by
an opaion, as suggested for that temple; and if this is so they must
have been so spaced.Carrying out this system it leaves an opisthodomus
which is an exact square, which is so likely a form for that apartment
that it affords considerable confirmation to the correctness of this
restoration that it should be so.The four pillars it probably contained
are so spaced as to divide it into nine equal squares.Restored in this manner the temple appears considerably less in
dimensions than might have been supposed from Pliny’s text.His
measurements apply only to the lower step of the platform, which is
found to be 421 ft.But the temple itself, from angle to angle
of the peristyles, is only 342 ft.Assuming this restoration to be correct there can be very little doubt
as to the position of the thirty-six columnæ cælatæ, of which several
specimens have been recovered by Mr.Wood, and are now in the British
Museum.They must have been the sixteen at either end and the four in
the pronaos, shown darker in the woodcut.From the temple standing on a platform so much larger than appears
necessary, it is probable that pedestals with statues stood in front of
each column, and if this were so, the sculptures, with the columnæ
cælatæ and the noble architecture of the temple itself, must have made
up a combination of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic art such as hardly
existed anywhere else, and which consequently the ancients were quite
justified in considering as one of the wonders of the world.MUNICIPAL ARCHITECTURE.Very little now remains of all the various classes of municipal and
domestic buildings which must once have covered the land of Greece, and
from what we know of the exquisite feelings for art that pervaded that
people, they were certainly not less beautiful, though more ephemeral,
than the sacred buildings whose ruins still remain to us.There are, however, two buildings in Athens which, though small, give us
most exalted ideas of their taste in such matters.The first, already
alluded to, usually known as the Tower of the Winds, is a plain
octagonal building about 45 ft.in height by 24 in width, ornamented by
2 small porches of 2 pillars each, of the Corinthian order, the capitals
of which are represented in Woodcut No.Its roof, like the rest of
the building, is of white marble, and of simple but very elegant design,
and below this is a frieze of 8 large figures, symbolical of the 8
winds, from which the tower takes its name, they in fact being the
principal objects and ornaments of the building, the most important use
of which appears to have been to contain a clepsydra or water-clock.The other building, though smaller, is still more beautiful.It is known
as the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, and consists of a square base 12
ft.wide, on which stands a circular temple adorned by 6
Corinthian columns, which, with their entablature and the roof and
pedestal they support, make up 22 ft.more, so that the whole height of
the monument is only 34 ft.Notwithstanding these insignificant
dimensions, the beauty of its columns (Woodcut No.143) and of their
entablature—above all, the beauty of the roof and of the finial
ornament, which crowns the whole and is unrivalled for elegance even in
Greek art—make up a composition so perfect that nothing in any other
style or age can be said to surpass it.[151] If this is a fair index of
the art that was lavished on the smaller objects, the temples hardly
give a just idea of all that have perished.In extreme contrast with the buildings last described, which were among
the smallest, came the theatres, which were the largest, of the
monuments the Greeks seem ever to have attempted.The annexed plan of one at Dramyssus, the ancient Dodona, will give an
idea of their forms and arrangements.Its dimensions may be said to be
gigantic, being 443 ft.across; but even this, though perhaps the
largest in Greece, is far surpassed by many in Asia Minor.What remains
of it, however, is merely the auditorium, and consists only of ranges of
seats arranged in a semicircle, but without architectural ornament.In
all the examples in Europe, the proscenium,[152] which was the only part
architecturally ornamented, has perished, so that, till we can restore
this with something like certainty, the theatres hardly come within the
class of Architecture as a fine art.The theatre of Dionysus at Athens, which was excavated and laid bare in
1862-63, measures only 165 ft.Built on the south
side of the Acropolis, the natural <DW72> forming the rising ground was
utilised for the foundations of the tiers of seats which, in some cases,
and particularly at the back, were hewn in the rock; so that they were
carried back 294 ft.In the theatre of
Epidaurus, which, according to Pausanias, was the most beautiful theatre
in the world, the lines of the seats are continued on each side of the
orchestra so as to form a horse-shoe on plan; the foundations of the
stage, the projecting side wings with staircases on each side, and other
buildings belonging to the stage are still preserved.In Asia Minor some of the theatres have their proscenia adorned with
niches and columns, and friezes of great richness; but all these belong
to the Roman period, and, though probably copies of the mode in which
the Greeks ornamented theirs, are so corrupt in style as to prevent
their being used with safety in attempting to restore the earlier
examples.Many circumstances would indeed induce us to believe that the proscenia
of the earlier theatres may have been of wood or bronze, or both
combined, and heightened by painting and carving to a great degree of
richness.This, though appropriate and consonant with the origin and
history of the drama, would be fatal to the expectation of anything
being found to illustrate its earliest forms.Like the other Aryan races, the Greeks never were tomb-builders, and
nothing of any importance of this class is found in Greece, except the
tombs of the early Pelasgic races, which were either tumuli, or
treasuries, as they are popularly called.There are, it is true, some
headstones and small pillars of great beauty, but they are monolithic,
and belong rather to the department of Sculpture than of Architecture.In Asia Minor there are some important tombs, some built and others cut
in the rock.Some of the latter have been described before in speaking
of the tombs of the Lycians.The built examples which remain almost all
belong to the Roman period, though the typical and by far the most
splendid example of Greek tombs was that erected by Artemisia to the
memory of her husband Mausolus at Halicarnassus.We scarcely know enough
of the ethnic relations of the Carians to be able to understand what
induced them to adopt so exceptional a mode of doing honour to their
dead.With pure Greeks it must have been impossible, but the inhabitants
of these coasts were of a different race, and had a different mode of
expressing their feelings.View of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, as restored
by the Author.]Till Sir Charles Newton’s visit to Halicarnassus in 1856 the very site
of this seventh wonder of the world was a matter of dispute.We now know
enough to be able to restore the principal parts with absolute
certainty, and to ascertain its dimensions and general appearance within
very insignificant limits of error.[153]

The dimensions quoted by Pliny[154] are evidently extracted from a
larger work, said to have been written by the architect who erected it,
and which existed at his time.Every one of them has been confirmed in
the most satisfactory manner by recent discoveries, and enable us to put
the whole together without much hesitation.Plan of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, from a
Drawing by the Author.Sufficient remains of the quadriga, which crowned the monument, have
been brought home to give its dimensions absolutely.All the parts of
the Ionic order are complete.The steps of the pyramid have been found
and portions of the three friezes, and these, with Pliny’s dimensions
and description, are all that are required to assure us that its aspect
must have been very similar to the form represented in Woodcut No.There can be little doubt with regard to the upper storey, but in order
to work out to the dimensions given by Pliny (411 ft.in circumference)
and those found cut out in the rock (462 ft.), the lower storey must be
spread out beyond the upper to that extent, and most probably something
after the manner shown in the woodcut.The building consisted internally of two chambers superimposed the one
on the other, each 52 ft.by 42 ft.—the lower one being the
vestibule to the tomb beyond—the upper was surrounded by a peristyle of
36 columns.Externally the height was divided into three equal portions
of 37 ft.each (25 cubits), one of which was allotted to the
base—one to the pyramid with its meta—and one to the order between them.These with 14 ft., the height of the quadriga, and the same dimension
belonging to the lower entablature, made up the height of 140 Greek
feet[155] given it by Pliny.Though its height was unusually great for a Greek building, its other
dimensions were small.The admiration
therefore which the Greeks expressed regarding it must have arisen,
first, from the unusual nature of its design and of the purpose to which
it was applied, or perhaps more still from the extent and richness of
its sculptured decorations, of the beauty of which we are now enabled to
judge, and can fully share with them in admiring.Another, but very much smaller, tomb of about the same age was found by
Mr.Newton at Cnidus, and known as the Lion Tomb, from the figure of
that animal, now in the British Museum, which crowned its summit.Like
many other tombs found in Asia and in Africa, it follows the type of the
Mausoleum in its more important features.It possesses a base—a
peristyle—a pyramid of steps—and, lastly, an acroterion or pedestal
meant to support a quadriga or statue, or some other crowning object,
which appropriately terminated the design upwards.Several examples erected during the Roman period will be illustrated
when speaking of the architecture of that people, all bearing the
impress of the influence the Mausoleum had on the tomb architecture of
that age; but unfortunately we cannot yet go backwards and point out the
type from which the design of the Mausoleum itself was elaborated.The
tombs of Babylon and Passargadæ are remote both geographically and
artistically, though not without certain essential resemblances.Perhaps
the missing links may some day reward the industry of some scientific
explorer.At Cyrene there is a large group of tombs of Grecian date and with
Grecian details, but all cut in the rock, and consequently differing
widely in their form from those just described.It is not clear whether
the circumstance of this city possessing such a necropolis arose from
its proximity to Egypt, and consequently from a mere desire to imitate
that people, or from some ethnic peculiarity.Most probably the latter,
though we know so little about them that it is difficult to speak with
precision on such a subject.[156]

These tombs are chiefly interesting from many of the details of the
architecture still retaining the colour with which they were originally
adorned.The triglyphs of the Doric order are still painted blue,[157]
as appears to have been the universal practice, and the pillars are
outlined by red lines.The metopes are darker, and are adorned with
painted groups of figures, the whole making up one of the most perfect
examples of Grecian  decoration which still remain.Rock-cut and structural Tombs at Cyrene.(From
Hamilton’s ‘Wanderings in North Africa.’)]

There is another tomb at the same place—this time structural—which is
interesting not so much for any architectural beauty it possesses as
from its belonging to an exceptional type.It consists now only of a
circular basement—the upper part is gone—and is erected over an
excavated rock-cut tomb.There seem to be several others of the same
class in the necropolis, and they are the only examples known except
those at Marathos, one of which is illustrated above (Woodcut No.As before hinted, the Syrian example does not appear to be very ancient,
but we want further information before speaking positively on this
subject.No one on the spot has attempted to fix with precision the age
of the Cyrenean examples; nor have they been drawn in such detail as is
requisite for others to ascertain the fact.They may be as late as the
time of the Romans, but can hardly be dated as prior to the age of
Alexander the Great.(From Hamilton’s ‘North Africa.’)]


                         DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.We have nothing left but imperfect verbal descriptions of the domestic,
and even of the palatial architecture of Greece, and, consequently, can
only judge imperfectly of its forms.Unfortunately, too, Pompeii, though
but half a Greek city, belongs to too late and too corrupt an age to
enable us to use it even as an illustration; but we may rest assured
that in this, as in everything else, the Greeks displayed the same
exquisite taste which pervades not only their monumental architecture,
but all their works in metal or clay, down to the meanest object, which
have been preserved to our times.It is probable that the forms of their houses were much more irregular
and picturesque than we are in the habit of supposing them to have been.They seem to have taken such pains in their temples—in the Erechtheium,
for instance, and at Eleusis—to make every part tell its own tale, that
anything like forced regularity must have been offensive to them, and
they would probably make every apartment exactly of the dimensions
required, and group them so that no one should under any circumstances
be confounded with another.This, however, with all the details of their domestic arts, must now
remain to us as mere speculation, and the architectural history of
Greece must be confined to her temples and monumental erections.These
suffice to explain the nature and forms of the art, and to assign to it
the rank of the purest and most intellectual of all the styles which
have yet been invented or practised in any part of the world.ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

The ethnographical history of art in Italy is in all its essential
features similar to that of Greece, though arriving at widely different
results from causes the influence of which it is easy to trace.Both are
examples of an Aryan development based on a Turanian civilisation which
it has superseded.In Greece—as already remarked—the traces of the
earlier people are indistinct and difficult to seize.In Italy their
features are drawn with a coarser hand, and extend down into a more
essentially historic age.It thus happens that we have no doubt as to
the existence of the Etruscan people—we know very nearly who they were,
and cannot be mistaken as to the amount and kind of influence they
exercised on the institutions and arts of the Romans.The more striking differences appear to have arisen from the fact, that
Greece had some four or five centuries of comparative repose during
which to form herself and her institutions after the Pelasgic
civilisation was struck down at the time of the Dorian occupation of the
Peloponnesus.During that period she was undisturbed by foreign
invasion, and was not tempted by successful conquests to forsake the
gentler social arts for the more vulgar objects of national ambition.Rome’s history, on the other hand, from the earliest aggregation of a
robber horde on the banks of the Tiber till she became the arbiter of
the destinies of the ancient world, is little beyond the record of
continuous wars.From the possession of the seven hills, Rome gradually
carried her sway at the edge of the sword to the dominion of the whole
of Italy and of all the then known world, destroying everything that
stood in the way of her ambition, and seeking only the acquisition of
wealth and power.Greece, in the midst of her successful cultivation of the arts of
commerce and of peace, stimulated by the wholesome rivalry of the
different States of which she was composed, was awakened by the Persian
invasion to a struggle for existence.The result was one of the most
brilliant passages in the world’s history, and no nation was ever more
justified in the jubilant outburst of enthusiastic patriotism that
followed the repulse of the invader, than was Greece in that with which
she commenced her short but brilliant career.A triumph so gained by a
people so constituted led to results at which we still wonder, though
they cause us no surprise.If Greece attained her manhood on the
battle-fields of Marathon and Salamis, Rome equally reached the maturity
of her career when she cruelly and criminally destroyed Corinth and
Carthage, and the sequel was such as might be expected from such a
difference of education.Rome had no time for the cultivation of the
arts of peace, and as little sympathy for their gentler influences.Conquest, wealth, and consequent power, were the objects of her
ambition—for these she sacrificed everything, and by their means she
attained a pinnacle of greatness that no nation had reached before or
has since.Her arts have all the impress of this greatness, and are
characterised by the same vulgar grandeur which marks everything she
did.Very different they are from the intellectual beauty found in the
works of the Greeks, but in some respects they are as interesting to
those who can read the character of nations in their artistic
productions.In the earlier part of her career Rome was an Etruscan city under
Etruscan kings and institutions.After she had emancipated herself from
their yoke, Etruria long remained her equal and her rival in political
power, and her instructress in religion and the arts of peace.This
continued so long, and the architectural remains of that people are so
numerous, and have been so thoroughly investigated, that we have no
difficulty in ascertaining the extent of influence the older nation had
on the nascent empire.It is more difficult to ascertain exactly who the
Etruscans themselves were, or whence they came.But on the whole there
seems every reason to believe they migrated from Asia Minor some twelve
or thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and fixed themselves in
Italy, most probably among the Umbrians, or some people of cognate race,
who had settled there before—so long before, perhaps, as to entitle them
to be considered among the aboriginal inhabitants.It would have been only natural that the expatriated Trojans should have
sought refuge among such a kindred people, though we have nothing but
the vaguest tradition to warrant a belief that this was the case.They
may too from time to time have received other accessions to their
strength; but they were a foreign people in a strange land, and scarcely
seem ever to have become naturalised in the country of their adoption.But what stood still more in their way was the fact that they were an
old Turanian people in presence of a young and ambitious community of
Aryan origin, and, as has always been the case when this has happened,
they were destined to disappear.Before doing so, however, they left
their impress on the institutions and the arts of their conquerors to
such an extent as to be still traceable in every form.It may have been
that there was as much Pelasgic blood in the veins of the Greeks as
there was Etruscan in those of the Romans; but the civilisation of the
former had passed away before Greece had developed herself.Etruria, on
the other hand, was long contemporary with Rome: in early times her
equal, and sometimes her mistress, and consequently in a position to
force her arts upon her to an extent that was never effected on the
opposite shore of the Adriatic.Nothing can prove more clearly the Turanian origin of the Etruscans than
the fact that all we know of them is derived from their tombs.These
exist in hundreds—it may almost be said in thousands—at the gates of
every city; but no vestige of a temple has come down to our days.Had
any Semitic blood flowed in their veins, as has been sometimes
suspected, they could not have been so essentially sepulchral as they
were, or so fond of contemplating death, as is proved by the fact that a
purely Semitic tomb is still a desideratum among antiquaries, not one
having as yet been discovered.What we should like to find in Etruria
would be a square pyramidal mound with external steps leading to a cella
on its summit; but no trace of any such has yet been detected.Their
other temples—using the word in the sense in which we usually understand
it—were, as might be expected, insignificant and ephemeral.So much so,
indeed, that except from one passage in Vitruvius,[158] and our being
able to detect the influence of the Etruscan style in the buildings of
Imperial Rome, we should hardly be aware of their existence.The truth
seems to be that the religion of the Etruscans, like that of most of
their congeners, was essentially ancestral, and their worship took the
form of respect for the remains of the dead and reverence for their
memory.Tombs consequently, and not temples, were the objects on which
they lavished their architectural resources.They certainly were not
idolaters, in the sense in which we usually understand the term.They
had no distinct or privileged priesthood, and consequently had no motive
for erecting temples which by their magnificence should be pleasing to
their gods or tend to the glorification of their kings or priests.Still
less were they required for congregational purposes by the people at
large.The only individual temple of Etruscan origin of which we have any
knowledge, is that of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome.[159] Originally small,
it was repaired and rebuilt till it became under the Empire a splendid
fane.But not one vestige of it now remains, nor any description from
which we could restore its appearance with anything like certainty.From the chapter of the work of Vitruvius just alluded to, we learn that
the Etruscans had two classes of temples: one circular, like their
structural tombs, and dedicated to one deity; the other class
rectangular, but these, always possessing three cells, were devoted to
the worship of three gods.Plan and Elevation of an Etruscan Temple.]The general arrangement of the plan, as described by Vitruvius, was that
shown on the plan above (Fig.1), and is generally assented to by all
those who have attempted the restoration.In larger temples in Roman
times the number of pillars in front may have been doubled, and they
would thus be arranged like those of the portico of the Pantheon, which
is essentially an Etruscan arrangement.The restoration of the elevation
is more difficult, and the argument too long to be entered upon
here;[160] but its construction and proportions seem to have been very
much like those drawn in the above diagram (Fig.Of course, as
wooden structures, they were richly and elaborately carved, and the
effect heightened by colours, but it is in vain to attempt to restore
them.Without a single example to guide us, and with very little
collateral evidence which can at all be depended upon, it is hardly
possible that any satisfactory restoration could now be made.Moreover,
their importance in the history of art is so insignificant, that the
labour such an attempt must involve would hardly be repaid by the
result.The original Etruscan circular temple seems to have been a mere circular
cell with a porch.The Romans surrounded it with a peristyle, which
probably did not exist in the original style.They magnified it
afterwards into the most characteristic and splendid of all their
temples, the Pantheon, whose portico is Etruscan in arrangement and
design, and whose cell still more distinctly belongs to that order; nor
can there be any doubt that the simpler Roman temples of circular form
are derived from Etruscan originals.[161] It would therefore be of great
importance if we could illustrate the later buildings from existing
remains of the older: but the fact is that such deductions as we may
draw from the copies are our only source of information respecting the
originals.We know little of any of the civil buildings with which the cities of
Etruria were adorned, beyond the knowledge obtained from the remains of
their theatres and amphitheatres.The form of the latter was essentially
Etruscan, and was adopted by the Romans, with whom it became their most
characteristic and grandest architectural object.Of the amphitheatres
of ancient Etruria only one now remains in so perfect a state as to
enable us to judge of their forms.It is that at Sutrium, which,
however, being entirely cut in the rock, neither affords information as
to the mode of construction nor enables us to determine its age.in its greatest length by 265 in breadth,
and it is consequently much nearer a circular form than the Romans
generally adopted: but in other respects the arrangements are such as
appear to have usually prevailed in after times.Besides these, we have numerous works of utility, but these belong more
strictly to engineering than to architectural science.The city walls of
the Etruscans surpass those of any other ancient nation in extent and
beauty of workmanship.Their drainage works and their bridges, as well
as those of the kindred Pelasgians in Greece, still remain monuments of
their industrial science and skill, which their successors never
surpassed.On the whole, perhaps we are justified in asserting that the Etruscans
were not an architectural people, and had no temples or palaces worthy
of attention.It at least seems certain that nothing of the sort is now
to be found, even in ruins, and were it not that the study of Etruscan
art is a necessary introduction to that of Roman, it would hardly be
worth while trying to gather together and illustrate the few fragments
and notices of it that remain.The tombs of the Etruscans now found may be divided into two
classes—first, those cut in the rock, and resembling dwelling-houses;
secondly, the circular tumuli, which latter are by far the most numerous
and important class.Each of these may be again subdivided into two kinds.The rock-cut tombs
include, firstly, those with only a façade on the face of the rock and a
sepulchral chamber within; secondly, those cut quite out of the rock and
standing free all round.To this class probably once belonged an immense
number of tombs built in the ordinary way; but all these have totally
disappeared, and consequently the class, as now under consideration,
consists entirely of excavated examples.The second class may be divided into those tumuli erected over chambers
cut in the tufaceous rock which is found all over Etruria, and those
which have chambers built above-ground.In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say which of
these classes is the older.We know that the Egyptians buried in caves
long before the Etruscans landed in Italy, and at the same time raised
pyramids over rock-cut and built chambers.We know too that Abraham was
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Syria.On the other hand, the tombs
at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113), the treasuries of Mycenæ (Woodcut No.124),
the sepulchre of Alyattes (Woodcut No.115), and many others, are proofs
of the antiquity of the tumuli, which are found all over Europe and
Asia, and appear to have existed from the earliest ages.The comparative antiquity of the different kinds of tombs being thus
doubtful, it will be sufficient for the purposes of the present work to
classify them architecturally.It may probably be assumed, with safety,
that all the modes which have been enumerated were practised by the
Etruscans at a period very slightly subsequent to their migration into
Italy.Of the first class of the rock-cut tombs—those with merely a façade
externally—the most remarkable group is that at Castel d’Asso.At this
place there is a perpendicular cliff with hundreds of these tombs ranged
along its face, like houses in a street.A similar arrangement is found
in Egypt at Benihasan, at Petra, and Cyrene, and around all the more
ancient cities of Asia Minor.In Etruria they generally consist of one chamber lighted by the doorway
only.Their internal arrangement appears to be an imitation of a
dwelling chamber, with furniture, like the apartment itself, cut out of
the rock.Externally they have little or no pretension to architectural
decoration.It is true that some tombs are found adorned with
frontispieces of a debased Doric or Ionic order; but these were executed
at a much later period and under Roman domination, and cannot therefore
be taken as specimens of Etruscan art, but rather of that corruption of
style sure to arise from a conquered people trying to imitate the arts
of their rulers.Tombs at Castel d’Asso.(From the ‘Annale del
Instituto.’)]

The general appearance of the second class of rock-cut tombs will be
understood from the woodcut (No.168), representing two monuments at
Castel d’Asso.Unfortunately neither is complete, nor is there any
complete example known to exist of this class.Perhaps the apex was
added structurally and that these, like all such things in Etruria, have
perished.Possibly, if cut in the rock, the terminals were slender
carved ornaments, and therefore liable to injury.They are usually
restored by antiquaries in the shape of rectilinear pyramids, but so far
as I know, there is no authority for this.On the contrary, it is more
in accordance with what we know of the style and its affinities to
suppose that the termination of these monuments, even if added in
masonry, was curvilinear.Mouldings from Tombs at Castel d’Asso.]One remarkable thing about the rock-cut tombs is the form of their
mouldings, which differ from any found elsewhere in Europe.Two of these
are shown in the annexed woodcut (No.They are very numerous and
in great variety, but do not in any instance show the slightest trace of
a cornice, nor of any tendency towards one.On the contrary, in place of
this, we find nothing but a reverse moulding.It is probable that
similar forms may be found in Asia Minor, while something resembling
them actually occurs at Persepolis and elsewhere.It is remarkable that
this feature did not penetrate to Rome, and that no trace of its
influence is found there, as might have been expected.[162]


                                TUMULI.The simplest, and therefore perhaps the earliest, monument which can be
erected over the graves of the dead, by a people who reverence their
departed relatives, is a mound of earth or a cairn of stones, and such
seems to have been the form adopted by the Turanian or Tartar races of
mankind from the earliest days to the present hour.It is scarcely
necessary to remark how universal such monuments were among the ruder
tribes of Northern Europe.The Etruscans improved upon this by
surrounding the base with a _podium_, or supporting wall of masonry.This not only defined its limits and gave it dignity, but enabled
entrances to be made in it, and otherwise converted it from a mere
hillock into a monumental structure.It is usually supposed that this
basement was an invariable part of all Etruscan tumuli, and when it is
not found, it is assumed that it has been removed, or that it is buried
in the rubbish of the mound.No doubt such a stone basement may easily
have been removed by the peasantry, or buried, but it is by no means
clear that this was invariably the case.It seems that the enclosure was
frequently a circle of stones or monumental steles, in the centre of
which the tumulus stood.The monuments have hitherto been so carelessly
examined and restored, that it is difficult to arrive at anything like
certainty with regard to the details of their structure.Nor can we draw
any certain conclusion from a comparison with other tumuli of cognate
races.The description by Herodotus of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis
(Woodcut No.115), those described by Pausanias as existing in the
Peloponnesus, and the appearances of those at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
might be interpreted either way; but those at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113),
and a great number at least of those in Etruria, have a structural
circle of stone as a supporting base to the mound.Plan of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.These tumuli are found existing in immense numbers in every necropolis
of the Etruscans.A large space was generally set apart for the purpose
outside the walls of all their great cities.In these cemeteries the
tumuli are arranged in rows, like houses in streets.Even now we can
count them by hundreds, and in the neighbourhood of the largest
cities—at Vulci, for instance—almost by thousands.Most of them are now worn down by the effect of time to nearly the level
of the ground, though some of the larger ones still retain an imposing
appearance.Nearly all have been rifled at some early period, though the
treasures still discovered almost daily in some places show how vast
their extent was, and how much even now remains to be done before this
vast mine of antiquity can be said to be exhausted.One of the most remarkable among those that have been opened in modern
times is at Cervetri, the ancient Cære, known as the Regulini Galeassi
tomb, from the names of its discoverers.Sections of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.(From
Canina’s ‘Etruria Antica.’) Scale for large section, 50 ft.Like a Nubian pyramid or Buddhist tope, it consists of an inner and
older tumulus, around and over which another has been added.In the
outer mound are five tombs either of dependent or inferior personages.These were rifled long ago; but the outer pyramid having effectually
concealed the entrance to the principal tomb, it remained untouched till
very lately, when it yielded to its discoverers a richer collection of
ornaments and utensils in gold and bronze than has ever been found in
one place before.The dimensions and arrangements of this tumulus will be understood from
Woodcuts Nos.170, 171, and from the two sections of the principal tomb
which are annexed to them.These last display an irregularity of
construction very unusual in such cases, for which no cause can be
assigned.The usual section is perfectly regular, as in the annexed
woodcut (No.172), taken from another tomb at the same place.These chambers, like all those of the early Etruscans, are vaulted on
the horizontal principle, like the tombs at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
though none are found in Italy at all equal to those of Greece in
dimensions or beauty of construction.173 is a perspective view of the principal chamber in the
Regulini Galeassi tomb, showing the position of the furniture found in
it when first opened, consisting of biers or bedsteads, shields, arrows,
and vessels of various sorts.A number of vases are hung in a curious
recess in the roof, the form of which would be inexplicable but for the
utensils found in it.With this clue to its meaning we can scarcely
doubt that it represents a place for hanging such vessels in the houses
of the living.All the treasures found in this tomb are in the oldest style of Etruscan
art, and are so similar to the bronzes and ornaments brought by Layard
from Assyria as to lead to the belief that they had a common origin.The
tomb, with its contents, probably dates from the 9th or 10th century
before the Christian era.The largest tomb hitherto discovered in Etruria is now known as the
Cocumella, in the necropolis at Vulci.in

Tomb.]Near its centre are the remains of two solid towers, one circular, the
other square, neither of them actually central, nor are they placed in
such a way that we can understand how they can have formed a part of any
symmetrical design.A plan and a view of the present appearance of this
monument are given in Woodcuts 174 and 175.This tumulus, with its principal remaining features thus standing on one
side of the centre, may possibly assist us to understand the curious
description found in Pliny[163] of the tomb of Porsenna.This
description is quoted from Varro, being evidently regarded by Pliny
himself as not a little apocryphal.According to this account it
consisted of a square basement 300 ft.each way, from which arose five
pyramids, united at the summit by a bronze circle or cupola.This was
again surmounted by four other pyramids, the summits of which were again
united at a height of 300 ft.From this point rose
still five more pyramids, whose height Varro (from modesty, as Pliny
surmises) omits to state, but which was estimated in Etruscan traditions
at the same height as the rest of the monument.This last statement,
which does not rest on any real authority, may well be regarded as
exaggerated; but if we take the total height as about 400 ft., it is
easy to understand that in the age of Pliny, when all the buildings were
low, such a structure, as high as the steeple at Salisbury, would appear
fabulous; but the vast piles that have been erected by tomb-building
races in other parts of the earth render it by no means improbable that
Varro was justified in what he asserted.[164]

Near the gate of Albano is found a small tomb of five pyramidal pillars
rising from a square base, exactly corresponding with Varro’s
description of the lower part of the tomb of Porsenna.It is called by
tradition the tomb of Aruns, the son of Porsenna, though the character
of the mouldings with which it is adorned would lead us to assign to it
a more modern date.It consists of a lofty podium, on which are placed
five pyramids, a large one in the centre and four smaller ones at the
angles.Its present appearance is shown in the annexed woodcut (No.There are not in Etruria any features sufficiently marked to
characterise a style of architecture, nor any pillars with their
accessories which can be considered to constitute an order.It is true
that in some of the rock-cut tombs square piers support the roof; and in
one or two instances rounded pillars are found, but these are either
without mouldings or ornamented only with Roman details, betraying the
lateness of their execution.The absence of built examples of the class
of tombs found in the rock prevents us from recognising any of those
peculiarities of construction which sometimes are as characteristic of
the style and as worthy of attention as the more purely ornamental
parts.From their city gates, their aqueducts and bridges, we know that the
Etruscans used the radiating arch at an early age, with deep voussoirs
and elegant mouldings, giving it that character of strength which the
Romans afterwards imparted to their works of the same class.The Cloaca
Maxima of Rome (Woodcut No.104) must be considered as a work executed
under Etruscan superintendence, and a very perfect specimen of the
class.At the same time the Etruscans used the pointed arch, constructed
horizontally, and seem to have had the same predilection for it which
characterised the cognate Pelasgian race in Greece.A gateway at Arpino
(Woodcut No.177) is almost identical with that at Thoricus (Woodcut No.126), but larger and more elegant; and there are many specimens of the
same class found in Italy.The portion of an aqueduct at Tusculum, shown
in Woodcut No.178, is a curious transition specimen, where the two
stones meeting at the apex (usually called the Egyptian form, being the
first step towards the true arch) are combined with a substructure of
horizontal converging masonry.In either of these instances the horizontal arch is a legitimate mode of
construction, and may have been used long after the principle of the
radiating arch was known.The great convenience of the latter, as
enabling large spaces to be spanned even with brick or the smallest
stones, and thus dispensing with the necessity for stones of very large
dimensions, led ultimately to its universal adoption.Subsequently, when
the pointed form of the radiating arch was introduced, no motive
remained for the retention of the horizontal method, and it was entirely
abandoned.We now approach the last revolution that completed and closed the great
cycle of the arts and civilisation of the ancient world.We have seen
Art spring Minerva-like, perfect from the head of her great parent, in
Egypt.We have admired it in Assyria, rich, varied, but unstable; aiming
at everything, but never attaining maturity or perfection.We have tried
to trace the threads of early Pelasgic art in Asia, Greece, and Etruria,
spreading their influence over the world, and laying the foundation of
other arts which the Pelasgi were incapable of developing.We have seen
all these elements gathered together in Greece, the essence extracted
from each, and the whole forming the most perfect and beautiful
combinations of intellectual power that the world has yet witnessed.We
have now only to contemplate the last act in the great drama, the
gorgeous but melancholy catastrophe by which all these styles of
architecture were collected in wild confusion in Rome, and there
perished beneath the luxury and crimes of that mighty people, who for a
while made Rome the capital of Europe.View them as we will, the arts of Rome were never an indigenous or
natural production of the soil or people, but an aggregation of foreign
styles in a state of transition from the old and time-honoured forms of
Pagan antiquity to the new development introduced by Christianity.We
cannot of course suppose that the Romans foresaw the result to which
their amalgamation of previous styles was tending; still they advanced
as steadily towards that result as if a prophetic spirit had guided them
to a well-defined conception of what was to be.It was not however
permitted to the Romans to complete this task.Long before the ancient
methods and ideas had been completely moulded into the new, the power of
Rome sank beneath her corruption, and a long pause took place, during
which the Christian arts did not advance in Western Europe beyond the
point they had reached in the age of Constantine.Indeed, in many
respects, they receded from it during the dark ages.When they
reappeared in the 10th and 11th centuries it was in an entirely new garb
and with scarcely a trace of their origin—so distinct indeed that it
appears more like a reinvention than a reproduction of forms long since
familiar to the Roman world.Had Rome retained her power and
pre-eminence a century or two longer, a style might have been elaborated
as distinct from that of the ancient world, and as complete in itself,
as our pointed Gothic, and perhaps more beautiful.Such was not the
destiny of the world; and what we have now to do is to examine this
transition style as we find it in ancient Rome, and familiarise
ourselves with the forms it took during the three centuries of its
existence, as without this knowledge all the arts of the Gothic era
would for ever remain an inexplicable mystery.The chief value of the
Roman style consists in the fact that it contains the germs of all that
is found in the Middle Ages, and affords the key by which its mysteries
may be unlocked, and its treasures rendered available.Had the
transition been carried through in the hands of an art-loving and
artistic people, the architectural beauties of Rome must have surpassed
those of any other city in the world, for its buildings surpass in scale
those of Egypt and in variety those of Greece, while they affect to
combine the beauties of both.In constructive ingenuity they far surpass
anything the world had seen up to that time, but this cannot redeem
offences against good taste, nor enable any Roman productions to command
our admiration as works of art, or entitle them to rank as models to be
followed either literally or in spirit.During the first two centuries and a half of her existence, Rome was
virtually an Etruscan city, wholly under Etruscan influence; and during
that period we read of temples and palaces being built and of works of
immense magnitude being undertaken for the embellishment of the city;
and we have even now more remains of kingly than we have of consular
Rome.After expelling her kings and shaking off Etruscan influence, Rome
existed as a republic for five centuries, and during this long age of
barbarism she did nothing to advance science or art.Literature was
almost wholly unknown within her walls, and not one monument has come
down to our time, even by tradition, worthy of a city of a tenth part of
her power and magnitude.There is probably no instance in the history of
the world of a capital city existing so long, populous and peaceful at
home, prosperous and powerful abroad, and at the same time so utterly
devoid of any monuments or any magnificence to dignify her existence.When, however, Carthage was conquered and destroyed, when Greece was
overrun and plundered, and Egypt, with her long-treasured art, had
become a dependent province, Rome was no longer the city of the Aryan
Romans, but the sole capital of the civilised world.Into her lap were
poured all the artistic riches of the universe; to Rome flocked all who
sought a higher distinction or a more extended field for their ambition
than their own provincial capitals could then afford.She thus became
the centre of all the arts and of all the science then known; and, so
far at least as quantity is concerned, she amply redeemed her previous
neglect of them.It seems an almost indisputable fact that, during the
three centuries of the Empire, more and larger buildings were erected in
Rome and her dependent cities than ever were erected in a like period in
any part of the world.For centuries before the establishment of the Roman Empire, progressive
development and increasing population, joined to comparative peace and
security, had accumulated around the shores of the Mediterranean a mass
of people enjoying material prosperity greater than had ever been known
before.All this culminated in the first centuries of the Christian era.The greatness of the ancient world was then full, and a more
overwhelming and gorgeous spectacle than the Roman Empire then displayed
never dazzled the eyes of mankind.From the banks of the Euphrates to
those of the Tagus, every city vied with its neighbour in the erection
of temples, baths, theatres, and edifices for public use or private
luxury.In all cases these display far more evidence of wealth and power
than of taste and refinement, and all exhibit traces of that haste to
enjoy, which seems incompatible with the correct elaboration of anything
that is to be truly great.Notwithstanding all this, there is a
greatness in the mass, a grandeur in the conception, and a certain
expression of power in all these Roman remains which never fail to
strike the beholder with awe and force admiration from him despite his
better judgment.These qualities, coupled with the associations that
attach themselves to every brick and every stone, render the study of
them irresistibly attractive.It was with Imperial Rome that the ancient
world perished; it was in her dominions that the new and Christian world
was born.All that was great in Heathendom was gathered within her
walls, tied, it is true, into an inextricable knot, which was cut by the
sword of those barbarians who moulded for themselves out of the
fragments that polity and those arts which will next occupy our
attention.To Rome all previous history tends; from Rome all modern
history springs: to her, therefore, and to her arts, we inevitably turn,
if not to admire, at least to learn, and if not to imitate, at any rate
to wonder at and to contemplate a phase of art as unknown to previous as
to subsequent history, and, if properly understood, more replete with
instruction than any other form hitherto known.Though the lesson we
learn from it is far oftener what to avoid than what to follow, still
there is such wisdom to be gathered from it as should guide us in the
onward path, which may lead us to a far higher grade than it was given
to Rome herself ever to attain.Origin of style—The arch—Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be
called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country
previously occupied by Pelasgians.Their principal neighbour on one side
was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation.On the other hand was Magna Græcia,
which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of
kindred origin.It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the
Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two
people.As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of
both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries
afterwards.Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,
and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in
Roman architecture to its origin.From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with
its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used
it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being
sufficiently large for their purposes.The principal Etruscan temples,
as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half
occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the
portico never extended.The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of
these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its
breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the
building.Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,
but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though
frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns
attached to its walls.Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a
circular form of temple.As applied by the Romans it was generally
encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the
Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from
the Greeks on an Etruscan form.In early times these circular temples
were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown
or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this
distinction was lost sight of.A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the
Etruscans was the circular arch.It was known, it is true, to the
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps
excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their
ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and
introduced it into almost all their buildings.It was not at first used
in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones.In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was
generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders.In the
Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless
network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their
entablatures, is spread over the whole.This is a curious instance of
the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of
Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns
would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some
expedient more correctly constructive.After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the
arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in
advance by applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular
forms of buildings.The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of
the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple
of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so
distant in date.In these buildings the Roman architects so completely
emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to
entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture.It
would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to
the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for
boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the
new method ought to be applied.This is almost universally acknowledged
so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned.In simple grandeur
it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail.It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in
its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet
remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been
quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more
familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately
as the simpler dome of the Pantheon.These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to
which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of
architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors.It
may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman
architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the
semi-Oriental nation seized on its own circular form, and, modifying and
moulding it to its purpose, wrought out the Byzantine style; in which
the dome is the great feature, almost to the total exclusion of the
rectangular form with its intersecting vaults.On the other hand, the
rectangular form was appropriated by the nations of the West with an
equally distinct rejection of the circular and domical forms, except in
those cases in which we find an Eastern people still incorporated with
them.Thus in Italy both styles continued long in use, the one in
baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in
Rome.In France they were so completely fused into each other that it
requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate
them again into their component parts.In England we rejected the
circular form altogether, and so they did eventually in Germany, except
when under French influence.Each race reclaimed its own among the
spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during
its employment in the Imperial city.The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the
numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of
purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles.In
Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs.In
Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in
Etruria to tombs.It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to
deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who
for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture
subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster.It thus
happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find
basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of
triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all
equally objects of architectural skill.The best of these, in fact, are
those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped
with originality.These would have been noble works indeed had it not
been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and
details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to
temples by other nations.In the time of Constantine these orders had
nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative
purposes.In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the
Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before
remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore
still remain an essential part of Roman art.We find the old orders
predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as
we approach that of Constantine.Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the
Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about
half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly simple order of
the Greeks.It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for
monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter.It was, however,
more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter
column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek
style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,
but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman.This fact was apparently
recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple
throughout the Roman world.It would in consequence be most unfair to
institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in
civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world
spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was
devoted to the highest religious purposes.The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally
useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the
other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal
object of its introduction.The keynote of Roman architecture was the
Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,
many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders
together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three
should be reduced to something like harmony.This was accordingly done,
but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in
combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our
admiration.The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the
Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric.They
never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed
it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two.In its own native
East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers
or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no
angles to be turned.When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples
of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at
each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to
one another.In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut
No.142) they used a capital with four faces.The Romans, impatient of
control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over
the extreme difficulty of its employment.With them the angular volutes
became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants
harmony and meaning.When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,
and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this
state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually
deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord
in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to
be found in Roman remains.The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from
that of the other two.The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme
of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have
become incapable of further improvement.The Corinthian, on the
contrary, was a recent conception; and although nothing can surpass the
elegance and grace with which the Greeks adorned it, the new capital
never acquired with them that fulness and strength so requisite to
render it an appropriate architectural ornament.These were added to it
by the Romans, or rather perhaps by Grecian artists acting under their
direction, who thus, as shown in Woodcut No.181, produced an order
which for richness combined with proportion and architectural fitness
has hardly been surpassed.The base is elegant and appropriate; the
shaft is of the most pleasing proportion, and the fluting gives it just
the requisite degree of richness and no more; while the capital, though
bordering on over-ornamentation, is so well arranged as to appear just
suited to the work it has to do.The acanthus-leaves, it is true,
approach the very verge of that degree of direct imitation of nature
which, though allowable in architectural ornaments, is seldom advisable;
they are, however, disposed so formally, and there still remains so much
that is conventional in them, that, though perhaps not justly open to
criticism on this account, they are nevertheless a very extreme example.The entablature is not so admirable as the column.The architrave is too
richly carved.It is evident, however, that this arose from the artist
having copied in carving what the Greeks had only painted, and thereby
produced a complexity far from pleasing.The frieze, as we now find it, is perfectly plain; but this undoubtedly
was not the case when originally erected.It either must have been
painted (in which case the whole order of course was also painted), or
ornamented with scrolls or figures in bronze, which may probably have
been gilt.The cornice is perhaps open to the same criticism as the architrave, of
being over-rich, though this evidently arose from the same cause, viz.,
reproducing in carving what was originally only painted; which to our
Northern eyes at least appears more appropriate for internal than for
external decoration, though, under the purer skies where it was
introduced and used, this remark may be hardly applicable.The order of the portico of the Pantheon is, according to our notions, a
nobler specimen of what an external pillar should be than that of the
Temple of Jupiter Stator.The shafts are of one block, unfluted; the
capital plainer; and the whole entablature, though as correctly
proportional, is far less ornamented and more suited to the greater
simplicity of the whole.The order of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina is another example
intermediate between these two.The columns are in this instance very
similar to those of the Pantheon, and the architrave is plain.The
frieze, however, is ornamented with more taste than any other in Rome,
and is a very pleasing example of those conventional representations of
plants and animals which are so well suited to architectural
purposes—more like Nature than those of the Greeks, but still avoiding
direct imitation sufficiently to escape the affectation of pretending to
appear what it is not and cannot be.The Maison Carrée at Nîmes presents an example of a frieze ornamented
with exquisite taste, while at Baalbec, and in some other examples, we
have them so over-ornamented that the effect is far more offensive, from
utter want of repose, than the frieze in the Temple of Jupiter Stator
ever could be from its baldness.Besides these there are at least fifty varieties of Corinthian capitals
to be found, either in Rome or in various parts of the Roman Empire, all
executed within the three centuries during which Rome continued to be
the imperial city.Some of them are remarkable for that elegant
simplicity which so evidently betrays the hand of a Grecian artist,
while others again show a lavish exuberance of ornament which is but too
characteristic of Roman art in general.Many, however, contain the germs
of something better than was accomplished in that age; and a collection
of them would afford more useful suggestions for designing capitals than
have yet been available to modern artists.Among their various attempts to improve the order which has just been
described, the Romans hit upon one which is extremely characteristic of
their whole style of art.This is known by the distinguishing name of
the Composite order, though virtually more like the typical examples of
the Corinthian order than many of those classed under the latter
denomination.The greatest defect of the Corinthian capital is the weakness of the
small volutes supporting the angles of the abacus.A true artist would
have remedied this by adding to their strength and carrying up the
fulness of the capital to the top.The Romans removed the whole of the
upper part and substituted an Ionic capital instead.Their only original
idea, if it may be so called, in art was that of putting two dissimilar
things together to make one which should combine the beauties of both,
though as a rule the one generally serves to destroy the other.In the
Composite capital they never could hide the junction; and consequently,
though rich, and in some respects an improvement on the order out of
which it grew, this capital never came into general use, and has seldom
found favour except amongst the blindest admirers of all that the Romans
did.Corinthian Base, found in Church of St.In the latter days of the Empire the Romans attempted another innovation
which promised far better success, and with very little more elaboration
would have been a great gain to the principles of architectural design.This was the introduction of the Persian or Assyrian base, modified to
suit the details of the Corinthian or Composite orders.If they had
always used this instead of the square pedestals on which they mounted
their columns, and had attenuated the pillars slightly when used with
arcades, they would have avoided many of the errors they fell into.This
application, however, came too late to be generally used; and the forms
already introduced continued to prevail.At the same time it is evident
that a Persepolitan base for an Ionic and even for a Corinthian column
would be amongst the greatest improvements that could now be introduced,
especially for internal architecture.The true Roman order, however, was not any of these columnar ordinances
we have been enumerating, but an arrangement of two pillars placed at a
distance from one another nearly equal to their own height, and having a
very long entablature, which in consequence required to be supported in
the centre by an arch springing from piers.This, as will be seen from
the annexed woodcut, was in fact merely a screen of Grecian architecture
placed in front of a construction of Etruscan design.Though not without
a certain richness of effect, still, as used by the Romans, these two
systems remain too distinctly dissimilar for the result to be pleasing,
and their use necessitated certain supplemental arrangements by no means
agreeable.In the first place, the columns had to be mounted on
pedestals, or otherwise an entablature proportional to their size would
have been too heavy and too important for a thing so useless and so
avowedly a mere ornament.A projecting keystone was also introduced into
the arch.This was unobjectionable in itself, but when projecting so far
as to do the duty of an intermediate capital, it overpowered the arch
without being equal to the work required of it.The Romans used these arcades with all the 3 orders, frequently one over
the other, and tried various expedients to harmonise the construction
with the ornamentation, but without much effect.They seem always to
have felt the discordance as a blemish, and at last got rid of it, but
whether they did so in the best way is not quite clear.The most obvious
mode of effecting this would no doubt have been by omitting the pillars
altogether, bending the architrave, as is usually done, round the arch,
and then inserting the frieze and cornices into the wall, using them as
a string-course.A slight degree of practice would soon have enabled
them—by panelling the pier, cutting off its angles, or some such
expedient—to have obtained the degree of lightness or of ornament they
required, and so really to have invented a new order.This, however, was not the course that the Romans pursued.What they did
was to remove the pier altogether, and to substitute for it the pillar
taken down from its pedestal.This of course was not effected at once,
but was the result of many trials and expedients.One of the earliest of
these is observed in the Ionic Temple of Concord before alluded to, in
which a concealed arch is thrown from the head of each pillar, but above
the entablature, so as to take the whole weight of the superstructure
from off the cornice between the pillars.When once this was done it was
perceived that so deep an entablature was no longer required, and that
it might be either wholly omitted, as was sometimes done in the centre
intercolumniation, or very much reduced.There is an old temple at
Talavera in Spain, which is a good example of the former expedient; and
the Roman gateway at Damascus is a remarkable instance of the latter.There the architrave, frieze and cornice are carried across in the form
of an arch from pier to pier, thus constituting a new feature in
architectural design.View in Courtyard of Palace at Spalato]

In Diocletian’s reign we find all these changes already introduced into
domestic architecture, as shown in Woodcut No.185, representing the
great court of his palace at Spalato, where, at one end, the entablature
is bent into the form of an arch over the central intercolumniation,
while on each side of the court the arches spring directly from the
capitals of the columns.Had the Romans at this period been more desirous to improve their
external architecture, there is little doubt that they would have
adopted the expedient of omitting the entire entablature: but at this
time almost all their efforts were devoted to internal improvement, and
not unfrequently at the expense of the exterior.Indeed the whole
history of Roman art, from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine,
is a transition from the external architecture of the Greeks to the
internal embellishment of the Christians.At first we see the cells of
the temple gradually enlarged at the expense of the peristyle, and
finally, in some instances, entirely overpowering them.Their basilicas
and halls become more important than their porticoes, and the exterior
is in almost every instance sacrificed to internal arrangements.For an
interior, an arch resting on a circular column is obviously far more
appropriate than one resting on a pier.Externally, on the contrary, the
square pier is most suitable, because a pillar cannot support a wall of
sufficient thickness.This defect was not remedied until the Gothic
architects devised the plan of coupling two or more pillars together;
but this point had not been reached at the time when with the fall of
Rome all progress in art was effectually checked for a time.There is perhaps nothing that strikes the inquirer into the
architectural history of Rome more than the extreme insignificance of
her temples, as compared with the other buildings of the imperial city
and with some contemporary temples found in the provinces.The only
temple which remains at all worthy of such a capital is the Pantheon.All others are now mere fragments, from which we can with difficulty
restore even the plans of the buildings, far less judge of their effect.We have now no means of forming an opinion of the great national temple
of the Capitoline Jove, no trace of it, nor any intelligible
description, having been preserved to the present time.Its having been
of Etruscan origin, and retaining its original form to the latest day,
would lead us to suppose that the temple itself was small, and that its
magnificence, if any, was confined to the enclosure and to the
substructure, which may have been immense.Of the Augustan age we have nothing but the remains of three temples,
each consisting of only three columns; and the excavations that have
been made around them have not sufficed to make even their plans
tolerably clear.The most remarkable was that of Jupiter Stator in the Forum, the
beautiful details of which have been already alluded to and described.It was raised on a stylobate 22 ft.in height, the extreme width of which was 98 ft., and this corresponds
as closely as possible with 100 Roman ft.The height of the pillars was 48 ft., and
that of the entablature 12 ft.[165] It is probable that the whole
height to the apex of the pediment was nearly equal to the extreme
width, and that it was designed to be so.The pillars certainly extended on both flanks, and the temple is
generally restored as peristylar, but apparently without any authority.From the analogy of the other temples it seems more probable that there
were not more than eight or ten pillars on each side, and that the apse
of the cella formed the termination opposite the portico.The temple nearest to this in situation and style is that of Jupiter
Tonans.[166] The order in this instance is of slightly inferior
dimensions to that of the temple just described, and of very inferior
execution.The temple, too, was very much smaller, having only six
columns in front, and from its situation it could not well have had more
than that number on the flanks, so that its extreme dimensions were
probably about 70 ft.The third is the Temple of Mars Ultor, of which a plan is annexed; for
though now as completely decayed as the other two, in the time of Ant.Sabacco and Palladio there seem to have been sufficient remains to
justify an attempt at restoration.As will be seen, it is nearly square
in plan (112 ft.The cella is here a much more important part
than is usual in Greek temples, and terminates in an apse, which
afterwards became characteristic of all places of worship.Behind the
cella, and on each side, was a lofty screen of walls and arches, part of
which still remain, and form quite a new adjunct, unlike anything
hitherto met with attached to any temple now known.(From Cresy’s ‘Rome.’) Scale
100 ft.The next class of temples, called pseudo-peripteral (or those in which
the cella occupies the whole of the after part), are generally more
modern, certainly more completely Roman, than these last.One of the
best specimens at Rome is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, a small
building measuring 72 ft.There is also a very elegant little
Ionic temple of this class called that of Fortuna Virilis; while the
Ionic Temple of Concord, built by Vespasian, and above alluded to,
appears also to have been of this class.So was the temple in the forum
at Pompeii; but the finest specimen now remaining to us is the so-called
Maison Carrée at Nîmes, which is indeed one of the most elegant temples
of the Roman world, owing probably a great deal of its beauty to the
taste of the Grecian colonists long settled in its neighbourhood.It is
hexastyle, with 11 columns in the flanks, 3 of which stand free, and
belong to the portico; the remaining 8 are attached to the walls of the
cella.by 85; but such is the beauty of
its proportions and the elegance of its details that it strikes every
beholder with admiration.Plan of Maison Carrée at Nîmes.The date of this temple has not been satisfactorily ascertained.From
the nail-holes of the inscription on the frieze it has been attempted to
make out the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and there is nothing in
the style of its architecture to contradict this hypothesis.Even if the
buildings in the capital were such as to render this date ambiguous, it
would scarcely be safe to apply any argument derived from them to a
provincial example erected in the midst of a Grecian colony.But for
their evidence we might almost be inclined to fancy its style
represented the age of Trajan.The temple of Diana in the same city is another edifice of singular
beauty of detail, and interesting from the peculiarity of its plan.Exclusive of the portico it is nearly square, 70 ft.by 65, and consists
of a cella which is covered with a stone ribbed vault, the thrust of
which is counteracted by smaller vaults thrown across two side passages
or aisles which are, however, not thrown open to the cella.The columns
in the cella are detached from the wall, which is singularly interesting
as the origin of much which we find afterwards in Gothic work.(A
somewhat similar arrangement is found in the small temple at Baalbec
(Woodcut No.197) where, however, the peristyle occupies the position
and serves the same purpose as the aisles at Nîmes, viz., to resist the
thrust of the vault over the cella.)Plan of Temple of Diana at Nîmes.Throughout this building the details of the architecture are unsurpassed
for variety and elegance by anything found in the metropolis, and are
applied here with a freedom and elegance bespeaking the presence of a
Grecian mind even in this remote corner of the Empire.This was supported by four slender
columns of singularly elegant design, but placed so widely apart that
they could not have carried a stone entablature.It is difficult to
guess what could have been the form of the wooden ones; but a mortice
which still exists in the walls of the temple shows that it must have
been eight or ten feet deep, and therefore probably of Etruscan form
(Woodcut No.167); though it may have assumed a circular arched form
between the pillars.[167]

[Illustration: 189.View of the Interior of the Temple of Diana at
Nîmes.Another peculiarity is, that the light was introduced over the portico
by a great semicircular window, as is done in the Buddhist caves in
India; which, so far as I know, is the most perfect mode of lighting the
interior of a temple which has yet been discovered.Not far from the Colosseum, in the direction of the Forum, are still to
be seen the remains of a great double temple built by the Emperor
Hadrian, and dedicated to Venus and Rome, and consisting of the ruins of
its two cells, each about 70 ft.square, covered with tunnel-vaults, and
placed back to back, so that their apses touch one another.long by 330 wide; and it is generally supposed
that on the edge of this once stood 56 great columns, 65 ft.in height,
thus moulding the whole into one great peripteral temple.Some fragments
of such pillars are said to be found in the neighbourhood, but not one
is now erect,—not even a base is in its place,—nor can any of its
columns be traced to any other buildings.This part, therefore, of the
arrangement is very problematical, and I should be rather inclined to
restore it, as Palladio and the older architects have done, with a
corridor of ten small columns in front of each of the cells.If we could
assume the plan of this temple to have been really peripteral, as
supposed, it must have been a building worthy of the imperial city and
of the magnificence of the emperor to whom its erection is ascribed.More perfect and more interesting than any of these is the Pantheon,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest temples of the ancient world.Externally its effect is very much destroyed by its two parts, the
circular and the rectangular, being so dissimilar in style and so
incongruously joined together.The portico especially, in itself the
finest which Rome exhibits, is very much injured by being prefixed to a
mass which overpowers it and does not harmonise with any of its lines.The pitch, too, of its pediment is perhaps somewhat too high, but,
notwithstanding all this, its sixteen columns, the shaft of each
composed of a single block, and the simple grandeur of the details,
render it perhaps the most satisfactory example of its class.The pillars are arranged in the Etruscan fashion, as they were
originally disposed in front of three-celled temples.As they now stand,
however, they are added unsymmetrically to a rotunda, and in so clumsy a
fashion that the two are certainly not part of the same design and do
not belong to the same age.Either it was that the portico was added to
the pre-existing rotunda, or that the rotunda is long subsequent to the
portico.Unfortunately the two inscriptions on the portico hardly help
to a solution of the difficulty.The principal one states that it was
built by M. Agrippa, but the “it” may refer to the rotunda only, and may
have been put there by those who in the time of Aurelius[168] repaired
the temple which had “fallen into decay from age.” This hardly could,
under any circumstances, be predicated of the rotunda, which shows no
sign of decay during the last seventeen centuries of ill-treatment and
neglect, and may last for as many more without injury to its stability,
but might be said of a portico which, if of wood, as Etruscan porticoes
usually were, may easily in 200 years have required repairs and
rebuilding.From a more careful examination on the spot, I am convinced
that the portico was added at some subsequent period to the rotunda.If
by Agrippa, then the dome must belong to Republican times; if by Severus
it may have been, as is generally supposed, the hall of the Baths of
Agrippa.[169] Altogether I know of no building whose date and
arrangements are so singular and so exceptional as this.Though it is,
and always must have been, one of the most prominent buildings in Rome,
and most important from its size and design, I know of no other building
in Rome whose date or original destination it is so difficult to
determine.Half Elevation, half Section, of the Pantheon at
Rome.Internally perhaps the greatest defect of the building is a want of
height in the perpendicular part, which the dome appears to overpower
and crush.This mistake is aggravated by the lower part being cut up
into two storeys, an attic being placed over the lower order.The former
defect may have arisen from the architect wishing to keep the walls in
some proportion to the portico.The latter is a peculiarity of the age
in which I suppose this temple to have been remodelled, when two or more
storeys seem to have become indispensable requisites of architectural
design.We must ascribe also to the practice of the age the method of
cutting through the entablature by the arches of the great niches, as
shown in the sectional part of the last woodcut.It has already been
pointed out that this was becoming a characteristic of the style at the
time when the circular part of this temple was arranged as it at present
appears.Notwithstanding these defects and many others of detail that might be
mentioned, there is a grandeur and a simplicity in the proportions of
this great temple that render it still one of the very finest and most
sublime interiors in the world, and the dimensions of its dome, 145 ft.span by 147 in height, have not yet been surpassed by any
subsequent erection.Though it is deprived of its bronze covering[170]
and of the greater part of those ornaments on which it mainly depended
for effect, and though these have been replaced by tawdry and
incongruous modernisms, still nothing can destroy the effect of a design
so vast and of a form so simply grand.It possesses moreover one other
element of architectural sublimity in having a single window, and that
placed high up in the building.I know of no other temples which possess
this feature except the great rock-cut Buddhist basilicas of India.In
them the light is introduced even more artistically than here; but,
nevertheless, that one great eye opening upon heaven is by far the
noblest conception for lighting a building to be found in Europe.Besides this great rotunda there are two other circular temples in or
near Rome.The one at Tivoli, shown in plan and elevation in the annexed
woodcuts (Nos.192 and 193), has long been known and admired; the other,
near the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima, has a cell surrounded by twenty
Corinthian columns of singularly slender proportions.Both these
probably stand on Etruscan sites; they certainly are Etruscan in form,
and are very likely sacred to Pelasgic deities, either Vesta or Cybele.Restored Elevation of Temple at Tivoli.Both in dimensions and design they form a perfect contrast to the
Pantheon, as might be expected from their both belonging to the Augustan
age of art: consequently the cella is small, its interior is
unornamented, and all the art and expense is lavished on the external
features, especially on the peristyle; showing more strongly than even
the rectangular temple the still remaining predominance of Grecian
taste, which was gradually dying out during the whole period of the
Empire.It is to be regretted that the exact dates of both these temples are
unknown, for, as that at Tivoli shows the stoutest example of a
Corinthian column known and that in Rome the slenderest, it might lead
to some important deductions if we could be certain which was the older
of the two.It may be, however, that this difference of style has no
connection with the relative age of the two buildings, but that it is
merely an instance of the good taste of the age to which they belong.The Roman example, being placed in a low and flat situation, required
all the height that could be given it; that at Tivoli, being placed on
the edge of a rock, required as much solidity as the order would admit
of to prevent its looking poor and insecure.A Gothic or a Greek
architect would certainly have made this distinction.One more step towards the modern style of round temples was taken before
the fall of the Western Empire, in the temple which Diocletian built in
his palace at Spalato.Internally the temple is circular, 28 ft.in
diameter, and the height of the perpendicular part to the springing of
the dome is about equal to its width.This is a much more pleasing
proportion than we find in the Pantheon; perhaps the very best that has
yet been employed.Externally the building is an octagon, surrounded by
a low dwarf peristyle, very unlike that employed in the older examples.This angularity is certainly a great improvement, giving expression and
character to the building, and affording flat faces for the entrances or
porches; but the peristyle is too low, and mars the dignity of the
whole.[171]

[Illustration: 194.Plan and Elevation of Temple in Diocletian’s Palace
at Spalato.To us its principal interest consists in its being so extremely similar
to the Christian baptisteries which were erected in the following
centuries, and which were copies, but very slightly altered, from
buildings of this class.Even assuming that Hadrian completed the great Temple of Venus at Rome
in the manner generally supposed, it must have been very far surpassed
by the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, which, though
probably not entirely erected, was certainly finished, by that Emperor.It was octastyle in front,[172] with a double range of 20 columns on
each flank so that it could not well have had less than 106 columns, all
about 58 ft.in height, and of the most elegant Corinthian order,
presenting altogether a group of far greater magnificence than any other
temple we are acquainted with of its class in the ancient world.Its
lineal dimensions also, as may be seen from the plan (Woodcut No.195),
were only rivalled by the two great Sicilian temples at Selinus and
Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.wide by 354 in
length, or nearly the same dimensions as the great Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac, from which, however, it differs most materially, that being a
beautiful example of an interior, this depending for all its
magnificence on the external arrangement of its columns.Penrose’s
discoveries in 1884 show that there was an opisthodomus at the rear and
a vestibule or court in front of the cella which may have been hypæthral
so as to admit light into the interior.This arrangement became so
common in the early Christian world that there must have been some
precedent for it; which, in addition to other reasons,[173] strongly
inclines me to believe that the arrangement shown in the plan is
correct.Ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]Plan of Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]The temples of Palmyra and Kangovar have been already mentioned in
speaking of that of Jerusalem, to which class they seem to belong in
their general arrangements, though their details are borrowed from Roman
architecture.This, however, is not the case with the temples at
Baalbec, which taken together and with their accompaniments, form the
most magnificent temple group now left to us of their class and age.The
great temple, if completed (which, however, probably it never was),
would have been about 160 ft.by 290, and therefore, as a Corinthian
temple, only inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.Only nine
of its colossal columns are now standing, but the bases of most of the
others are _in situ_.Scarcely less magnificent than the temple itself
was the court in which it stood, above 380 ft.square, and surrounded on
three sides by recessed porticoes of most exuberant richness, though in
perhaps rather questionable taste.In front of this was a hexagonal
court of very great beauty, with a noble portico of 12 Corinthian
columns, with two square blocks of masonry at each end.The whole extent
of the portico is 260 ft., and of its kind it is perhaps unrivalled,
certainly among the buildings of so late a date as the period to which
it belongs.Elevation of Small Temple at Baalbec.The other, or smaller temple, stands close to the larger.Its
dimensions, to the usual scale, are shown in the plan (Woodcut No.It is larger than any of the Roman peripteral temples, being 117 ft.by
227 ft., or rather exceeding the dimensions of the Parthenon at Athens,
and its portico is both wider and higher than that of the Pantheon at
Rome.Had this portico been applied to that building, the <DW72> of its
pediment would have coincided exactly with that of the upper sloping
cornice, and would have been the greatest possible improvement to that
edifice.As it is, it certainly is the best proportioned and the most
graceful Roman portico of the first class that remains to us in a state
of sufficient completeness to allow us to judge of its effect.The interior of the cella was richly ornamented with niches and
pilasters, and covered with a ribbed and coffered vault, remarkable,
like every part of this edifice, rather for the profusion than for the
good taste of its ornaments.One of the principal peculiarities of this group of buildings is the
immense size of some of the stones used in the substructure of the great
temple: three of these average about 63 ft.A fourth, of similar dimensions, is lying
in the quarry, which it is calculated must weigh alone more than 1100
tons in its rough state, or nearly as much as one of the tubes of the
Britannia Bridge.It is not easy to see why such masses were employed.If they had been used as foundation stones their use would have been
apparent, but they are placed over several courses of smaller stones,
about half-way up the terrace wall, as mere binding stones, apparently
for show.It is true that in many places in the Bible and in Josephus
nothing is so much insisted upon as the immense size of the stones used
in the building of the Temple and the walls of Jerusalem, the bulk of
the materials used appearing to have been thought a matter of far more
importance than the architecture.It probably was some such feeling as
this which led to their employment here, though, had these huge stones
been set upright, as the Egyptians would have placed them, we might more
easily have understood why so great an expense should have been incurred
on their account.As it is, there seems no reason for doubting their
being of the same age as the temples they support, though their use is
certainly exceptional in Roman temples of this class.BASILICAS, THEATRES, AND BATHS.Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius—Provincial basilicas—Theatre at
  Orange—Colosseum—Provincial amphitheatres—Baths of Diocletian.We have already seen that in size and magnificence the temples of Rome
were among the least remarkable of her public buildings.It may be
doubted whether in any respect, in the eyes of the Romans themselves,
the temples were as important and venerable as the basilicas.The people
cared for government and justice more than for religion, and
consequently paid more attention to the affairs of the basilicas than to
those of the temples.Our means for the restoration of this class of
buildings are now but small, owing to their slight construction in the
first instance, and to their materials having been so suitable for the
building of Christian basilicas as to have been extensively used for
that purpose.It happens, however, that the remains which we do possess
comprise what we know to be the ruins of the two most splendid buildings
of this class in Rome, and these are sufficiently complete to enable us
to restore their plans with considerable confidence.It is also
fortunate that one of these, the Ulpian or Trajan’s basilica, is the
typical specimen of those with wooden roofs; the other, that of
Maxentius, commonly called the Temple of Peace, is the noblest of the
vaulted class.Plan of Trajan’s Basilica at Rome.The part shaded darker is all that is uncovered.
]Restored Section of Trajan’s Basilica.The rectangular part of Trajan’s basilica was 180 ft.in width and a
little more than twice that in length, but, neither end having yet been
excavated, its exact longitudinal measurement has not been ascertained.It was divided into five aisles by four rows of columns, each about 35
ft.wide, and the side-aisles 23 ft.The centre was covered by a wooden roof of semicircular
form,[174] covered apparently with bronze plates richly ornamented and
gilt.Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was
supported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang
the arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was
thus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,
though not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was
raised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre
of this platform was the raised seat of the quæstor or other magistrate
who presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the
assessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front
of the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before
commencing any important public business.[175]

Externally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It
was entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and
section) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on
either side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height
as those used internally.These supported statues, or rather, to judge
from the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set
off, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as
this was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to
have prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have
been very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the
structure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the
exception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class
of buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took
the place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always
suggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a
mere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the façade.The interior
of the basilica was, however, the important element to which the
exterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design
which we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,
which were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose
